    "word": "The Lord created man out of the dust of the earth. He made Adam a partaker of His life, His nature. There was breathed into him the breath of the Almighty, and he became a living soul. Adam was perfect in form--strong, comely, pure, bearing the image of his Maker. God gave him a companion, a wife, to share with him the beauties of nature.

To every one of the angelic host is given an appointed task. \n\n\n                                 -327-",
