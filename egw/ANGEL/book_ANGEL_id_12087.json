    "word": "Prepare! Prepare! should be sounded in the ears of the people. For the great day of God's wrath is coming, and who shall be able to stand; and while messengers cry to God to prepare and get ready, they must be awake and have energy themselves and let it tell to all that hear them that they are standing between the living and the dead. Preachers and people who believe the third angel's message should set a holy, lively example. Their conversation and actions should show that they are looking for the appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.--Manuscript 1, 1855, pp. 1,2.
