    "word": "In John 15, He points you to trials, to conflicts. He asks if you can endure the conflict; then He points to eternal realities and shows you the thousands of angels sent to be ministers to those who are heirs of salvation. Though He shows the armies arrayed against you, yet He tells you that you need not be discouraged, for the Captain of the Lord's host is with you as with the Lord's people in Joshua's time. There is the Captain of our salvation who is at work for everyone. What we want is to know how to fight the battle. The victory is not in the minister or the layman, but in the Captain of the Lord's host who fights the battle for us. He dwells with him who is of a contrite spirit. We are to humble our hearts.",
