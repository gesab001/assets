    "word": "Chap. 56 - In Co-Operation with Christ\n\n     I am instructed to say to teachers, ministers, and physicians, who hold responsible positions in the work of the third angel's message, You have a solemn work to do, a holy work. Those who hold positions of trust in the cause of God are to perfect the life after the divine similitude. In the home, in the church, before the world, they are to reveal the power of Christian principle to transform the life. Let them work honestly; let them seek to reveal the spirit of Christ in their work; let them ever strive to reach higher ground. As I realize the perilous times before us and the great responsibilities resting upon teachers, ministers, and physicians, a heavy burden comes upon me lest they be unfaithful in the discharge of duty.",
