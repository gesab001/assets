    "word": "Students, your voice, your influence, your time--all these are gifts from God and are to be used in winning souls to Christ. As teachers and students engage heartily in selling Christ's Object Lessons, they will gain an experience that will fit them to do valuable service in connection with camp meetings. Through the instruction that they can give to the believers in attendance, and through the sale of many books in the places where such meetings are held, those who have been in the school will be able to do their part in reaching the multitudes who need to be given the third angel's message. Let teachers \n                                                                           530\nand students bear their share of the burden in showing our people how to communicate the message to their friends and neighbors.",
