    "word": "Those who are in the habit of indulging in passion and of being impatient will have to overcome it. They will, and must, be perfectly subdued by grace or they can never enter heaven. Jesus is the example that is set before us. He endured all the slight and indignity that could be heaped upon Him, yet He opened not His mouth. He that could have had a legion of angels to assist Him had He asked His Father, was the meek Lamb and was spit upon, crowned with the crown of thorns, and stretched on Calvary's cross, there to die an ignominious death for our sins. Oh, it behooved Christ to suffer all this to make a way of escape for lost man! He was the innocent Sufferer, and shall we dare to complain of any sacrifice we have made or can make? Shall we murmur, who shall suffer something for our own sins? Oh, no! Let us crave the suffering part.",
