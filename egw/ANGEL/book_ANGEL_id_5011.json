    "word": "You need to learn in Christ's school to become Christlike. God adapts His grace to the peculiarities of each one's necessities. \"My grace is sufficient for thee.\" 2 Corinthians 12:9. As your burden grows heavier look up and by faith cling more firmly to the hand of Jesus, your mighty helper. As difficulties thicken about His people amid the perils of the last days, He sends His angels to walk all the way by our side, drawing us closer and still closer to the bleeding side of Jesus. And as the greater trials come, lesser trials are forgotten. . . .",
