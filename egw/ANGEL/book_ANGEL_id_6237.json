    "word": "5 (ch. 13:8; see EGW on chs. 7:9; ch. 20:12-15). Angels Weighing Moral Worth.--Christ says of the overcomer, \"I will not blot out his name out of the book of life.\" The names of all those who have once given themselves to God are written in the book of life, and their characters are now passing in review before Him. Angels of God are weighing moral worth. They are watching the development of character in those now living, to see if their names can be retained in the book of life. A probation is granted us in which to wash our robes of character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. Who is doing this work? Who is separating from himself sin and selfishness (HS 138)?",
