    "word": "MR No. 1208 - A Dream of Angels, God's People, and Salvation\n\n     A dream the Lord gave me August 22. I dreamed of being in a wagon with Brother Rhodes and James, and we were to pass a bridge covered with water. As we passed over the bridge I was much frightened, for the water came into the body of the wagon and it seemed that we were sinking. I had my babe with me and I was so frightened I almost let him fall into the water. Brother Rhodes assured me a number of times that there was no danger and that we must necessarily pass through the water over the bridge.",
