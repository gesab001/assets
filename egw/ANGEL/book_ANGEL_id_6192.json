Under Whose Control?--I want you to consider what kind of a position we should be left in if we had not the ministry of holy angels. . . . \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood.\" We meet the \n                                                                           1120\nopposition of men, but there is someone behind that opposition. It is the prince of the powers of darkness with his evil angels that are constantly at work, and we want to consider, all of us, that our warfare is \"against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world.\"  {6BC 1119.10}  \n     Who is it that is ruling the world today, and who is it that have chosen to stand under the banner of the prince of darkness? Why, it is nearly the whole world at large. All the world that have not accepted Jesus Christ have chosen for their leader the prince of darkness; and just as soon as they stand under his banner, they have connection with evil angels. Either the evil angels or the angels of God are controlling the minds of men. Our minds are given to the control of God, or to the control of the powers of darkness; and it will be well for us to inquire where we are standing today--whether under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel, or under the black banner of the powers of darkness.",
