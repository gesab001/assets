    "word": "Night after night I get up at twelve and one o'clock, and walk the floor in intense anguish because of the tame messages borne by our ministers, when they have a message of life and death to bear to the people. The ministers are asleep; the lay members are asleep; and a world is perishing in sin. Where are the evangelists who can go to the South and work for the people there? Where are the men who have encouraged Elder [S.N.] Haskell? He and his wife are doing a noble work. Not only are they proclaiming the truth, they are training other workers to proclaim the truth in the right way. Do you not think that God requires His people to help a man who is doing as much as Elder Haskell is doing? I know how the Lord regards this matter. It would be well-pleasing to Him for His people to give of their means and their sympathy to those who are working for Him in the cities of America. God has instructed me that His people are neglecting a work that is close beside them.",
