    "word": "The Lord now calls upon me to make plain to others that which has been made plain to me. If men refuse to receive the words of warning, the guilt will be upon their own souls. I am bidden to say, Your soul is in an unsaved state. You are not in harmony with truth and righteousness. What remains for you at the end of your commercial enterprises? What at the end of your strife for supremacy? Can you institute a war against God and His angels to get the supreme place in the heavenly courts? Would you succeed in this effort? And if you should succeed, would heaven be a place in which you would want to live? What kind of a character would you have formed amid your commercial enterprises and your ambition for the highest place? Would you be happy if you could gain even that? No. No.",
