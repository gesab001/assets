    "word": "When the third angel\u2019s message closes, mercy no longer pleads for the guilty inhabitants of the earth. The people of God have accomplished their work. They have received \u201cthe latter rain,\u201d\u201cthe . . . refreshing . . . from \n333\nthe presence of the Lord,\u201d and they are prepared for the trying hour before them. Angels are hastening to and fro in heaven. An angel returning from the earth announces that his work is done; the final test has been brought upon the world, and all who have proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have received \u201cthe seal of the living God.\u201d Then Jesus ceases His intercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts His hands and with a loud voice says, \u201cIt is done.\u201d . . .",
