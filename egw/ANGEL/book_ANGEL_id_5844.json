    "word": "Fearful tests and trials await the people of God. The spirit of war is stirring the nations from one end of the earth to the other. But in the midst of the time of trouble that is coming--a time of trouble such as has not been since there was a nation--God's chosen people will stand unmoved. Satan and his angels cannot destroy them, for angels that excel in strength will protect them.--Letter 119, 1904.",
