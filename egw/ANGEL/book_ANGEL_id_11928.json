    "word": "Elder Starr as an evangelist, and Dr. Kress as a physician connected with the Sanitarium at Washington, working in harmony with each other have done a good work in New York City, and there have been favorable results. If others have been found who can in your absence carry the medical work at the Sanitarium, I believe it would be pleasing to the Lord for you to continue to labor with Brother and Sister Starr or some other evangelist, in some of our large cities. It may be necessary for you at times to be called to the Sanitarium, as a counselor, but in your absence, others must necessarily take largely the burden of the work there.",
