    "word": "The third angel's message is infallible. It is to unite a people to do a special work, preparing them with perfection of character to unite in one great family in the mansions Christ has gone to prepare for those who love Him. And all the laborers are God's workmen to present infallible truth, to do the work of blending hearts in one. Never let your words or your efforts be directed to the end to disunite that which God would have united. You should influence France to work for the upbuilding of the cause in Switzerland. Do not encourage a one-sided interest, but all labor to cement together that they may have a molding influence on one another, that if any of the nationalities are encouraging peculiar ideas, that one may have a reformatory influence upon the other. Urge upon all to receive Christ's mold and imitate Christ's character. The apostle states, \"Ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Christ in the German believer will recognize Christ in the French believer.",
