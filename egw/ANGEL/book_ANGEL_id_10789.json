    "word": "The Father is the vine-dresser. He skillfully and mercifully prunes every fruit-bearing branch. Those who share Christ's suffering and reproach now, will share his glory hereafter. He \"will not be ashamed to call them brethren.\" His angels minister to them. His second appearing will be as the Son of man, thus even in his glory identifying him with humanity.

Thou art continually before me.\"",
