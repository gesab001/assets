    "word": "The work is not yours, but the Lord's; and none are to become fainthearted. The angels have a constant care over the work. . . . The enemy is seeking to use every device which will cripple this institution. He seeks to make it a common thing through those whom He connects with it. When the workers are educated to think of this great center as related to God and under His supervision, when they realize that it is a channel through which light from heaven is to be communicated to the world, great respect and reverence will be shown to it. The best thoughts and noblest feelings will be cultivated and brought into the work, that the heavenly intelligences may cooperate with human beings.",
