Much time and money has been absorbed among us in ways that bring no returns. Instead of this, some of our best talent should be set at work for the W.C.T.U., not as evangelists, but as those who fully appreciate the good that has been done by this body. We should seek to gain the confidence of the workers of the W.C.T.U. by harmonizing with them as far as possible. We are to let them see and understand that the foundation of the principles of our doctrine is the Word of God.",
