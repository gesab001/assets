    "word": "When men are careless of the Saviour's presence, and in their conversation make no reference to him in whom they profess that their hopes of eternal life are centered, Jesus is not in their company, and the holy angels are grieved from their presence. These pure and heavenly beings cannot remain where the presence of Jesus is not desired and encouraged, and where his absence is not marked. They are not attracted to the crowd where minds are diverted from heavenly things. For this reason, great mourning, grief, and \n146\ndiscouragement exist among the professed followers of Christ. By neglect of meditation, watchfulness, and prayer, they lose all that is valuable. The divine rays of light emanating from Jesus are not with them, cheering them with their holy, elevating influence. They are enshrouded in gloom, because their careless, irreverent spirit has separated Jesus from their company, and driven from them the ministering angels.",
