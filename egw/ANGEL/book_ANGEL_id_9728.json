    "word": "While engaged in his round of duties he [Moses] saw a bush, branches, foliage, and trunk, all burning, yet not consumed. He drew near to view the wonderful sight, when a voice addressed him from out of the flame. It was the voice of God. It was He who, as the angel of the covenant, had revealed Himself to the fathers in ages past. The frame of Moses quivered, he was thrilled with terror as the Lord called him by name. With trembling lips he answered, \u201cHere am I.\u201d He was warned not to approach his Creator with undue familiarity: \u201cPut off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\u201d \u201cAnd Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\u201d\u2014ST Feb. 26, 1880.",
