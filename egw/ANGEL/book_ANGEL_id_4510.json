    "word": "What a noble enterprise? One soul to praise God through eternity! One soul to enjoy happiness and everlasting life! One gem in their crown to shine as a star forever and ever! But even more than one can be brought to turn from error to truth, from sin to holiness. Says the Lord by the prophet, \"And they that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever.\" Then those who engage with Christ and angels in the work of saving perishing souls are richly rewarded in the kingdom of heaven. \n                                                                           206",
