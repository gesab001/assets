    "word": "I rejoice that you have taken up this evangelistic work in Washington, and that so deep an interest has already been aroused. The accounts given regarding the work there correspond as nearly as possible to the representation given me of what would be. I am sure, for the matter has been presented to me, and this work must not be weakened by the necessary laborers being called to other places. The work in the South need not hold Elder Daniells and Elder Washburn long. Elder Butler is there, and there are other men who can come in to help. \n                                                                           384",
