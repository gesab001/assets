    "word": "This is the service done to Jesus Christ that will be recognized at the last day. The worker has not made himself prominent, but [has] just picked up the opportunities and privileges to do work for the Master which God alone counts of precious value. The little fillings in, the cup of cold water given, the word spoken in due season, all these count, and yet they have not been treasured up by the actor as any wonderful work \"I have done.\" The labor of love for Christ's sake, if treasured by the giver ends there, for he has all the reward he will ever have. But if he does this work for Christ's sake, thinking not of the matter afterward, angels of God gather up these incidents and cherish them as precious pearls.",
