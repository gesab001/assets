    "word": "Ella White is still at Reno, Nevada. Her school closes this week. One of the public schools there wants her to teach in its primary division for a few weeks. I think that she will. Mabel is now at Paradise Valley, San Diego. She left here last Thursday, and on her way to San Diego she called at Mountain View and spent a few hours with her father. At Los Angeles, she spent a little time at the Glendale Sanitarium. I expect to receive a letter from her soon, saying that she reached San Diego safely.",
