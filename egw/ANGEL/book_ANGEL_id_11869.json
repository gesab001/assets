    "word": "Bro. Starr came from a sale of goods a few days ago. He said, \"I did so want to purchase a wardrobe, a beautiful piece of furniture, with mirror in front, that went for less than four pounds when it must have cost ten, but I remembered we are pilgrims and strangers, and decided not to buy it.\" I said, \"You did right. I do not want even the appearance of costly furniture in my house; for it would contrast strangely with the other articles.\" He bought two plain, old-fashioned little bureaus for me, one costing five, the other three dollars, and a second-hand washstand for himself for a small sum. This is the way we have worked. We are getting everything for durability, things that will bear rough handling and transporting from place to place, and not break and crush to pieces. We have been and still are very hard-pressed for means. The Lord sees it all, He will not leave us in destitution, although in strait places. The one thousand dollars which you say is forthcoming will \n\n\n                                   -135- \n\nsupply our present necessities and keep the machinery moving.--Ms 23, 1894, p. 9. (Untitled, April 9, 1894.)",
