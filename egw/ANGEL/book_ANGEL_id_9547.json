    "word": "There never will be a time in the history of the church when God\u2019s workers can fold their hands and be at ease, saying, \u201cAll is peace and safety.\u201d Then it is that sudden destruction cometh.

The contest will wax more and more fierce on the part of Satan; for he is moved by a power from beneath.",
