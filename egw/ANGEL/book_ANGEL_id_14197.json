    "word": "Great good will result by bringing these books before the women of the W.C.T.U. Invite these workers to your meetings, and give them an opportunity to become acquainted with our people. Place these books in their hands, and tell them the story of their gift to the cause and its object. Explain how by the sale of \"Ministry of Healing\", patients will be brought to the Sanitarium for healing who could never get there unaided, and how through this means also sanitariums will be established in places where they are needed. If our sanitariums are managed wisely by men and women who have the fear of God before them, the workers in the temperance cause will not be slow to see the advantage of this branch of the work. If you will in earnestness and faith work out the plan that God has laid down, angels of God will attend your steps, and the blessing of heaven will be upon your efforts.",
