    "word": "The whole chapter is full of importance and is of consequence to every human agent. Consider this matter; it will bear close searching. The men who are denying the Sabbath instituted by God Himself, who are trampling upon the commandments of God, are the devil's spies who seek to find accusation against those who will not reverence a man-made institution and worship an idol sabbath. The observance of the seventh day according to the commandment \n\n\n                                  -96- \n\nreveals to them a neglect of duties which they owe to God. If there was not a people voicing the third angel's message, they would have no conscientious scruples for Sunday observance, but it is the truth that they do not wish to receive. The Jews did not want their customs and practices to be disturbed; neither do the professed Christian world of today wish to be disturbed. They reject the message of truth which God in mercy hath sent to them to arouse their moral sensibilities. The Jews treated Christ just as professed Christians of today would treat Him should He come as He did at His first advent.",
