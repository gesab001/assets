    "word": "The world is full of hurry and disappointment. The words are addressed to you, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" The words in favor of truth, spoken with the assurance that comes from the possession of a right purpose, and in cheerful hope, from a pure heart, will make the angels rejoice. The Lord would have us spiritually minded, that we may be able to see the working out of His plans in our lives. We are to be laborers together with God in accomplishing the work that He would have done. Wherever we are, we are to reflect light.",
