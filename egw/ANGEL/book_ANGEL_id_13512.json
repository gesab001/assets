    "word": "The men who are engaged in the work in the publishing house need divine enlightenment in all their business transactions. Everything that relates to the work is to be done with the strictest integrity, not only with those of our faith, but with nonbelievers. The angels of God are watching all the workers, to help all those who need help and whose hearts are drawn out for help. Every transaction of man with his fellow man must be characterized by the purest equity. One man is not to be highly favored and another put down as a footstool, for God declares He will judge for these things.",
