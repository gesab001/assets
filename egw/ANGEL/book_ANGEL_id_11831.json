    "word": "God designs that the plan of redemption shall come to His people as the latter rain; for they are fast losing their connection with God. They are trusting in man, and glorifying man, and their strength is proportionate to the strength of their dependence. Some matters have been opened before me which will be fulfilled ere long. We are to know more than we do at the present time. We are to comprehend the deep things of God. There are themes to be dwelt upon which are worthy of more than a passing notice. Angels have desired to look into the truths which are revealed to the people who are searching God's word and with contrite hearts praying for wisdom, for greater lengths and breadths and heights of that knowledge which God alone can give.--Manuscript 75, 1899,  p. 4.
