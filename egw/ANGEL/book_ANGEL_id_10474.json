    "word": "Those who had been the bitterest opponents of the gospel became its champions. The prophecy was fulfilled, that the weak shall be \"as David,\" and the house of David \"as the angel of the Lord.\" Every Christian saw in his brother the divine similitude of love and benevolence. One interest prevailed. One subject of emulation swallowed up all others. The only ambition of the believers was to reveal the likeness of Christ's character and to labor for the enlargement of His kingdom.",
