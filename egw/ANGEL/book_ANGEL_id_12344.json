    "word": "Oh, what a sight it would be for angels to look upon, to see God's instrumentalities passing out of the hands of those who can handle them for the advancement of His work! Christians, now is your time to come up to the help of the Lord. The Lord's treasures are at hand, lent to us in trust to be used in just such emergencies. He speaks to us all. Hear what He says. \"The gold and silver is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.\" [See Haggai 2:8; Psalms 50:10.] Then, stewards of the Lord, use the Master's entrusted goods to free His institutions in Denmark and Norway from debt. Angels of God will cooperate with us in helping these institutions, so that no reproach shall rest upon the Lord's cause.",
