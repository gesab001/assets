    "word": "The outposts are to be kept guarded. There are to be men to hold the fort, while the advancing forces are engaged in active warfare. To every man is given his work. We are not to echo the words of those in error, but to inculcate ideas of truth; our work is to benefit our fellow-men, we are not to travel over the track of opponents to the truth, but to sound the message of the third angel, who is flying in the midst of heaven, proclaiming the note of warning, the commandments of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ.",
