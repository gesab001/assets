    "word": "Cultivate Self-respect.--It is not pleasing to God that you should demerit yourself. You should cultivate self-respect by living so that you will be approved by your own conscience and before men and angels. . . . It is your privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed, and to stand before the law without shame or remorse. \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit\" (Romans 8:1). While we should not think of ourselves more highly than we ought, the Word of God does not condemn a proper self-respect. As sons and daughters of God, we should have a conscious dignity of character, in which pride and self-importance have no part.--RH, Mar 27, 1888. (HC 143.)",
