    "word": "We pass through this world but once. Let every step taken by those who claim to be sons and daughters of God be forward. Listen to the words of Christ: He that \"will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me\" [Matthew 16:24]. This alone will designate each of us as His disciples. Are we witnessing before the angels of heaven and before the worlds unfallen that we as human beings recognize that we understand what this means, \"Ye are not your own. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's\" [1 Corinthians 6:19, 20].",
