    "word": "Jesus stood meek and humble before the infuriated multitude, while they offered Him the vilest abuse.\n215\nThey spat in His face--that face from which they will one day desire to hide, which will give light to the city of God and shine brighter than the sun. Christ did not cast upon the offenders an angry look. They covered His head with an old garment, blindfolding Him, and then struck Him in the face and cried out, \"Prophesy, who was it that smote Thee?\" Luke 22:64. There was commotion among the angels. They would have rescued Him instantly, but their commanding angels restrained them.",
