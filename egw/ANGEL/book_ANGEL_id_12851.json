    "word": "Bible knowledge, practiced, is true godliness, and is profitable to all men. It brings every one into new relations with God. It turns man's mind from the earth heavenward, and makes the repentant sinner a new creature in Christ Jesus. The transforming grace of God leads men to take upon themselves the yoke of Christ, and to become \"laborers together with God.\" Thus through grace man becomes one with the Father, and gives to the world unmistakable evidence of what the truth can do in sanctifying the receiver. Enlightened by daily partaking of the Word, man becomes a spectacle to the unfallen worlds, to angels, and to his fellow men.",
