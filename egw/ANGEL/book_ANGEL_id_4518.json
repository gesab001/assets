    "word": "Those who enter the work as \"eye-servants,\" will find that their work cannot bear the inspection of men or of angels. The thing essential for successful work is a knowledge of Christ; for this knowledge will give sound principles of right, impart a noble, unselfish spirit, like that of our Saviour whom we profess to serve. Faithfulness, economy, care-taking, thoroughness, should characterize all our work, wherever we may be, whether in the kitchen, in the workshop, in the office of publication, in the sanitarium, in the college, or wherever we are stationed in the vineyard of the Lord. \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\"--Review and Herald, September 22, 1891. \n\n(232)",
