    "word": "The Prince of life once came from heaven to earth, for our sake to bear insult and mockery and death. Preparation is now being made in heaven for his reign in glory, and the message must be proclaimed to all nations, tongues, and peoples. Many seem to rest perfectly easy, as if heavenly messengers were to come to earth to proclaim in an audible voice the message of warning; but while angels have their work to do, we are to do ours in opening the word of God to those who are in darkness.",
