    "word": "GOD\u2019S PROMISE TO ELLEN WHITE.\u2014The Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings were given me, and an angel attended me from the city to a place that was bright and glorious. . . . I begged of my attending angel to let me remain in that place. I could not bear the thought of coming back to this dark world again. Then the angel said, \u201cYou must go back, and if you are faithful, you, with the \n89\n144,000, shall have the privilege of visiting all the worlds and viewing the handiwork of God.\u201dEW 39, 40.",
