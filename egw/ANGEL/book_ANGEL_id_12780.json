    "word": "MR No. 1344 - Work Earnestly for the Unsaved\n\n     When we engage with all our hearts in the work, we are closely allied to the angels; we are co-workers with the angels and with Christ, and there is sympathy with heaven and with us, a holy, elevated sympathy. We are brought a little closer to heaven, a little closer to the angelic hosts, a little closer to Jesus.",
