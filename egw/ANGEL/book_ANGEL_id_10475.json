    "word": "The last words of Christ [to His disciples] were, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature\" (Mark 16:15). And spreading His hands above them in benediction, He ascended to heaven, surrounded by hosts of heavenly angels who had come to escort Him on His way to the portals of God. His last commission to His disciples made them the agents whereby His gospel of glad tidings was to go to the nations. This was Christ's last will and testament to His followers who walked with Him during the years of His earthly ministry, and to those who should believe on Him through their word. His first work in heaven was in harmony with His last commission on earth; for He sent the promise of the Father upon them. On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the praying disciples, and they testified as to its source to all, wherever they went.",
