    "word": "There are many things in this world that cast bright lights into our life experience. We have the evidence day by day that the Lord is working through the ministration of His angels in our school at Cooranbong. In His word the Lord is giving the most precious, noble thoughts to our students. . . . All have every advantage in the school to have their minds carried upward to a higher level and to a purer, clearer atmosphere, where the Lord can communicate with them individually.--Ms 175, 1897, pp. 3, 4 (Diary, Aug. 1-31, 1897.) \n\nReleased Feb. 28, 1967.",
