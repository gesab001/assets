    "word": "A MARVEL TO THE UNIVERSE.\u2014This is the mystery of godliness. That Christ should take human nature, and by a \n76\nlife of humiliation elevate man in the scale of moral worth with God: that He should carry His adopted nature to the throne of God, and there present His children to the Father, to have conferred upon them an honor exceeding that conferred upon the angels\u2014this is the marvel of the heavenly universe, the mystery into which angels desire to look. This is love that melts the sinner\u2019s heart.\u2014Ms 21, 1900 quoted in SD 22.",
