    "word": "Our colored brethren and sisters have a large work to do for their own people. I have been much pleased to see the work that Brother Staines is seeking to do at the Hillcrest School farm. We saw at that place students who are preparing for the service of the Lord. The angels of heaven will surround these students as they seek to fit themselves for labor. The Lord is just as willing to help these students prepare for the work they have to do as He is to help the white students as they qualify themselves to labor for Christ. He is the willing Saviour and helper of all. As this work is continued, we will find prejudice arise, and this will be manifested in various ways; but we must have wisdom to labor in such a way that we shall not lose the interest of either party, the white or the colored.--Ms 17, 1909, p. 2. (From sermon, April 25, 1909, in Nashville colored church.) \n\n\n                                    -34-",
