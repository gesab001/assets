Glendale, Los Angeles, Calif. \n                           Sept. 4, 1905. \n\n\n     We have recently purchased another sanitarium property, known as Loma Linda. I am most grateful to the Lord for making it possible for us to secure this property. It lies sixty miles east of Los Angeles, on the main line of the Southern Pacific Railway. Its name, Loma Linda,--\"Beautiful Hill\"--describes the place. Of the 76 acres comprised in the property, about thirty-five form a beautiful hill, which rises one hundred and twenty-five feet above the valley. Upon this hill the sanitarium building is situated.",
