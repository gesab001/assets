PAGE 206.--WILLIAM MILLER'S VIEWS AS TO THE EXACT TIME OF THE SECOND ADVENT WERE BASED ON THE PROPHECY OF DANIEL 8:14: \"UNTO TWO THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED DAYS; THEN SHALL THE SANCTUARY BE CLEANSED.\" THAT A DAY IN SYMBOLIC PROPHECY REPRESENTS A YEAR, SEE NUMBERS 14:34; EZEKIEL 4:6. AS THE PERIOD OF 2300 PROPHETIC DAYS, OR LITERAL YEARS, EXTENDED FAR BEYOND THE CLOSE OF THE JEWISH DISPENSATION, IT COULD NOT REFER TO THE SANCTUARY OF THAT DISPENSATION. MR. MILLER HELD THE GENERALLY RECEIVED VIEW THAT IN THE CHRISTIAN AGE THE EARTH IS THE SANCTUARY, AND HENCE CONCLUDED THAT THE CLEANSING OF THE SANCTUARY BROUGHT TO VIEW IN DANIEL 8:14 REPRESENTED THE PURIFICATION OF THE EARTH BY FIRE AT THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST. THE POINT FROM WHICH TO RECKON THE 2300 DAYS IS FOUND IN DANIEL 9:24-27, WHICH IS AN EXPLANATION OF THE VISION OF CHAPTER 8. IT IS STATED THAT 70 WEEKS, OR 490 YEARS, ARE DETERMINED, LITERALLY, CUT OFF, AS SPECIALLY PERTAINING TO THE JEWS. THE ONLY PERIOD FROM WHICH THE 70 WEEKS COULD BE CUT OFF IS THE 2300 DAYS, THAT BEING THE ONLY PERIOD OF TIME MENTIONED IN THE VISION OF CHAPTER 8. THE 70 WEEKS MUST THEREFORE BE A PART OF THE 2300 DAYS, AND THE TWO PERIODS MUST BEGIN TOGETHER. THE 70 WEEKS ARE DECLARED BY THE ANGEL TO DATE FROM THE GOING FORTH OF THE COMMANDMENT TO RESTORE AND BUILD JERUSALEM. IF, THEN, WE CAN CORRECTLY LOCATE THIS COMMANDMENT, WE HAVE THE STARTING-POINT FOR THE GREAT PERIOD OF THE 2300 DAYS. THE BIBLE FURNISHES US WITH FOUR TESTS BY WHICH WE MAY DETERMINE WHEN THE TRUE DATE IS FOUND:--",
