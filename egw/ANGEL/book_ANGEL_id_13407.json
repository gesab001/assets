This statement is not true. It is an extravagant, exaggerated statement. If it is made in the discussion of this question I shall feel it my duty to set this matter before all that are assembled, and whether they hear or forbear, tell them the statement is incorrect.

There has been a spirit of Pharisaism coming in among us which I shall lift my voice against wherever it may be revealed.\" \n                                                                           221",
