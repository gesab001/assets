    "word": "Sowing and Reaping \n\n     Not one word too much has been said in vindication and praise of genuine medical missionary work. Connected with other lines of gospel work, medical missionary work is the instrument by which the ground is prepared for the sowing of the seed of truth, and the instrument also by which the harvest is reaped. If all our ministers had received and practiced the light that God had given on health reform, the needy and the outcasts would be embraced in every evangelistic effort to as much larger extent than they have been. With medical missionary work acting as the helping hand of the gospel ministry, the sick would be restored to health, and many souls would be led into the light. . . .",
