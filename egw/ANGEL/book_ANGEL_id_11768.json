    "word": "We must do a thorough work in education. The youth in our offices of publication should receive practical instruction in every line of work connected with the printing of books. Then, if the providence of God shall lead them to other countries, they can learn the language, and be able to print for the people in that country, the truth that God has committed to us, which must go to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. The Lord is sending His angels, preparing the hearts of the people to receive the truth. And if we are only consecrated to His service, we shall be sent forth in the spirit and power of Elijah.",
