    "word": "Cooperation of God and Man in Salvation \n     A Partaker of the Divine Nature. He who cooperates with God, striving earnestly to separate himself from the world and its corrupt influences, becomes a partaker of the divine nature, \"having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\" Can those who realize that they are members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ, degrade a nature that, through the merits of Christ, is related to angels, to Christ, yea, and to God Himself? Can those who realize the possibilities before them, who know that they are called to receive an immortal inheritance, to reign as kings and priests on the earth, fail to use every power of their being in an effort to become one with Christ? . . .",
