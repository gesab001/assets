    "word": "Medical missionary evangelists will be able to do excellent pioneer work. The work of the minister will blend fully with that of the medical missionary evangelist. Christian physicians are not to regard their missionary work as inferior to that of the ministry. A consecrated physician bears a double responsibility; for in him are combined the qualifications of the physician with those of the gospel minister. His is a grand, a sacred, and a very necessary work.",
