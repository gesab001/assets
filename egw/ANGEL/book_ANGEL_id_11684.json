    "word": "Star, God Reached Magi Through a.--You will see that in every place God works after the manner that He can best reach the people. When He came to reveal Christ to the Magi, He did not come to them as He did to the shepherds on the plains of Bethlehem. The wise men were reading the works of God in the heavens. \"The heavens declare the glory of God,\" and God comes to them to educate them in the very manner that He could best reach them. He has a star, a wonderful star, to appear to them.
