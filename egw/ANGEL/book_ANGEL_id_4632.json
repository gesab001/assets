    "word": "Conscience and Individuality to Be Untrammeled. --In matters of conscience the soul must be left untrammeled. No one is to control another's mind, to judge for another, or to prescribe his duty. God gives to every soul freedom to think and to follow his own convictions. \"Every one of us shall give account of himself to God\" (Romans 14:12). No one has a right to merge his own individuality in that of another. In all matters where principle is involved, \"let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind\" (verse 5). In Christ's kingdom there is no lordly oppression, no compulsion of manner. The angels of heaven do not come to the earth to rule and to \n\n708 \n\nexact homage, but as messengers of mercy, to cooperate with men in uplifting humanity.--DA 550, 551 (1898).",
