    "word": "All are to work for unity and harmony of purpose. Everything that is done in connection with the work of God must be divinely done. Truth is something that must be passed on to others. There are souls to be saved, souls who must have the truth for this time from the Word of God, to prepare them for that which is opening before us. Satan is moving with intensity from beneath and is bringing all his forces to bear to unsettle those who have once been established in the truth. These are the very ones who, by yielding up the truth which they have once advocated, can do the greatest harm to the cause of God. Quite a large number will enter this path because the truth they once believed has not been brought into their life-practice. But those who depart from the faith and refuse to give the last message of warning to the world will walk in paths in which the Lord does not lead. Satan goes before them clothed as an angel of light. They will follow on in false paths until they shall discern what is comprehended in the wrath of the Lamb.--Letter 98a, 1897, pp. 6-8, 10-19. (To Bro. McCullaugh, Apr. 9, 1897.) \n\nWhite Estate, Washington, D. C. August 28, 1980",
