    "word": "Weak and trembling souls, those who have many defects and objectionable traits of character, are the special charge of the angels of God. \"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\" If any injustice is done to them, it is the same as if done to Jesus Himself. Christ identifies His interest with that of the souls He has purchased at an infinite cost.",
