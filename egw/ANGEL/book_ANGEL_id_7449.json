    "word": "Satan tempts children to be reserved to their parents, and choose their young and inexperienced  companions as their confidants; such as cannot help them, but give them bad advice. Young girls and boys get together and chat, and laugh, and joke, and drive Christ out of their hearts, and angels from their presence, by their foolish nonsense. Unprofitable conversation upon the acts and doings of others, small talk about this young man, or that girl, withers noble,  devotional thoughts or feelings, and drives good and holy desires from the heart, and leaves it cold and destitute of true love for God and his truth.",
