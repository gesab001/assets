    "word": "Pastoral Evangelism \n     Let everyone who has eaten of the bread which came down from heaven labor in all simplicity to teach others what they must do to be saved. . . . Those who are not doing their duty, who are not helping others to see the importance of the truth for this time, must feel dissatisfied with themselves. Satan takes advantage of this feature in their experience, and leads them to criticize and find fault. If they were busily engaged in seeking to know and do the will of God, they would feel such a burden for perishing souls, such an unrest of mind, that they could not be restrained from fulfilling the commission, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,\" \"teaching them . . . all things whatsoever I have commanded.\"--Letter 169, 1904, pp. 6, 7. (To the Ministers in Southern California, April 27, 1904.)",
