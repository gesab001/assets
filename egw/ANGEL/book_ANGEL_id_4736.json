    "word": "These admonitions have been strangely neglected. Even among those who profess to be Christians, true hospitality is little exercised. Among our own people the opportunity of showing hospitality is not regarded as it should be, as a privilege and blessing. There is altogether too little sociability, too little of a disposition to make room for two or three more at the family board, without embarrassment or parade. Some plead that \"it is too much trouble.\" It would not be if you would say: \"We have made no special preparation, but you are welcome to what we have.\" By the unexpected guest a welcome is appreciated far more than is the most elaborate preparation. . . .",
