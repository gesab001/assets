    "word": "In ministry to the sick, we have before us the work that Christ would have us do in behalf of our fellow men in every place where we can teach and practice the true principles of healing for both soul and body. Our time for work is short, and we must be more in earnest. There is a great work to be done, and we need means with which to do this work. Said Christ, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Shall we not follow Him in self-denial and sacrifice, laboring with all our power to prepare men and women, physically and spiritually, for the coming of Christ? For the Son of man is coming in His glory, with all the holy angels, and then will He fulfill the promise made to His disciples: \"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.\" --Unpub. MS. dated August 3, 1905. (MS- 144-'05)",
