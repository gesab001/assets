    "word": "This message [Revelation 14:6, 7] is declared to be a part of \"the everlasting gospel.\" The work of preaching the gospel has not been committed to angels, but has been entrusted to men. Holy angels have been employed in directing this work, they have in charge the great movements for the salvation of men; but the actual proclamation of the gospel is performed by the servants of Christ upon the earth.",
