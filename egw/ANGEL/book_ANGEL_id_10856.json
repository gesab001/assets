    "word": "To those having families I will say, There is a work to be done for your children in your homes. Speak kindly to them. They are the Lord's property; his heritage. You have no right to create unhappiness in their lives. In the home it is the privilege of these children to prepare for the heavenly mansions. By no better way than by their own example can parents help the youth to gain this preparation. They are to learn by example as well as by precept that there must be no coarseness, no unkindness where Angels of God dwell.",
