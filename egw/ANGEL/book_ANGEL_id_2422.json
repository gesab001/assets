    "word": "Faint not. Cast yourself at the feet of Jesus, who has been tempted, and knows how to help such as are tempted. . . . Plead your case before God, through Jesus, until your soul can with confidence rely upon Him for strength, and you feel that you are not left to do the work of overcoming alone. God will help you.

Watch and pray. \n                                                                           225",
