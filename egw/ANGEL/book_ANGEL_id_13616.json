    "word": "The Jews had proudly boasted that Christ was to come as a king, to conquer his enemies, and tread down the heathen in his wrath. But the humble submissive life our Saviour led, which should have enshrined him in the hearts of his people, and given them confidence in his mission, offended and disappointed the Jews, and we all know of the treatment he received from them. If the angels of God had not been round about him to protect him, the people he came to save would have killed him.",
