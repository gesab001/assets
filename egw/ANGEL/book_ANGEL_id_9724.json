    "word": "8: Angels at the Time of the Exodus\n\nThe Birth of Moses\n     As time rolled on, [Joseph] the great man to whom Egypt owed so much . . . passed to the grave. And \u201cthere arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.\u201d . . . \u201cAnd he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.\u201d . . . . Orders were issued . . . to destroy the Hebrew male children at their birth. Satan was the mover in this matter. He knew that a deliverer was to be raised up among the Israelites; and by leading the king to destroy their children he hoped to defeat the divine purpose. . . .",
