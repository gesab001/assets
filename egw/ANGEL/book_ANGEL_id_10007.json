    "word": "Peter mechanically obeyed; but so entranced was he with the revelation of the glory of heaven that he\n233\ndid not think to take his cloak. Then the angel bade him: \u201cCast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
