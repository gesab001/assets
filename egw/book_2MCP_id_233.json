{"word": "In the Christian world today fraud is practiced to a fearful extent. God's commandment-keeping people should show that they are above all these things. The dishonest practices which mar the dealing of man with his fellowman should never be practiced by one who professes to be a believer in present truth. God's people do great harm to the truth by the least departure from integrity.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 437}
