Their whole energy is absorbed in business enterprises, and they feel obliged to neglect things of a spiritual nature. Thus they separate themselves from God. . . .

But many become so absorbed in business that they have no time for prayer, no time for the study of the Bible, no time to seek and serve God.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 223}
