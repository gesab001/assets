{"word": "Moses, the first historian, gives quite a definite account of social and individual life in the early days of the world's history, but we find no record that an infant was born blind, deaf, crippled, or imbecile. Not an instance is recorded of a natural death in infancy, childhood, or early manhood. . . .

Since then the average length of life has been decreasing.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 143}
