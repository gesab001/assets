    "word": "The apostle Peter says: \"Likewise, ye younger, submit \n                                                                           108\nyourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.\" Paul exhorts: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another,\" \"submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.\" \"Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.\" Unless the advice and counsel of the church can be respected, it is indeed powerless. God has placed a voice in the church which must control its members.",
