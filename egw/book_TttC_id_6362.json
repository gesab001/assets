    "word": "Truth has a power to elevate the receiver. If Bible truth exerts its sanctifying influence upon the heart and character, it will make believers more intelligent.

Only by a continual improvement of the intellectual as well as the moral powers can we hope to answer the purpose of our Creator.",
