Says Christ: \"Ye are My friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.\" This is the condition imposed; this is the test that proves men's characters.

The test is: What are you doing for Christ? What sacrifices are you making? What victories are you gaining? A selfish spirit overcome, a temptation to neglect duty resisted, passion subdued, and willing, cheerful obedience rendered to the will of Christ are far greater evidences that you are a child of God than spasmodic piety and emotional religion.",
