    "word": "\"After we were seated in the cars, I lay down and rested about one hour. We had an appointment that evening at West-brook, Maine, to meet the brethren from Portland and vicinity. \n                                                                           654\nWe made our home with the kind family of Brother Martin. I was not able to sit up during the afternoon; but, being urged to attend the meeting in the evening, I went to the schoolhouse, feeling that I had not strength to stand and address the people. The house was filled with deeply interested listeners. Brother Andrews opened the meeting, and spoke a  short time; your father followed with remarks. I then arose, and had spoken but a few words, when I felt my strength renewed; all my feebleness seemed to leave me, and I spoke about one hour with perfect freedom. I felt inexpressible gratitude for this help from God at the very time when I so much needed it. On Wednesday evening I spoke with freedom nearly two hours upon the health and dress reforms. To have my strength so unexpectedly renewed, when I had felt completely exhausted before these two meetings, has been a source of great encouragement to me.",
