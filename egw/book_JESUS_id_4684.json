{"word": "The physical constitution of Jesus, as well as His spiritual development, is brought before us in these words, \"the child grew,\" and \"increased in stature.\" In childhood and youth attention should be given to physical development. Parents should so train their children in good habits of eating and drinking, dressing, and exercise, that a good foundation will be laid for sound health in afterlife. . . . This places the children and youth in a favorable position, so that, with proper religious training, they may, like Christ, wax strong in spirit.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 275}
