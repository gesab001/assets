Because of the many calls for means, it seems a difficult matter to secure sufficient money or to arouse an interest great enough to build a small, convenient schoolhouse. I have told the school committee that I would lease to them some land for as long a time as they care to use it for school purposes.

We expect to train a little army of workers on this hillside.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 315}
