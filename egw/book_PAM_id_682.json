{"word": "When there is harmonious action among members, there will be proportionate power in their work.--The success of our work depends upon our love to God and our love to our fellowmen. When there is harmonious action among the individual members of the church, when there is love and confidence manifested by brother to brother, there will be proportionate force and power in our work for the salvation of men. Oh, how greatly we need a moral renovation! Without the faith that works by love, you can do nothing. May the Lord give you hearts to receive this testimony.--TM 188.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 269}
