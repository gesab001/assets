{"word": "From any one who persists in stubbornness and self-will, God will remove His spirit, and another will wear the crown that was for him. God accepts only those who will learn of Christ, those who study His Word, learning lessons of meekness and lowliness of heart, lessons of obedience, willingness to do his work in God's way, not their finite way. The work that is wrought in God will bear the credentials of heaven, and will show marked results. Personal views should be kept subordinate in the work of God; you must in all things put Christ foremost. To present the truth as it is in Jesus, is a work as enduring as eternity. The work coming forth as a perfect whole from the hands of various workmen, each acting his part, will bring the commendation of the Captain of our salvation. You have a work to do, and it is not best to keep ever before the mind the difficulties and the impossibilities. Say continually, \\93Through Jesus Christ who strengtheneth us, we can do this work.\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 24}
