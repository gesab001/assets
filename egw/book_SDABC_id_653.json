    "word": "The lessons to be learned from the life work of Elijah and Elisha mean much to all who are striving to plant the feet of men and women on the eternal Rock.

The presentation of the truth must be made with grace and with power to those who stand in need of light and uplifting (Letter 30, 1912).",
