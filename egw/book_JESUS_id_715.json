{"word": "The words from heaven, \\93This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,\\94 were still sounding in the ears of Satan. But he was determined to make Christ disbelieve this testimony. The word of God was Christ\\92s assurance of His divine mission. . . . It was Satan\\92s purpose to make Him doubt this word. If Christ\\92s confidence in God could be shaken, Satan knew that victory in the whole conflict would be his. He could overcome Jesus. He hoped that under the force of despondency and extreme hunger, Christ would lose faith in His Father and work a miracle in His own behalf. Had He done this, the plan of salvation would have been broken.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 190}
