{"word": "The Need Of Caution \n\n     There is at the present time great need of caution. \"Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.\" James 1:19. Let us heed the warning: \"I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, . . . and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.\" Romans 16:17-19.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "8T", "page": 167}
