    "word": "\\n     Because of the example set by the school in Battle Creek, the same mistake has been made by our school in Cooranbong. Students have been admitted to the school at so low a figure that the school has not paid expenses. This is not right. When managers of a school see that the school is running behind, let them call a halt. Let them go to the people, and tell them the situation. It costs too much to incur debt. Not only the debt, but the interest on the debt must be paid. This places a tremendous load upon the teachers and managers. How much better it would be to raise the tuition. How much better it would be to let a family here and a family there pay a little more than to place the tuition so low that the school is placed under the burden of debt.",
