    "word": "\\n     It was sincere devotion and humble, earnest prayer that brought the disciples into close communion with Christ. They sat together with Him in heavenly places. They realized the greatness of their debt to Him. Should we be less earnest than they were? Shall we not by living faith claim the promises which moved them to the depths of their being to call upon the Lord Jesus for the fulfillment of the word, \\\"Ask, and ye shall receive?\\\" Is not the Spirit of God to come today in answer to persevering prayer, and fill men with power? Is the throne of grace farther removed from us than it was from the disciples? Is not God saying to His praying, trusting, believing workers, who are opening the Scriptures to those ignorant of the precious truths they contain, \\\"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\\\"? Shall we not, through the indications of God's providence, hear His voice, saying, \\\"Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.\\\" There certainly are men that the Lord is fitting to stand in their lot and in their place.",
