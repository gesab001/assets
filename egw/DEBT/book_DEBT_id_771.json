    "word": "Now when the wise heads officiating in our schools study to run the school upon a sum wholly, insufficient, year after year, they are engaged in a work that will bring debts. It cannot be prevented. They have begun this policy at Cooranbong [Avondale College], and the very same results will follow. There is no justice, or requirement of God, for them to make such loose calculations. They make it necessary to practice the closest economy and it is not always wise to bring down the diet as a means of avoiding debts. Economy must be practiced in every line to keep afloat and not be drowned with debts; but there is to be an increase in the sum paid for tuition.--Letter 137, 1898, p. 11. (To Brethren Irwin, Evans, Smith, and Jones, April 21, 1898.)",
