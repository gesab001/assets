    "word": "\"The idea that a sanitarium should not be established unless it could be started free from debt, has put the brakes upon the wheels of progress. In building meeting houses, I have had to borrow money, in order that something might be done at once, I have been obliged to do this, in order to fulfill the direction of God. For the past twenty years I have been (43) borrowing money and paying interest on it, to establish schools and sanitariums and to build meeting houses. The institutions thus established and the churches built have been the means of bringing many to the truth. Thus the tithe has been increased, and workers been added to the Lord's forces.",
