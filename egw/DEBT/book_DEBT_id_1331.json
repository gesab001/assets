    "word": "\\n     For every service we perform, the Lord has pledged His word to reward us, not because it is a debt He owes us, but because His heart is full of love, full of mercy and tenderness. He promises to repay us a hundred-fold in this life, and in the world to come give us life everlasting. But how many there are who spend their days in gloom and discouragement, looking at the dark side of their experience, forgetting that angels of heaven are waiting to cooperate with them, waiting to make them channels of blessing to the world.",
