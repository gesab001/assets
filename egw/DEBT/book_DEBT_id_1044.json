    "word": "\\n     This life is a training school, where we are to be transformed, refined, and made meet for the society of saints in the kingdom of God, with whom we expect to associate throughout the ages of eternity. Let Christ's righteousness, the righteousness of the law of God, be the standard, and let the Christian's prayer be, \\\"Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.\\\" The world will soil the soul every day unless the cleansing blood is our reliance. Every thought is to be brought into captivity to Christ; every angry word is to be left unspoken. There must be no deception; selfishness or carelessness is a deviation from right. God's law should be the rule in all business transactions. This will lead to the payment of debts, that the character of God may be rightly represented. Truly \\\"the commandment is exceeding broad,\\\" reaching to every thought and act of the life. \\n                                                                -\\n",
