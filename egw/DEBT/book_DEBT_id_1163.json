    "word": "\\n     Let those who have been expending means and time and thought on needless decoration of themselves, face the mirror of God's law and behold their real defects. Do not make excuses, but pray as did David, \\\"Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.\\\" If the money used in multiplying pictures of yourselves were devoted to the cause of God, if means expended for mere selfish gratification were turned into the channel that flows to the treasury, our missionaries would be well supplied with the necessaries of life, our publishing houses would not be burdened with debt, and the treasury would be full and running over. Complaints would not be heard concerning our inability to extend our missionary operations.",
