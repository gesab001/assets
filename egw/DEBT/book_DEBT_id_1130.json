    "word": "\\n     God holds us as his debtors, and also as debtors to our fellow-men who have not the light and truth. Said Paul, \\\"I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.\\\" God had revealed to Paul his truth, and in so doing made him a debtor to those who were in darkness, to enlighten them. God has given us light, not to hide under a bushel, but to set on a candlestick, that all who are in the house may be benefited. Our light should shine to others to reveal to them the way of everlasting life.",
