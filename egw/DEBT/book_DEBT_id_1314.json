    "word": "\\n     It is the high privilege of the sons and daughters of God to go forth and present to others the truth as it is in Jesus; for we are to watch and to seek for souls as they that must give an account. We are to feel a constant sense of our indebtedness to God for the gift of his Son, and be ever watching for opportunities to enlist others in the army of the Lord. It is not he that enjoyeth righteousness, but he that doeth righteousness, that is righteous. Jesus said, \\\"Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.\\\" The doing of the will of God is a result of possessing the faith that works by love and purifies the soul.",
