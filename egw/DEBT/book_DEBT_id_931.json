    "word": "A mistake was made in the methods that were adopted to clear the schools in Calif. from debt. The book \"Christ's Object Lessons\" was given to relieve the indebtedness of our (458) schools. But this plan has not been presented in our schools as it should have been; the students and teachers have not been educated to take hold of this book and push its sale for the benefit of the educational work. The plan that has been followed of calling on our people to support these schools must not be continued; for this is giving to our teachers and students, and to our people in general, a wrong education. They must not be so instructed that they will forget the needs of other fields outside their own.",
