    "word": "\\n     The reports presented at the conference were most encouraging. It was stated that about a year ago, there was a deficit of nearly eight thousand dollars, which has all been paid; and at the time of the meeting, there was about six thousand dollars in the treasury. The gifts to missions amounted to nearly three thousands dollars. It was further stated that the debt on the Fernando School is now twelve thousand dollars--just about half the total debt a few months ago. According to the financial report, the medical institutions in Los Angeles, including the restaurant and the Glendale Sanitarium, earned nearly nine thousand dollars during the past nine months. A large portion of this sum has been used to lessen the debts on these institutions.",
