    "word": "\\n     As did Nathan with David, Christ concealed His home thrust under the vail of a parable. He threw upon His host the burden of pronouncing sentence upon himself. This way of presenting the matter made Simon feel very uncomfortable. He himself had led into sin the woman he now despised. She had been deeply wronged by him. By the two debtors of the parable Simon and the woman are represented. Simon's sin is shown to be tenfold greater than that of the woman, as much greater as a debt of five hundred pence is greater than a debt of fifty pence.",
