    "word": "\\n\\nAugust 1, 1905 Strength for Weakness\\n\\nMrs. E. G. White\\n\\n     The Lord would have your thoughts center upon Him. For every service, every self-denial, every sacrifice we make, the Lord has guaranteed to requite us, not because it is a debt He owes us, but because His heart is full of infinite love, full of mercy and tenderness, overflowing toward us in that He will repay us a hundred fold in this life, and give us in the world to come life everlasting. The reason why so many are weak, is that they do not cultivate faith, but look at the objectionable and discouraging features. They do not consider that all the universe of heaven is waiting to become co-laborers with them, waiting to make them the living agencies to bless the world with the message God shall give them to bear.",
