    "word": "\\n     Recently I have been shown again and again that it is the angels of God who make the impression on human hearts. It is the angels of God who go before the workers. In the night season I was laboring with the problem of the relief of our schools, not knowing how to answer the letters written to me regarding the situation. I fell asleep, and the angel of God seemed to stand beside me, saying, \\\"Donate to the cause of education the book 'Christ's Object Lessons.'\\\" This so startled me that I at once awoke. And O, I was so grateful to the Lord for the light he had given me regarding what I could do to help to free our schools from debt! It was only twelve o'clock, but I could stay in bed no longer. I rose, and began writing something of what must be done. And I wish to say now that much more has been done with the book than I flattered myself could be done. I feel like shedding tears of joy when I think of what God has permitted me to do for the schools.",
