    "word": "\\n     We must never allow ourselves to doubt the love of Jesus,--he who for our sake bore the contradiction of sinners against himself. He was buffeted with temptations, convulsed with agony, lacerated with stripes, pierced by nails, crowned with thorns; and he consented to all this humiliation and suffering that he might gain for us the victory over Satan. He exposed himself to abuse and insult for our sake. Every arrow with which Satan pierced him, every pang of anguish that he endured, was in our behalf. His life was one dark series of afflictions, which weakened at every step Satan's hold upon humanity. Thus he paid the debt which man owed to God, and brought us out of the bondage of Satan into the marvelous light of the gospel.",
