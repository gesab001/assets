    "word": "I am not permitted to say, Dispose of the Colorado Sanitarium. This institution was established by our people for a special work. It has the right of way. The Lord requires equity and sound judgment to be exercised in all such matters. Let every effort be made to lift the debt resting on this institution. It is not by selling the sanitarium that the situation is to be relieved, but by paying the debt.",
