    "word": "The Bible is our Counsellor. We are educating students in the Scriptures. Every day we are seeking the Lord for wisdom. Debts must not be allowed to accumulate. We must have help with which to carry on our school. It will be so much better to make donations now, \n\n\n                                   -131- \n\nto lessen the principal, thus lessening the interest to be paid. A great work is to be done to give these precious souls, God's heritage, a true education, that they may reach the higher grade, and the heavenly family in the paradise of God, sons and daughters of the King. We are making the Word of God our study. We can not depend upon lesson books that breathe the breath of infidelity. Oh, how much we have lost by making the Word of the living God secondary! The writings of human inventions, human authors, whose sentiments are opposed to God, are as tares sown among wheat.",
