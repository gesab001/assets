    "word": "Dear brethren, \u201cexamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith.\u201d [2 Corinthians 13:5.] Many may respond, \u201cWhy, yes, I am in the faith; I believe every point of the truth.\u201d But do you practice what you believe? Are you at peace with God and with your brethren? Can you pray with sincerity, \u201cForgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors\u201d? [Matthew 6:12.] Or are you estranged from your brother, because you think he has injured you? Are there no heart-burnings among you? Is there no bitterness in your hearts, no envying, no jealousy, no evil surmising, no misjudging of your brethren? Is there no emulation, no desire for special favor or honors, no wish to have the supremacy? These feelings should not exist among Christians.",
