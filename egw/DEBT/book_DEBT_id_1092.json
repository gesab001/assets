    "word": "\\n     Many of the servants of Christ, although constantly reminded, seem to forget that they are stewards of their Lord's goods. I have been shown that many of them have become rusty from inaction. The Lord, in His providence, has now given them something to do, and has thus opened the way for them to help others to become acquainted with the special truths for this time. He has given them a work to do that will bring a great and grand result. In getting out of the easy chair of self-satisfaction, and going forth to give the light of truth to their fellow-men, they will learn an excellent lesson. By selling \\\"Object Lessons\\\" they are doing a two-fold work--helping to lift the debt from our schools, and at the same time giving the precious light of truth to those who need it.",
