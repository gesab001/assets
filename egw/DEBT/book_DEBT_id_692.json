It is his purpose that we so educate the mind as to enable us to bring into exercise the talents he has given us in such a manner as will accomplish the greatest good, and reflect back the glory to the Giver. We are indebted to God for all the qualities of the mind. These powers can be cultivated, and so discreetly directed and controlled as to accomplish the purpose for which God gave them.",
