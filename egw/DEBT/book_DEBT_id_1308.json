    "word": "\\n     The Father was revealed in Christ as altogether a different being from that which Satan had represented him to be. Said Christ, \\\"Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\\\" The love of Jesus, expressed for the fallen race in his life of self-denial and sufferings, is the manifestation of the Father's love for a sinful, fallen world. Christ endured shame and grief and death for those who despised his love and trampled upon his mercy. He paid the debt of man's transgression upon the cross of Calvary with his own precious blood. The men of his own nation, the leaders of the people, were so ensnared by the deceptions of Satan that the plan of redemption for a fallen race seemed to their minds indistinct and unexplainable.",
