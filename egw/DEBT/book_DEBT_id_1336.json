    "word": "\\n     From every one God requires perfect obedience. Of himself, man can not obey the law. Never could he pay the debt incurred by transgression. Christ came to this world to bring man power to obey. He came in human nature that He might know the temptations and trials to which man is subjected. He who accepts Christ as a personal Saviour will receive divine aid in the struggle against sin. Through the merits of the Saviour, he will become an obedient subject of God's kingdom. In the strength of Christ he will overcome every temptation of the enemy.",
