    "word": "\\n     When we come to ask mercy and blessing from God, we should have a spirit of love and forgiveness in our own hearts. How can we pray, \\\"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,\\\" and yet indulge an unforgiving spirit? If we expect our own prayers to be heard, we must forgive others in the same manner, and to the same extent, as we hope to be forgiven.",
