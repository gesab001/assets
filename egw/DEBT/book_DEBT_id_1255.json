    "word": "\\n     ARRIVING IN PHILADELPHIA, WE WERE MET BY ELDER W. H. HECKMAN, AND TAKEN TO THE PENNSYLVANIA SANITARIUM. THIS INSTITUTION IS OWNED AND LOYALLY SUPPORTED BY THE EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA CONFERENCE. IT IS HOUSED IN AN EXCELLENT BUILDING; IT IS WELL MANAGED, AND HAS AN ABLE CORPS OF PHYSICIANS AND NURSES. IT ENJOYS A LIBERAL PATRONAGE FROM THE CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA, BUT ITS LOCATION (WHERE THE NOISE OF STREET-CARS REACHES IT) AND ITS LIMITED CAPACITY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE INSTITUTION TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT WAS AT FIRST EXPECTED OF IT,--TO PAY ALL EXPENSES, TO PAY INTEREST ON THE INVESTMENT, AND TO CLEAR AWAY THE DEBT.",
