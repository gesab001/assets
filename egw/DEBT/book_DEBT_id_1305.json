    "word": "\\n     In view of what Christ has done and is doing for the children of men, should we not bring gratitude offerings to him? Should our gifts flow only to one another, and the Giver of every good and perfect gift be forgotten? The Lord has said, \\\"Them that honor me, I will honor.\\\" We should not wait to make an offering to God until we are out of debt. His cause demands the means that he has given to us in trust, and we should present a portion on the altar of God as freely as the infinite sacrifice was made for us. We have no time to lose in passing our treasures on to the bank of heaven. Whatever we may do, let us not forget God. If we love him with all the heart, we shall remember his claims upon us. God requires that we shall be like him, that we shall imitate the self-sacrificing example of Christ, and live a life of self-denial. We should prayerfully consider the question, \\\"How much owest thou unto the Lord?\\\"",
