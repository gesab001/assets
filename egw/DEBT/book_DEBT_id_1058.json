    "word": "\\n     There is great need of sanctified judgment in order that the work of God shall advance to occupy the many fields that are opening for its entrance. A large work is to be carried forward in our world, and in no one place should there be a large expenditure of means and ability, when it will cut off the building up of interests that are equally important. In all the work of building our institutions, the superscription of the Master should be seen, and not the mold of man. It is a mistake for an enterprise of this character to be carried forward in such a way that a large debt is accumulated. The managers of these interests greatly need the endowment of the Holy Spirit, in order that through the influence of ambition they may not be led to do some great thing, and swallow up a great proportion of the means that should be more widely distributed. It is not in God's order that one interest should be strengthened while another is left to languish and die.",
