    "word": "\\n \\n                      The Spirit of Christ. \\n\\n     The character of the mission of Christ is delineated in the words of Isaiah which we have quoted. He did not come to minister simply to the highest grade of society. The Lord pitied those who felt their need of a Saviour, and those who are touched with the Spirit of Christ, if they have had better opportunities than others for cultivation, for refinement and nobility of character, will feel that they are debtors to those who have been less favorably situated, and they will minister as far as possible of their benefits to those who are wanting in these things. God has given this manner of work to his elect people. They are to reveal to the world that they are disciples of the greatest Teacher the world ever knew, and that they are working along the same lines as he worked. They are to open their treasures to those who need them, and this will bring them in contact with the very ones who appreciated the labors of Christ; for we read that the common people heard him gladly. Their hearts were not engrossed with the things of the world, and they could discern the things of eternal value. Those who are in high positions, who are intrusted with rich capabilities, are likely to worship themselves, to make themselves a center, to indulge themselves in intemperate desires, to fear to give back to God his own, and to neglect the example of Christ, who took upon himself the garb of humanity, in order that he might reach and lift humanity by his divine influence.",
