    "word": "\\n     My brethren and sisters, let us all take part in sharing the burden of this College debt. The Review and Herald needs the portion that is due to it. I entreat you not to find fault. Many sacrifices have been made by those who have striven to lessen this debt. I ask you to show a decided and practical interest in this matter. If all enter heartily into the plan of raising money to cancel this debt by means of the Missionary Acre Fund, it will soon be swept away, and relief will be brought to many who are carrying heavy burdens.",
