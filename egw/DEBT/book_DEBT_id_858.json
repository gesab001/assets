    "word": "The Lord does not want anyone to be unhappy. My brother, your case is not hopeless. With regard to the colporteur wagon, cannot you go to the church officers and get them to buy it from you? Then with this money you can pay your debts, and for a year, if need be, work out of doors, not touching a piano. Leave the business which makes you nervous and restless. When you have done all you can, trust in God. Get out of debt, and never again get into debt. Live so economically that you will not have to feel the galling burden of debt.",
