    "word": "\\n     Our camp-meeting closed free from debt. Economy has been exercised in all the arrangements, and by earnest effort, sufficient means has been raised to meet expenditures; so there will be no debt from this source to burden the hearts of the workers for the coming year. And a hundred pounds has been pledged for the new Sydney Sanitarium. This is a good donation to come from the little company of believers assembled at this meeting. They have done what they could.",
