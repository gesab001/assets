    "word": "\\n     Are there those who are robbing God in tithes and offerings? Seek to make your accounts straight; do not leave your obligation to God as the last thing to be settled. Let those who have borrowed, try to pay their debts; especially see to it that no poor person who has labored hard for his means, is left in perplexity because you fail to pay what you owe him. Let no injustice be done to your neighbors, but let everything be made right as far as possible between you and your fellow-men. This is keeping the last six commandments.",
