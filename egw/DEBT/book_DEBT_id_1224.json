    "word": "\\n     About the time of the General Conference in 1901, the way opened for the sale of the Battle Creek College property; and the understanding was that the buildings and grounds would be used for the American Medical Missionary College, and that our people everywhere should be asked to contribute for the clearing of the debt. In the councils of our brethren, it was arranged that this be raised from the proceeds of the Missionary Acre Fund. It was thought that our people throughout America who had land, could set apart a small portion of it for the Lord, and send the proceeds to the general treasury, to be applied in the payment of the College debts, and the clearing of the property for the use of the American Medical Missionary College. It was suggested that those who had no land to use, might give of their earnings, and that in various other ways persons disposed to help could contribute of their substance. Our brethren felt sure that if our people everywhere would give liberally of the fruit of their toil, a large sum could soon be raised, and the debt quickly canceled.",
