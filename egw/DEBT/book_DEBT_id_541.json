    "word": "The infinite sacrifice which Christ has made to magnify and exalt the law testifies that not one jot or tittle of that law will relinquish its claims upon the transgressor. Christ came to pay the debt which the sinner had incurred by transgression and by His own example to teach man how to keep the law of God. Said Christ, \"I have kept my Father's commandments\" (John 15:10). . . . It is inconceivable how so many, professing to be servants of God, can set aside His law and teach sinners that they are not amenable to its precepts. What a fatal delusion!. . . .",
