    "word": "\\n\\nMay 19, 1910 The Duty of Forgiveness\\n\\nMrs. E. G. White\\n\\n     \\\"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,\\\" Christ taught us to pray. But it is most difficult even for those who claim to be followers of Jesus, to forgive as he forgave us. The true spirit of forgiveness is so little practised, and so many interpretations are placed upon Christ's requirement, that its force and beauty are lost sight of. We have very uncertain views of the great mercy and loving-kindness of God. He is full of compassion and forgiveness, and freely pardons when we truly repent and confess our sins. But when the message of God's pardoning love comes from a heart that has an experimental knowledge of it, to those who have not experienced it for themselves, it is like speaking in parables. We must bring into our characters the love and sympathy expressed in Christ's life.",
