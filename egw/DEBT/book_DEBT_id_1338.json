    "word": "\\n     \\\"And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.\\\" Few realize the true import of these words. After completing the Lord's Prayer, as given in the sixth chapter of Matthew, Jesus added, \\\"If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\\\" He who is unforgiving cuts off the very channel through which alone he can receive mercy from God. However sorely we may have been wounded, we are not to cherish our grievances, and sympathize with ourselves over our injuries; but as we hope to be pardoned for our offenses against God, we are to pardon all who have done evil to us.",
