    "word": "Years ago light was given me in regard to the establishment of sanitariums. It is not after the Lord's mind to have sanitariums multiply too rapidly. It is not His plan for an institution to be in too close proximity to another one doing the same kind of work; for an institution, wherever it may be, must have good facilities and experienced helpers. With it should be connected capable, God-fearing managers--men who are sound in the faith, who will exert an influence for good, and who are able to carry the heavy responsibilities entrusted to them without running behind and involving the institutions in debt.",
