    "word": "\\n\\nDecember 19, 1901 The Keeping of Records\\n\\n     Our people do not half appreciate the importance of having the records of our institutions properly kept. When records are properly kept, they are a great help in keeping institutions, as well as private individuals, out of debt. Correct bookkeeping is a matter of no little consequence. There has been altogether too much blundering in the matter of keeping accounts. The books in some of our institutions have at times been kept by those who were not thorough, practical bookkeepers. Many have entered upon their work without receiving the education essential in order to be able to keep books correctly. More than once when the records have been given entirely into the charge of these inexperienced bookkeepers, they have so confused the accounts that financial loss has resulted to the institution, and even greater disaster to the accountants themselves; for their honesty has been questioned and their influence hurt.",
