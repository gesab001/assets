    "word": "\\n     The opportunity we have of doing good by striving to carry out the Lord's plan for the relief of our schools and sanitariums, has been presented to me over and over again in connection with the Southern California Conference. The conditions there are unusually favorable for a long-continued effort to push the sale of \\\"Christ's Object Lessons\\\" and \\\"Ministry of Healing.\\\" Our brethren and sisters in Southern California should never weary of this plan for raising money to meet the debts that have accumulated. The students of the Fernando School, and the nurses of the three sanitariums that have been established, can ill afford to lose the precious experiences in missionary work that come to those who handle the relief books. And the conference can ill afford to lose the results, spiritual as well as financial, that would accompany a continued effort of this sort.",
