    "word": "\\n     Today let the question come home to the heart of every one who professes the name of Christ, \\\"Dost thou believe in the Son of God?\\\" Not, \\\"Do you admit that Jesus is the Redeemer of the world?\\\" Not to soothe your conscience and the consciences of others by saying, \\\"I believe,\\\" and think that is all there is to be done. But do you believe with all your heart that Jesus is your Saviour? Do you bring him into your life, and weave him into your character, until you are one with Christ? Many accept Jesus as an article of belief, but they have no saving faith in him as their sacrifice and Saviour. They have no realization that Christ has died to save them from the penalty of the law which they have transgressed, in order that they may be brought back to loyalty to God. Do you believe that Christ, as your substitute, pays the debt of your transgression? Not, however, that you may continue in sin, but that you may be saved from your sins; that you, through the merits of his righteousness, may be re-instated to the favor of God. Do you know that a holy and just God will accept your efforts to keep his law, through the merits of his own beloved Son who died for your rebellion and sin?",
