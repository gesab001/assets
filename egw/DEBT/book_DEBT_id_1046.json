    "word": "\\n     The humanity of Christ reached to the very depths of human wretchedness, and identified itself with the weaknesses and necessities of fallen man; while His divine nature grasped the Eternal. His work, in bearing the guilt of man's transgression, was not to give him license to continue to violate the law of God; for transgression made man a debtor to the law, and Christ Himself was paying this debt by His own suffering. The trials and sufferings of Christ were to impress man with a sense of his great sin in breaking the law of God, and to bring him to repentance and obedience to that law, and through obedience to acceptance with God. He would impute His righteousness to man, and so raise him in moral value with God that his efforts to keep the divine law would be acceptable.",
