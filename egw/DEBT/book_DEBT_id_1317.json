    "word": "\\n     When the unjust steward whose great debt had been forgiven met another inferior to him in position, who owed him but a small sum, he was filled with anger, and with threats and violence claimed the money that was due him. When the poor debtor fell at his feet, and used the very same prayer which he himself had uttered before his lord, he was merciless. He accused the man of an intention of not paying him, and disregarded his prayers and tears. He who had been forgiven so much, would himself forgive nothing. He claimed his right, and, taking advantage of the law, afflicted the distressed debtor by casting him into prison. This conduct grieved those who witnessed it, for they knew the whole story of his pardon, and they carried a report of his doings to the king. Then the king's anger was stirred, and he ordered the man to come before him. \\\"Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me; shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.\\\"",
