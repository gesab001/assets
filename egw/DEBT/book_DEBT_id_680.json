    "word": "The Proceeds from \"Christ's Object Lessons\" to be \n      Used for Emmanuel Missionary College \n\n\n     \"I have something to write in regard to the school interest. 'Christ's Object Lessons,' in accordance with the Lord's instructions, was donated to our schools for the special purpose of releasing them from debt. And this gave the Review & Herald Publishing Co. opportunity to do a generous work in behalf of the Battle Creek school. If the work of selling 'Christ's Object Lessons' had not been taken up, there would scarcely have been a hope that the debt of the Battle Creek College to the Review office would ever have been paid. From the light given me by the Lord, I know that he will be displeased if the Review & Herald Publishing Co. is in any way exacting with those trying to release our schools from debt. As those in the Review & Herald Publishing Co., see our brethren struggling to free the schools from debt, they are to co-operate with them. Those who have charge of this work have carried a heavy burden.\"",
