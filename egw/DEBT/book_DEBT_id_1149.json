    "word": "\\n     Is there not occasion for humility? Is there not need of feeling our utter dependence upon Christ every day and hour? Have we not walked in the ways of our own choosing, and have we not found in this path only failure? We have \\\"sinned, and come short of the glory of God,\\\" and in order to save man, Jesus made an infinite sacrifice. Nothing less than the life of God's beloved Son would suffice to pay the heavy debt that we had incurred by breaking the law of God. He took on him our nature, and became sin for us, that we might have \\\"remission of sins that are past,\\\" and through his divine strength and grace, might fulfill the righteous requirements of the law. Whoever takes the position that it makes no difference whether or not we keep the commandments of God, is not acquainted with Christ. Jesus says, \\\"I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love;\\\" and those who follow Jesus will do as he has done. The beloved disciple writes, \\\"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.\\\" We cannot abide in the love of our Saviour, if we trample under foot any part of that law which he came to \\\"magnify\\\" and make \\\"honorable,\\\" even to the cost of suffering the humiliation and death of the cross.",
