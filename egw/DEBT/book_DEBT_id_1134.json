    "word": "\\n     Dear brethren, \\\"examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith.\\\" Many present may immediately respond, \\\"Why, yes; I am in the faith, I believe every point of the truth.\\\" But do you practice what you believe? Are you at peace with God and with your brethren? Can you pray with sincerity,\\\" Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors? or are you estranged from your brother, because you suppose he has injured you? Are there no heartburnings among you? Is there no bitterness in your hearts, no envying, no jealousy, no evil surmising, no misjudging of your brethren? Is there no emulation, no desire for special favor and honors, no wish to have the supremacy? These feelings do exist to a greater or less degree among brethren.",
