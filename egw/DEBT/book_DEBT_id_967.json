    "word": "This letter from Brother Burden I received one Friday afternoon. I asked W. C. White to telegraph immediately to Brother Burden that he should by all means secure the property. Some of our brethren connected with the Conference advised otherwise, fearing that the Conference would be more deeply involved in debt. But I followed my telegram with a letter, saying distinctly that the place should be purchased without delay. I considered that the advantages of this location authorized me to speak positively regarding this matter. I said, There is sufficient money in the hands of God's people, and if we seek the Lord, He will make their hearts willing to help in this time of need.",
