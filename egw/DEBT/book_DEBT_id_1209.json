    "word": "\\n     About two years ago, when I was asked what could be done to relieve our schools from debt, I laid the matter before the Lord, and there came to me the thought that I could give the book, \\\"Christ's Object Lessons,\\\" to the schools. Then came another thought, \\\"I have depended on this book to pay my workers, and I must be just before I am generous.\\\" In the night season I was considering the problem of my finances. I desired to save money to pay my debts, that I might be free from the burden of interest. But I could see no other way for the schools to be relieved than for me to give \\\"Christ's Object Lessons\\\" for this purpose, and I said, \\\"It must be done.\\\" Then the conflict ended. Light filled my mind. I began at once to write to our publishing houses, asking them if they would not share the gift with me by giving the work that must be done in the publication of the book.",
