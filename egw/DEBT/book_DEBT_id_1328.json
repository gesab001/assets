    "word": "\\n     \\\"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love,\\\" writes Paul, \\\"in honor preferring one another.\\\" \\\"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ be in you, except ye be reprobate.\\\" \\\"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.\\\" \\\"If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.\\\" \\\"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\\\"",
