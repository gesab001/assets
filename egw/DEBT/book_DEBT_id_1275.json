THERE IS A DEBT OF $8,000 ON IT AT PRESENT, AND THERE IS NOT THE REMOTEST PROSPECT OF THE OAKLAND CHURCH, IF LEFT TO ITSELF, EVER PAYING THE DEBT. THE CHURCH IS POOR AND, STRUGGLE AS IT MAY, CAN HARDLY PAY INTEREST AND RUNNING EXPENSES, WHICH AMOUNT TO $1,200 A YEAR. THERE ARE ONLY TWO OR THREE IN THE CHURCH WHO ARE WORTH ANYTHING AT ALL, AND THEY PAY THE LEAST.",
