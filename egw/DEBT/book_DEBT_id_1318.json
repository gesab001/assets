    "word": "\\n     Will not those whose names are upon the church books, who claim to be the sons and daughters of God, consider their relation to God and their fellow-men? We must depend entirely upon the mercy of a sin-pardoning Saviour, and shall we allow our hearts to remain hard and unsympathizing? Can any provocation authorize us to cherish unkind feelings, or cause us to harbor ill feelings or seek revenge? Can we cast the first stone in condemnation of a brother, when God is extending his mercy toward us, and forgiving our trespasses against him? Should God enter into judgment with us our debt would be found to be immense, yet our heavenly Father is willing to forgive. Men will be dealt with by God not according to their opinion of themselves, not according to their self-confidence, but according to the spirit which they reveal toward their erring brethren.",
