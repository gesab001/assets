    "word": "\\n     When the book, \\\"Christ's Object Lessons,\\\" was given for the relief of the schools, those who were connected with Battle Creek College worked very earnestly to carry out the plan for reducing the indebtedness on our educational institutions. They hoped that they might be able so to lessen the debt on their own school that they could feel free to leave Battle Creek, and to reopen the College in some place where they could more fully follow out the Lord's instruction in regard to Christian education.",
