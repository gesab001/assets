    "word": "\\n     Our offerings are not accepted of God unless they are presented in a spirit of reverence and gratitude. It is the humble, grateful, reverential heart that makes all offerings as a sweet-smelling savor. The children of Israel might have given all their substance; but had it been given in a spirit of self-sufficiency or pharisaism, with the feeling that God was indebted to them, and for this reason had bestowed upon them the favors they had received at His hand, their offerings would have been rejected, utterly contemned of God.",
