    "word": "\\n\\nApril 21, 1885 Praise Due to the Creator.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     God is love. He has a care for the creatures he has formed. \\\"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.\\\" He has not designed that his creatures should be miserable. Have any of us duly considered how much we have to be thankful for? Do we remember that the mercies of the Lord are new every morning, and that his faithfulness faileth not? Do we acknowledge our dependence upon him, and express gratitude for all his favors? On the contrary, we too often forget that \\\"every good and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.\\\" Many experience needless unhappiness. They take their minds from Jesus, and center them too much upon self. They magnify small difficulties, and talk discouragements. They are guilty of the great sin of needless repining over God's providences. For all that we have and are, we are indebted to God. He has given us powers, that, to a certain extent, are similar to those which he himself possesses; and we should labor earnestly to develop these powers, not to please and exalt self, but to glorify him.",
