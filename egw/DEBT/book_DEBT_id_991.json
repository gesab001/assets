    "word": "Light has been given me that we are not to pattern after any school that has been run in America. There is to be a more durable education gained. It is the knowledge of the Word. And with every arrangement made, economy must be kept in view. The teachers must cooperate in requiring from the students sufficient funds to cover the running expenses or they must themselves agree to do their work for lower wages. The estimate of the school expenses must be considered, and if there is no way to keep free from debt, all are at liberty to arrange among themselves to donate a certain amount of their wages. It may be best to raise the tuition; then the teachers will have the privilege of using their means to help where they see that help is most needed. When a call is made for means, where it is a pleasure to assist, the teachers should have something in their own earnings to use as they shall see fit.",
