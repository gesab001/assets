    "word": "\\n     One who is not acquainted with the intricacies of the business should not be left to deal with the records unaided. His work should often be examined by an experienced and accurate accountant. Let no bookkeeper be left to follow his own ideas, without counsel from others. At stated periods the account books in every conference, society, and every institution connected with our cause should be carefully examined. Let some one be appointed for the work, a person of experience, who is able to judge properly of the business done. If the records of our institutions are properly kept and carefully examined, they will show when debts are being contracted that may be difficult to pay. The cause of the institution not being self-supporting will readily appear. Then steps can, at once, be taken to prevent loss, so as to save the disaster and disgrace of an accumulating debt.",
