    "word": "\\n     We must forgive those who trespass against us, if we would obtain pardon and grace when we approach the mercy-seat. Mercy and love must be cherished by all who would be followers of Jesus. When Peter asked, \\\"Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?\\\" Jesus replied, \\\"I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but Until seventy times seven.\\\" He then enforced the duty of forgiveness, by the parable of the two debtors. One was forgiven a debt of ten thousand talents, and then refused to show mercy to his fellow-servant who owed him a hundred pence. The pardon granted to that hard-hearted servant was revoked, and he was delivered to the tormentors. Our Lord makes the application of the parable in these impressive words: \\\"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\\\"",
