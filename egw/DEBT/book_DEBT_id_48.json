    "word": "Not to Incur Debt\nAll must practice economy. No worker should manage his affairs in a way to incur debt. The practice of drawing money from the treasury before it is earned, is a snare.

When one voluntarily becomes involved in debt, he is entangling himself in one of Satan's nets which he sets for souls.\u2014Manual for Canvassers, page 65.",
