    "word": "\\n     \\\"Forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.\\\" We can not repeat this prayer from the heart, and dare be unforgiving; for we ask the Lord to forgive our trespasses against him as we forgive those who trespass against us. Very few realize the true import of this prayer. If those who are unforgiving comprehended the depth of its meaning, they would not dare repeat it, and ask God to deal with them as they deal with their fellow mortals.",
