    "word": "\\n     In what sense was Paul debtor both to the Jew and to the Greek? To him, as to every disciple of Christ, had been given the commission, \\\"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\\\" In accepting Christ, Paul accepted this commission. He realized that upon him rested the obligation of laboring for all classes of men,--for Jew and Gentile, for learned and unlearned, for those occupying high positions and for those in the most lowly walks of life. From a zealous persecutor of the followers of Christ, Paul became one of the Saviour's most devoted and effective workers. Suddenly arrested in his career of persecution, he was given a view of the Saviour, and a complete transformation took place in him. Henceforth his life was wholly devoted to the crucified One.",
