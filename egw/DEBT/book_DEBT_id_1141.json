    "word": "\\n     Our missionary workers must learn to economize. The largest reservoir, though fed by abundant and living springs, will fail to supply the demand if there are leakages which drain off the supply. It must not be left for one man to decide whether a certain field will warrant large efforts. If the workers in one field so fashion the work as to incur large expenses, they are barring the way so that other important fields,--fields which would warrant the outlay,-- cannot be entered. Our younger laborers must be content to work their way among the people slowly and surely, under the advice of those more experienced in the work. The ideas of many are too high. A more humble manner of working would show good results. It is encouraging to see the young entering the missionary field, and enlisting all their ardor and zeal in the work; but they must not be left to manage for themselves, and keep the cause of God weighed down with debt. Large vessels must not be intrusted to inexperienced hands to guide, lest they be wrecked. All should strive by wise management and earnest labor to gather enough to pay their own expenses. They should labor to make the cause self-sustaining, and should teach the people to rely upon themselves.",
