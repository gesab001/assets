    "word": "\\n     The law of God, the foundation of his government in Heaven and upon earth, had been broken; but could not the life of an angel pay the debt? No. That holy law was as sacred as God himself. Not one precept could be changed to meet man in his fallen condition; but the Son of God, who had had a part in man's creation, could, by giving his own life, make an acceptable offering for its transgression.",
