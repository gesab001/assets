    "word": "\\n     This parable is designed to show the spirit of tenderness and compassion which man should manifest for his fellow man. The pardon of this king represents a pardon that is supernatural,--a divine forgiveness of all sin. Christ is represented by the king who, moved with compassion, forgave the debt of his servant. Man was under the condemnation of the broken law. He could not save himself; and for this reason, Christ came to this world, clothed his divinity with humanity, and gave his life, the Just for the unjust. He desired to give in his own life an example of the forbearance that man should exercise toward his fellow man.",
