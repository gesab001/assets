    "word": "\\n     My brethren and sisters, will you not enter heartily into the carrying out of the plan that has been laid to raise means for the payment of the College debt? The Lord will greatly bless you as you do this. When this debt is paid, those in charge of the Berrien Springs school will be free to carry forward their work as the Lord designs it to be carried forward. Buildings are needed there that ought to have been erected a year ago. These buildings should go up at once, in order that the students may be made comfortable for the winter. Those at this school have been and are working at great disadvantage, because of a lack of facilities.",
