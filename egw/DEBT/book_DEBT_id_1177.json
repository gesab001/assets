    "word": "\\n\\nNovember 24, 1896 The Right Use of God's Gifts.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     The love and benevolence of God and the merciful designs of his government are proclaimed in his word. \\\"The eyes of all wait upon thee,\\\" writes the psalmist, \\\"and thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.\\\" To God we are indebted for life itself. In him \\\"we live, and move, and have our being,\\\" receiving from him \\\"life, and breath, and all things.\\\" The sun, which brings us light, and ripens that which the earth produces, is his gift. Were it not for his miracle-working power, which by day and by night causes vegetation to flourish, there would be no harvest to gather. His blessings are new every morning, and his loving care is extended to all his creatures.",
