    "word": "\\n     \\\"If the right persons are connected with the work, and if all will humble their hearts before God, although there may now be a heavy debt resting upon the institution, the Lord will work in such a way that the debt will be lessened, and souls will be converted to the truth, because they see that the workers are following in the way of the Lord, and keeping his commandments. This is the only hope for the prosperity of our sanitariums. It is useless to think of any other way. We can not expect the blessing of God to rest upon us, if we serve God at will, and let him alone at pleasure.",
