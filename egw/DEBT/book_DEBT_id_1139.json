    "word": "\\n     God holds you as his debtor, and also as debtor to your fellow-men who have not the light of present truth. He has given you light, not to be hidden under a bushel, but to be set on a candlestick that all in the house may be benefited. Your light should shine to enlighten souls for whom Christ died. The grace of God ruling in your heart, and bringing your mind and thoughts into subjection to Jesus, would make you a power on the side of Christ and the truth.",
