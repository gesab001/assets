God's Love for Us. \"He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\" Jesus took the sinner's place. He became \"sin for us, who knew no sin.\" The God of justice did not spare His Son. In the secret place of the Most High a voice was heard: \"Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.\" The whole debt for the transgressor of God's law was demanded from our Mediator. A full atonement was required. How appropriate are the words of Isaiah, \"It pleased the Lord to \n\n\n                                   -336- \n\nbruise Him; He hath put Him to grief.\" His soul was made \"an offering for sin.\" \"He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities.\"",
