    "word": "All that man has--life, the means of existence, happiness, and other blessings unnumbered that come to him day by day--is from the Father above. Man is a debtor for all he proudly claims as his own. God gives His precious gifts, that they may be used in His service. Every particle of the glory of man's success belongs to God. It is His manifold wisdom that is displayed in the works of men, and to Him belongs the praise (Youth's Instructor, Apr. 4, 1905).",
