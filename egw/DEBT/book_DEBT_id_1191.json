White.\\n-\\n     It was a serious question in the minds of the leading men of the New South Wales Conference whether we could hold a camp-meeting this year in this Conference. The meeting held last year in Stanmore was a marked success. From it the truth was sounded forth to the people of Sydney; and through the attendance of visitors from the country, the knowledge of the Sabbath and Advent message was carried to scores of towns and villages throughout the whole colony. But the expense of this meeting had left our little Conference in debt, and it was feared that we would have to forego a camp-meeting this year, for lack of funds.",
