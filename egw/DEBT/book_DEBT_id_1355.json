    "word": "\\n     Had teachers been learning the lessons the Lord would have them learn, there would not be a class of students whose bills must be settled by some one else, or they must leave college with a heavy debt hanging over them. Educators are not doing their work faithfully when they know a young man to be devoting years of his time to the study of books, not seeking to earn means to pay his own way, and yet do nothing in the matter. Every case should be investigated; every youth should be kindly inquired after, and his financial situation ascertained.",
