    "word": "\\n     In failing to co-operate with God, the church has lost her first love. Very many of God's professed people today do not love God supremely and their neighbors as themselves. The prayer of Christ for unity among his followers is not lived out. The principles that Christ carried into his life and work must be practiced. God has given dignity to men by giving his Son to save them. Christ allied himself to humanity that he might make it possible for humanity to ally itself with divine power, that man might love his fellow man with the love wherewith Christ has loved him. Christ calls upon men to exercise the same spirit of forgiveness, the same tender spirit of sympathy and love, which he has revealed for us. This is a debt that every man enlightened by the Spirit of God and converted through the truth owes to every other man with whom he comes in contact, be he friend or foe, acquaintance or stranger.",
