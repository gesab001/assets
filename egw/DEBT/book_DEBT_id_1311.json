    "word": "\\n     Christ sets in operation all good influences to oppose sin and evil. For every supposed sacrifice we make in his service, he has promised to requite us, but not as if he were in debt to man, as the magnitude of the gift shows. He has pledged his word to repay us a hundred-fold in this present life, and in the world to come to give us everlasting life. But that which to us bears the appearance of a sacrifice is not so in reality; for whatever Christ asks us to give up for his sake is only that which it would be to our injury to retain. And in its place he gives us that which is of the highest value. Every struggle against sin, every victory over evil, every holy principle exerted for God, he registers as a good work, and he who does it will be a claimant for his grace at the recompense of the just.",
