    "word": "Counsel to a Colporteur \n\n     In your letter you complain of the yoke of debt. But there is no excuse for your being in debt. . . . Your freedom in borrowing, with no reason to suppose that you will be in a position to repay it, is doing great injustice to others, robbing them of their little all, and bringing reproach upon the cause of God. If you realized what you were doing at the time of your action, you would stop. You would see the sinfulness of robbing men, believers or unbelievers, and bringing them into strait places in order to relieve your present necessities.",
