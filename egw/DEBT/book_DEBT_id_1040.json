    "word": "\\n\\nApril 1, 1901 An Important Letter.\\n-\\n\\nDear Brethren and Sisters in Australia,-- \\n     I write to arouse our church members to take a decided interest in the sale of Christ's Object Lessons, that our school may be freed from debt. Let the publishing house do what it can to defray the cost of printing the book, and let the people take hold with vigor and earnestness of the work of selling it. I am sorry that this work has been delayed. May the Lord help you to do it now, is my prayer. Cherish steady, persevering faith, faith that takes hold of the arm of infinite power.",
