    "word": "\\n\\nJuly 21, 1891 At Willis, Mich.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     In response to an urgent call from the brethren who had been laboring in Willis, Mich., I left Battle Creek April 3, in company with sister E. S. Lane, for that place. The Lord had opened the hearts of a goodly number to receive and obey the truth. A church of forty-seven members had been organized, and a neat house of worship built, which is nearly free from debt. This is, I think, the first meeting-house erected in that place. Since this was begun, the Methodists have begun a house of worship for themselves.",
