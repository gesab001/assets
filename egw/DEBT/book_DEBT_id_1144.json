    "word": "\\n\\nNovember 16, 1886 The Duty of Forgiveness.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     \\\"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\\\" It is most difficult, even for those who claim to be followers of Jesus, to forgive as Christ forgives us. The true spirit of forgiveness is so little practiced, and so many interpretations are placed upon Christ's requirement, that its force and beauty are lost sight of. We have very uncertain views of the great mercy and loving-kindness of God. He is full of compassion and forgiveness, and freely pardons when we truly repent and confess our sins. But when the message of God's pardoning love comes from a heart that has an experimental knowledge thereof, to those who have not experienced it for themselves it is like speaking in parables. We must bring into our characters the love and sympathy expressed in Christ's life.",
