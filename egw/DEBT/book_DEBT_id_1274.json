    "word": "\\n     OAKLAND, CAL., IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF ALL OUR WORK ON THE PACIFIC COAST. THERE IS LOCATED THE MOST PERFECT AND COMPLETE PUBLISHING HOUSE ON THE COAST. WE HAVE ADDED TO A FIRST-CLASS PRINTING ESTABLISHMENT, A COMPLETE BINDERY, STEREOTYPING, ELECTROTYPING, AND TYPE FOUNDRY, WHERE THE MOST IMPROVED STYLES AND QUALITIES OF THE TYPES ARE MANUFACTURED. THIS FORT MUST BE HELD AT ALL HAZARDS. WHEN WE TAKE INTO THE ACCOUNT THE YOUTH OF THE CAUSE ON THE PACIFIC COAST, ITS GROWTH IS A MARVEL. BUT THERE IS A HEAVY DEBT ON THE OAKLAND CHURCH, WHICH THAT GOOD PEOPLE CAN NEVER LIFT. THEY ARE THE POOREST AND MOST LIBERAL CHURCH ON THE CONTINENT, YET THIS POSITION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT, EXCEPTING THE BATTLE CREEK CHURCH ONLY. OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THINGS AT OAKLAND, OUR SON, J. E. WHITE, WRITING NOVEMBER 29, SAYS:",
