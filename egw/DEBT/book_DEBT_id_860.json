I \n\n                                     -189- \n\nshall move forward cautiously and as fast as we can and not incur debt. This we must not do if we can avoid it. Elder Haskell proposes to furnish a good-sized room economically, and then when patients that can pay come, charge them a reasonable price for room, board, and treatment. Here many things cost double what we have to pay in America, therefore it means something to furnish rooms, and the rent is three pounds per week. We shall have to build a sanitarium, and I wish we could do this at once, but I fear it will not be done, for unless help comes from abroad it cannot be done.",
