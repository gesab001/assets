    "word": "\\n     I have been trying to enumerate some of the blessings we receive from God. Two or three times a day we sit down to a table spread with food to supply us with strength. This food is the Lord's. Those who eat three times a day are indebted to the Lord for one thousand and ninety-five meals in one year. But how few remember, when they partake of food, that they are sitting at the Lord's table! How few bring the poor to their homes to share their blessings! Many are afraid to share with the poor that which the Lord has given them. They think that thus they would be made poor, forgetting the words, \\\"There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\\\"",
