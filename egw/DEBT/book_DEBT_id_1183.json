    "word": "\\n     If men do not reflect the spirit and attributes of Christ, God cannot take pleasure in them. One word which exalts self causes the light of God's countenance to be withdrawn. Those only who, by prayer and watchfulness and love, work the works of Christ, can God rejoice over with singing. The more fully the Lord sees the character of his beloved Son revealed in his people, the greater is his satisfaction and delight in them. God himself, and the heavenly angels, rejoice over them with singing. The believing sinner is pronounced innocent, while the guilt is placed on Christ. The righteousness of Christ is placed on the debtor's account, and against his name on the balance sheet is written: Pardoned. Eternal Life.",
