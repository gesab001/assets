    "word": "\\n     \\\"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.\\\" No soul who believes in Christ, even tho his faith may be weak and his steps wavering, is to be lightly esteemed. By all that has given us advantage over another,--be it education, refinement, Christian training, religious experience, we are in debt to those less favored, and, so far as lies in our power, we are to stay up the hands of the weak. Angels of glory, that do always behold the face of the Father in heaven, joy in ministering to His little ones. Trembling souls, who have many objectionable traits of character, are their special charge. Angels are ever present where they are most needed, with those who have the hardest battle with self to fight, and whose surroundings are the most discouraging.",
