    "word": "\\n     Not he who is pompous, boastful, and unbelieving, but the humble, faithful soul, is in God's sight accounted a man of power. In order that he may answer the prayers of his people, the Lord desires them to obtain a personal knowledge of Christ. The clearer their view of the Saviour's loveliness, the more humble will be their opinion of themselves. And the lower their estimate of self, the more distinct will be their view of the glory and majesty of God. When we begin to have a high opinion of ourselves, let us remember that for whatever we are or have in advance of our fellow men we are indebted wholly to the gift of God.",
