But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\\\" He who is unforgiving cuts off the very channel through which alone he can receive mercy from God. We are to have a spirit of compassion toward those who have trespassed against us, whether or not they confess their faults. However sorely they may have wounded us, we are not to cherish our grievances, and sympathize with ourselves over our injuries; but as we hope to be pardoned for our offenses against God, we are to pardon all who have done evil to us. \\n\\n                                               -\\n",
