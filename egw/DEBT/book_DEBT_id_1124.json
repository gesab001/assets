    "word": "\\n     I appeal to the congregation that regularly assemble at our Tabernacle: Will you not bring in your offerings to lift the debt from the Lord's house? I appeal to those who send their children to Battle Creek, where they unite with us in the worship of God: Will you not assist us to lift this debt? I invite all to be especially liberal at this time. Let cheerful freewill-offerings be brought to the Lord, let us consecrate to Him all that we are, and all that we have, and then may we all unite to swell the songs,-- \\n\\n\\n           \\\"Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; \\n            Praise him, all creatures here below; \\n            Praise him above, ye heavenly host; \\n            Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\\\" \\n\\n                                               -\\n",
