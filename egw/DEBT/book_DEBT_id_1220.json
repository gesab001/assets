    "word": "\\n     The Missionary Acre plan of raising means for the payment of the Battle Creek College debt, is a wise and good one. Let us be thankful for this plan, and make it a success. Let all who can, heartily enter into it, thus lifting their part of the burden. Let the labor rest upon many, instead of upon a few. By cultivating land and devoting the profits to the Missionary Acre Fund, we may not only help a worthy cause, but receive a blessing ourselves because of our prayerful, hopeful effort.",
