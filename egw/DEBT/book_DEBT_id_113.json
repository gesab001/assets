    "word": "Why the Debts Remain \n\n     Slothful servants is the charge that God makes of those in the churches. His will is not done when sacred things are left to remain in a withered, neglected condition. Self-sacrifice, self-denial in every church would change the order of things. \"The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith the Lord of hosts.\" When that gold and silver is used for selfish purposes, to gratify ambition or pride or selfish indulgence, as has been done, God is dishonored.",
