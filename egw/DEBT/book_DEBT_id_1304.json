    "word": "\\n     If we are thinking soberly, if we are living righteously, we shall have a good influence over those that are associated with us; for we shall be breathing in the atmosphere of heaven. And we should think soberly; for we are not here to bless ourselves only, but as sinners and debtors to God, we are to work out our salvation with fear and trembling, and help others that they, too, may be saved. If we would have the Lord purify us unto himself, we must do on our part all that we can that iniquity may be removed from us. We must have a living experience with Christ; and if we love God, we shall want to talk of him to others, and lead them to the fountain of life.",
