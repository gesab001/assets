Let those in the Review & Herald remember that their brethren, who have labored so earnestly in behalf of the school, deserve the favors God designs them to have as they seek to establish the school in a more favorable locality. Let not those in the Review & Herald office think that they will do God service by binding about the school interests. God saw that his servants were sacrificing and trying to raise money to free the school from debt.\"",
