    "word": "\\n     There is a much greater work devolving upon the individual members of the church than they realize. They are not awake to the claims of God upon them. The time has come when every means must be devised that can aid in preparing a people to stand in the day of God. We must be wide awake not to let precious opportunities pass unimproved. We must do all that we possibly can do to win souls to love God and keep his commandments. Jesus requires this of those who know the truth. Is his demand unreasonable? Do we not have the life of Christ as our example? Do we not owe to Christ a debt of love, of earnest, unselfish labor for the salvation of souls for whom he has given his own life?",
