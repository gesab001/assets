    "word": "\\n     There are thousands in our cities and towns, both near and far, who are hungering and thirsting for a knowledge of the truth. When it is presented to them, they embrace it, and, like Philip, they go in search of their friends and relatives, to tell them the glad news. Like the man who found the treasure hid in a field, they give up all else, that their longings of soul may be satisfied. Because they love Jesus so much, they love all for whom he died, and they cannot keep to themselves the precious knowledge, for they feel themselves to be debtors to all men to make known what is the fellowship of the mystery that is hid in Christ Jesus.",
