    "word": "The conference furnishes me with two laborers. The rest I pay myself. The hard times have made it very hard for us all. I have two books in the hands of the printers--Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, and a large and revised edition of The Life of Christ. The manuscript for this has just been sent. It will cost me $2,000 for my share of cuts for this book. Hard times have come, and we cannot sell our books as fast as we desire, therefore we shall feel the pressure till times change. At present I am in debt in America several thousand dollars. If the book I now have ready for the press has a successful sale, I hope we shall realize enough to pay our debts. I am paying interest on this money. I want to do more for this field before I leave it, and I may end my life here.",
