    "word": "\\n     On another occasion Jesus enforced the duty of forgiveness still more earnestly. Peter asked, \\\"How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?\\\" In reply, Jesus related a parable of a certain king who forgave his servant a debt of ten thousand talents, but who revoked the pardon, and commanded this servant to be delivered to the tormentors, because in his dealings with his fellow-servants he did not carry out the same righteous principles that had been manifested in dealing with him. After he had received so great mercy, he would not, in his turn, forgive a small debt of a hundred pence, but, on the contrary, treated his debtor with great severity. Our Lord concludes in these impressive words: \\\"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\\\"",
