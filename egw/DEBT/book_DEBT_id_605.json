    "word": "O, what a sight it would be for the angels to look upon to see the institutions established for the illustration and promulgation of the principles of reform and Christian living, God's instrumentalities, passing out of the hands of those who can use them in God's work, into the hands of the world! The Lord's treasures are at hand, lent to us in trust, for just such emergencies. God's people should serve him in truth and righteousness. They should appropriate their God-given means to help their fellow-workers in a time of need. All our churches should now act \n\n\n                      -21- \n\nwhole-heartedly and unitedly in this matter, determined to avert the great calamity threatening the cause through the crippling or loss of the Lord's instrumentalities. Angels of God will cooperate with us in freeing from debt those institutions in Denmark and Norway, so that no reproach shall rest upon the Lord's cause.",
