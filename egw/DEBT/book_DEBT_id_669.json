    "word": "Let all think soberly; for it is a solemn thing to live. Our lives are not our own; we are kept by the power of God, and Jesus desires to live his life in us, perfecting our characters. The present is an opportunity which God's people can not afford to lose. God calls us to action, that our educational institutions may be freed from debt. Let God's plan be worked out after his own order. Let the very most be made of this, the Lord's opportunity. Let the ministers of our churches, and the presidents of our conferences awaken. Let every church arouse and do to the very utmost of its power. Let every family and every individual consecrate themselves to God, putting the leaven of evil out of their hearts, out of their homes, and out of the church. Let the children act a part. Let all work together; let not the opportunity be lost. Let us do our best at this time to render to God our offering, to carry out his specified will, and thus make this an occasion for witnessing for \n\n\n                        -3- \n\nhim and his truth, in a world of darkness. Let all make this an opportunity to place themselves where they will be sure to receive the answer to their prayers; for Christ says, \"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\"",
