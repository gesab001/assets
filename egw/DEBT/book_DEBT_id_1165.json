    "word": "\\n     I have often thought how much more abundantly we should be blessed if in the larger churches there was a well-organized band of workers, who would become missionaries to cities and towns, teaching others the precious lessons they have learned, of truth, of righteousness, of a judgment to come. All should be learners, but not ever learning and never coming to a knowledge of the truth. Be diligent students, and all the time practice what you learn. This will give you an experience which will be of the highest value to yourselves, and will surely benefit others. God has given us light, which he has commanded us to let shine; and if some souls embrace the truth in a locality, organize them into a church as soon as it can be wisely done, and let them do what they can to build a humble house of worship, as they have done in Willis, which they can dedicate to God, and where they can invite his presence to be with them. He says, \\\"Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\\\" Then let the larger churches which are free from debt, come to the help of their sister churches, and give of their intrusted means toward these smaller places of worship, that the small churches may not be oppressed and discouraged under a load of debt. Let us not like the priest and the Levite, pass by on the other side. What blessings would be meted out to the churches that help in this way, and what love on the part of the poorer churches, as they realized that they were watched over for good! And with this help freely and cheerfully rendered, would come enlarged views of Christian helpfulness and duty. A bond of brotherhood, and love strong and tender, would be created between the members of the churches, large and small; and all petty jealousies and envies would be burned out by the love so substantially expressed.",
