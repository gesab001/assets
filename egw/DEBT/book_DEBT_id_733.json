    "word": "Dear children, Willie has just told me of some things that were related to him by Brother Palmer in reference to the Gospel Primer. I had not heard one word of this from anyone, not even from you; but the matter was presented before me in figure before this time. . . . Trust in the Lord, call upon God in prayer, and look away from men. God cannot make a mistake, He cannot err. If there is no chance whatever for you to cancel your debts, and as far as you can see there is no way open, if the means that would help you do this and to be a blessing to others, is taken away as it appears to be, keep at your work; God knows all about it, and He will open up some way which men will not be able to close. Our God is a God of justice. I know that these things that are not after God's ordering will cut you to the quick.--Letter 87, 1895, pp. 2, 3, 4. (To Edson and Emma White, June 19, 1895.) \n\n\n                                    -264-",
