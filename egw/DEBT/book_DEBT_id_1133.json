    "word": "\\n     This is the voice of God to you, my brethren and sisters who profess to keep the law of God. That law requires that you love your neighbor as yourself. Are you doing it? Our faith is peculiar, and separates us from the world. Our enemies reproach us and bear false witness against us, and if we give them the least occasion, they will reproach our faith also. Do not, I beg of you, deceive your own souls. We are all debtors to divine justice, and we have nothing to pay; but Jesus so pitied us that he paid the debt. He became poor, that through his poverty we might be made rich; and we should prove the sincerity of our gratitude by works of liberality and love performed for Christ's sake. We are assured by the Lord that his poor will always be among us, and we may at any time express our gratitude for his goodness to us by being thoughtful and liberal to them.",
