    "word": "\\n     God is in heaven, but he has delegated his work to those on this earth. This work is to represent Christ. Christ gave himself, a full, complete offering, for the life of the world: and God calls upon all men to make a complete surrender of all they have and are to him, that they may be co-laborers with Christ. This call is just; for to whom is every member of the human family indebted for his possessions?--To God, who not only gives men temporal blessings, but freely offered up his only begotten Son, \\\"that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\\\"",
