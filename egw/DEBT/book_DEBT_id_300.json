    "word": "103\nWhen we come to ask mercy and blessing from God we should have a spirit of love and forgiveness in our own hearts. How can we pray, \u201cForgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,\u201d and yet indulge an unforgiving spirit? Matthew 6:12. If we expect our own prayers to be heard we must forgive others in the same manner and to the same extent as we hope to be forgiven.",
