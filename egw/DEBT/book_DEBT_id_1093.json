    "word": "\\n     At one time the suggestion was made to me that it might be best, when the Relief of the Schools campaign was finished, to make \\\"Christ's Object Lessons\\\" a regular subscription book. It was said that this book would have as ready a sale as any that could be produced. As I heard this suggestion, the thought came to me, \\\"Here is an opportunity for me to get out of debt. Is not this the right thing for me to do?\\\" I said that it might be right for me to do as the letter had suggested. Then I sent a prayer, \\\"Lord, teach me to speak right words.\\\" Quickly the answer came. In an instant the light given at the first regarding \\\"Object Lessons\\\" flashed into my mind, and the instruction then given was repeated. I seemed to hear the words, \\\"God signified that this book should be given to our schools, to be to them a continual blessing. Would you exchange his plan for human devising? This book is to be treated as a sacred offering made to God; and if his plan regarding it is unselfishly carried out, the result will be wholly satisfactory.\\\" I immediately said that I would not make any change in the handling of \\\"Object Lessons\\\" unless God gave me plain instruction that this should be done. As I said this, I felt the blessing of God resting upon me.",
