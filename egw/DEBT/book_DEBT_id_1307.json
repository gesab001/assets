    "word": "\\n     Let those who have means give of their means to the glory of God. Let them show that they appreciate the gift of God's dear Son, that they love him with undivided affection, and will manifest their faith in his mission and work by replenishing the treasury of God. The means that God intrusts to men is for the forwarding of his work in the earth. God's word appeals to you to give. There are souls to be saved. There are those who know not the truth, and they must be enlightened by missionary effort. How many have withheld their tithe? How many have withheld themselves from the service of God? When those who have for years withheld their tithes become convicted, and reckon up and see how large is the sum they owe to God, they must not become discouraged and do nothing to diminish the debt. If you can, pay the whole amount, but if you cannot, do the best you can, begin to pay tithes from the first of 1890. Confess to the Lord your robbery toward him, and give yourselves in full surrender as an offering to the Lord. Tell the Lord that if he will place it in your power, you will meet your obligation to him, and render back to him his own.",
