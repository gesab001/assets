    "word": "\\n     But this work requires means. It is true that times are hard, that money is not plenty; but the truth must be spread, and money to spread it must be placed in the treasury. Many are trembling with fear because the work moves faster than their slow faith, and means is expended more rapidly than it comes into the treasury; and yet we have taken only the first few steps in advance. Our message is world-wide; yet many are doing nothing, and many more, so very little, and with so great a want of faith, that it is next to nothing. Shall we abandon the field that has already been opened in foreign countries? Shall we drop part of the work in our home missions? Shall we be disheartened at a debt of a few thousand dollars? Shall we falter and become laggards in the very last scenes of this world's history? My heart says, No, no! I cannot contemplate this question without a burning zeal in my soul to see this work go. We would not deny our faith, we would not deny Christ; yet we shall commit this fearful sin unless we move forward, as the providence of God opens the way. The work must not stop for want of means. More money must be invested. \\\"Sell that ye have and give alms.\\\" There is a time coming when commandment-keepers can neither buy nor sell. In the last extremity, before this work shall close, thousands of dollars will be cheerfully laid upon the altar. Men and women will feel it a blessed privilege to share in the great work of preparing souls to stand in the great day of God, and they will give hundreds as readily as five dollars are given now. But let us not dishonor God by thinking that the church has not the means to do all the work that devolves upon her just now.",
