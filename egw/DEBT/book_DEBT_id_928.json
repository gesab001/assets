    "word": "Our sanitarium work at Loma Linda may be carried on with simplicity, without incurring a heavy debt. Let our people be wise and true, and do their work in a humble way, in order that means may be saved in every line possible. This will facilitate the establishment of sanitariums in other places. My brethren, study to show yourselves approved unto God. We are laborers together with God, to save the souls and the bodies of many, to the glory of Christ Jesus. \n\n\n                           (Signed) Ellen G.
