    "word": "\\n     The Saviour's humanity elevates all humanity in the scale of moral value with God. It brings God and man very nigh together. \\\"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.\\\" By giving his life to save fallen men, Christ gives all heaven to those that believe on him. By dying in our behalf, he gave an equivalent for our debt. Thus he removed from God all charge of lessening the guilt of sin. By virtue of my oneness with the Father, he says, my suffering and death enable me to pay the penalty of sin. By my death a restraint is removed from his love. His grace can act with unbounded efficiency.",
