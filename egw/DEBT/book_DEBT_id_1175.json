    "word": "\\n     God holds us as his debtors, and also as debtors to our fellow men who have not the light of truth. He has given us light, not to hide under a bushel, but to set on a candlestick, that all around us may be benefited. The grace of God ruling in the heart, and bringing the mind and thoughts into subjection to Jesus, will make us strong to work for him.",
