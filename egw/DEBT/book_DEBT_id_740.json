    "word": "The Lord is weighing actions. He has been telling those who have been crowding into Battle Creek to go out of Battle Creek, and begin in other places a work for those who need help. But how many have heeded the instruction given? In the place of people leaving Battle Creek, more money, ten thousand dollars, was called for to erect additional school buildings, while the college was under a heavy debt. How much better would it have been if they had heeded the word of the Lord.",
