Its mission is to carry the gospel to the world. Jesus said to the representatives of his church, \\\"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\\\" There is no limitation to this command. The good news of a Saviour,--Christ dying as our sacrifice upon Calvary, Christ pleading as our high-priest and intercessor before God, Christ our king and deliverer, coming to redeem his children,--this is the message to be carried to all the world, to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. And the obligation rests upon all Christians. Every one, to the very utmost of his talent and opportunity, is to fulfill this commission. The love of Christ, revealed to us, makes us debtors to all who know him not. They are our brethren, and God has given us light, not for ourselves alone, but to shed upon them.",
