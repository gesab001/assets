Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you; and be a father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\\\" What large and comprehensive promises God has given us in his word. Because of the great goodness of God to us, we can say with Paul, \\\"I am a debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.\\\"",
