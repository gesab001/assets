    "word": "The Review and Herald and the College Debt. \n\n                                         June 6, 1899. \n\n\n     I read in the G. C. Bulletin proposals that the Review and Herald forgive the indebtedness of the Battle Creek College. That night instruction was given me from the Lord, that there were debts upon the Review and Herald, which would make it unjust for the R. & H. Pub. Co. to do this. The General Conference and the Review and Herald are acting for the whole of the people in the Sabbath-keeping ranks. They take the people's money that is there invested, and use it to relieve the school debt. If the word of the Lord had been heeded, these debts would not now exist. The light the Lord gave years ago was that the school building last proposed should not be erected. But unwise advisers turned from the counsels of God. There should be no more necessities made, no more inducements offered to bring people to Battle Creek.",
