    "word": "\\n     Brother W. R. Simpson, the manager, told me that the earnings of the institution are sufficient to make possible a reduction of the debt. For some time the sanitarium has been filled with patients. There are those who can not go far from Los Angeles for treatment. The close proximity of the Glendale Sanitarium to Los Angeles, makes it possible for such ones to patronize this institution. Glendale is a very important member of the sisterhood of medical institutions in southern California. Let us continue to praise the Lord that he has given us this institution to use for the honor of his name.",
