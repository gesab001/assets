To each of us he has intrusted talents, and for their proper use he holds us responsible. It is his will that we so educate ourselves as to be able to use these talents in a manner to accomplish the greatest good in the world and to reflect glory to the Giver; and our faculties may be so cultivated, so discreetly directed and controlled, as to accomplish this object.",
