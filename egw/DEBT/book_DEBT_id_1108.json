    "word": "\\n     We shall have a debt to settle with the Master by-and-by, when he shall say, Give an account of thy stewardship. If men prefer to set aside the claims of God, and grasp and selfishly retain all that he gives them, he will hold his peace at present, and continue frequently to test them by increasing his bounties, and by letting his blessings flow on, and these men pass on receiving honor of men, and without censure in the church, but by-and-by he will say, \\\"Give an account of thy stewardship.\\\" Says Christ, \\\"Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.\\\" \\\"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price,\\\" and are under obligation to glorify God with your means as well as in your body, and in your spirit, which are his.",
