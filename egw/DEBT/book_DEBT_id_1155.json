    "word": "\\n     The prodigal's soul had been stirred to the very depths by remorse and repentance, and why should not those who have been partakers of light, give the repenting sinner the right help at the right time? At one time, Jesus asked Simon who would love his benefactor most, the one to whom a small debt was forgiven, or the one to whom a large debt was forgiven. Simon answered that the one who had been forgiven most, would love most. Those who have been in despair over their course of action, manifest corresponding gratitude and love in return, when they receive the pardoning love of God. I have received letters at different times from persons who were in despair over their sins. One and another would say, \\\"I fear I am past all help. Let me hear from you as soon as possible. Is there any hope for me?\\\" To these poor souls I have written, \\\"Hope in God. The Father has bread enough and to spare. Arise, and go to your Father. He will meet you a great way off. He will give you his love and compassion.\\\"",
