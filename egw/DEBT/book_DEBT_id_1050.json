Many have been defrauded of their just dues in this way, and it is just as criminal in the sight of God, as for one to keep back the wages of one who is employed in any other regular business. It is the worst kind of generalship to allow a conference to stand still or to fail to settle its honest debts. There is a great deal of this done, and whenever this is done, God is displeased.",
