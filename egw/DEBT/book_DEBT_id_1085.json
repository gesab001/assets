    "word": "\\n     Nowhere is the duty of forgiveness so plainly taught and so impressively enforced as in the lessons of Christ. Study the parable of the two debtors: \\\"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents.\\\" Here was one man in high position who had been intrusted with a vast amount of property. But upon an examination of his accounts he was found unfaithful; he owed his lord ten thousand talents. This, at the lowest computation, amounts to nearly ten million dollars. When the king saw the evidence of his servant's unfaithfulness, he commanded him to be sold, with his wife and children, his houses, his lands, and all that he had, that payment might be made. Alarm seized the unfaithful man, as he saw ruin before him, and he pleaded for delay: \\\"Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\\\" But his lord knew that he could never pay the debt. While the servant acknowledged the justice of the sentence against him, he begged for mercy. \\\"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.\\\" What joy was this, what relief from the shadow of his wrong course, which surrounded him like a cloud! He went forth from the presence of his lord with the whole debt canceled. But circumstances occurred which tested the true spirit of this man,--whether he would manifest the same forgiveness and mercy that had been shown toward him, or whether his joy and gratitude were of a selfish nature, and his heart not softened.",
