    "word": "G.W. Reaser: With the blessing of the Lord, we have (514) reduced the indebtedness of Fernando Academy from $24,000 to $4,000 in round numbers. It would not take long to cancel the remaining indebtedness. My whole nature and education were against going into debt heavily, and that was what caused the whole issue down there; and yet when I came up to this camp-meeting, I told Brother Burden that hereafter I was not going to take such strong ground as I had in the past. I confessed \n\n\n                            -291- \n\nto the brethren that I had taken too strong ground, and asked them to forgive me; and I asked the Lord to forgive me, because I was radical in my position, and thought we ought not to go into debt. Sometimes I did not say right things to Brother Burden. But each of us hold nothing against the other.",
