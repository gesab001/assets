    "word": "\\n     Jesus brought out an important lesson in the parable of the unjust steward. He said: \\\"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.\\\" This steward was in a high position, and had been intrusted with a vast amount of property, but upon examining his accounts, he was found unfaithful; he owed his Lord ten thousand talents. When the king saw the evidence of his servant's unfaithfulness, he commanded him to be sold, with his wife and children, his houses, his lands, and all that he had, that payment might be made. Alarm seized the unfaithful man, as ruin stared him in the face, and he pleaded for delay, saying, \\\"Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\\\" But his lord knew that he could never pay the debt. While the servant acknowledged the justice of the sentence against him, he begged for mercy. \\\"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.\\\"",
