    "word": "\\n\\nJanuary 4, 1881 The New Year.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     We should invite our brethren and sisters of other churches, not only in Michigan but in the different States, to consider our situation at Battle Creek. Our institutions being located here, this is a place of no small importance to our cause. In so large a church, there are many more demands for means than in the smaller churches. Many of your poor, your unfortunate, your sick, have for some reason located here. Our College is no financial benefit to the cause in this place, for at this late date it has a heavy debt, which is carried by the Review Office. Yet those who live at a distance are really as much benefited by the College as are our people at Battle Creek.",
