The present is such a time as this. The cause of God is at stake. His institutions are in peril, and, because of the terrible burden of debt under which they are struggling, the work is hindered on every side. Just now, in our great necessity, God has made a way through the difficulty, and invites us to co-operate with Him in accomplishing His purpose. It is His plan that the book, Christ's Object Lessons, be given for the relief of our schools, and He calls upon all who love the truth to do their part in placing this book before the world. In this He is testing His people and His institutions, to see if they will work together and be of one mind in self-denial and self-sacrifice.",
