    "word": "\\n     God is in heaven, but He has delegated His work to those on this earth. This work is to represent Christ. Christ gave himself, a full, complete offering, for the life of the world; and God calls upon all men to make a complete surrender of all they have and are to Him, that they may be co-laborers with Christ. This call is just; for to whom is every member of the family indebted for his possession?--To God, who not only gave temporal blessings, but freely offered up His only begotten Son, \\\"that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\\\"",
