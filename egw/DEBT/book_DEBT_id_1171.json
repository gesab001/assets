    "word": "\\n\\nNovember 19, 1895 \\\"Ask, and Ye Shall Receive.\\\"\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     Luke seems to have been much impressed with the prayers of the Saviour, and with his custom of communing with his Heavenly Father. He records a number of instances where the Saviour engaged in public and private prayer. He says: \\\"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.\\\" Again he writes: \\\"And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. Give us day by day our daily bread. And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.\\\" Jesus repeated this prayer with great solemnity, and then gave his disciples an illustration of the privilege and success of prayer. He gave this lesson to encourage his disciples to be persevering in offering their petitions, and to encourage all in continual striving in prayer.",
