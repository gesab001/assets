{"word": "To Quiet, Kind Manner.--If parents desire their children to be pleasant, they should never speak to them in a scolding manner. The mother often allows herself to become irritable and nervous. Often she snatches at the child and speaks in a harsh manner. If a child is treated in a quiet, kind manner, it will do much to preserve in him a pleasant temper.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 286}
