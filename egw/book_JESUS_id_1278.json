{"word": "God Exalts the Humble--He is most fit to carry responsibilities and command who most resembles God in character,--in goodness, mercy, and staunch loyalty to the cause and work of God.  Every one needs now to work for brother, for friend, for neighbor, and for stranger, drawing the mind away from the discouragements that will crowd in.  The truth is to be magnified.  We must not be surprised at strange movements.  No one must seek exaltation.  The more humbly we move and work, the more will we be exalted with God.  The return of Jesus Christ to our world will not be long delayed.  This is to be the keynote of every message.--Letter 39, 1898, p. 13 (March 27, 1898 to Brethren Woods and Miller).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "ChL", "page": 12}
