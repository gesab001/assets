    "word": "When B. F. Snook embraced the truth, he was very destitute. Liberal souls deprived themselves of conveniences, and even of some of the necessaries of life, to help this minister, whom they believed to be a faithful servant of Christ. They did all this in good faith, helping him as they would have helped their Saviour. But it was the means of ruining the man. His heart was not right with God; he lacked principle. He was not a truly converted man. The more he received, the greater was his desire for means. He gathered all he could from his brethren, until he had been helped, through their liberalities, to a valuable home; then he apostatized, and became the bitterest enemy of the very ones who had been most liberal to him. This man will have to render an account for the means that he has taken from truehearted believers in the truth. He did not rob them, but the treasury of God. We wish him no evil; for \"God shall bring every work into judgment, \n                                                                           626\nwith every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.\" He has walked in the ways of his heart and in the sight of his eyes, but for all these things God will bring him into judgment. All the hidden things of darkness will then be brought to light, and the secret counsels of the heart shall be made manifest.",
