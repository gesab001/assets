{"word": "14. Perpetual Obligation of the Law.--The law of God was not given to the Jews alone. It is of world-wide and perpetual obligation. \"He that offendeth in one point is guilty of all.\" Its ten precepts are like a chain of ten links. If one link is broken, the chain becomes worthless. Not a single precept can be revoked or changed to save the transgressor. While families and nations exist; while property, life, and character must be guarded; while good and evil are antagonistic, and a blessing or a curse must follow the acts of men--so long must the divine law control us. When God no longer requires men to love Him supremely, to reverence His name, and to keep the holy Sabbath; when He permits them to disregard the rights of their fellow men, to hate and injure one another--then, and not till then, will the moral law lose its force (ST Jan. 19, 1882).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2BC", "page": 1014}
