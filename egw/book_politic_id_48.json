{"word": "God's children are to separate themselves from politics, from any alliance with unbelievers. They are not to link their interests with the interests of the world. \"Give proof of your allegiance to Me,\" He says, \"by standing as My chosen heritage, as a people zealous of good works.\" Do not take part in political strife. Separate from the world, and refrain from bringing into the church or school ideas that will lead to contention and disorder. Dissension is the moral poison taken into the system by human beings who are selfish. God wants His servants to have clear perceptions, true and noble dignity, that their influence may demonstrate the power of truth.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW", "page": 395}
