{"word": "Deal Gently.--Let us not try to work ourselves or others, but let us depend upon the Holy Spirit. Deal gently with human beings. With hearts full of spiritual tenderness, melt your way into convicted hearts. Let your words be dipped in the heavenly oil from the two olive branches. We need the golden oil emptied into prepared vessels, that it may be communicated to those who are seeking for the truth. Ever remember that it is \"not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\"--Lt 200, 1899.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 440}
