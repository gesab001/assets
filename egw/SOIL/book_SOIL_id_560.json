    "word": "Nature to Be a Lesson Book--The educational advantages of our school [Avondale College] are to be of a distinct order. This school farm is God's lesson book. Those who till the soil and plant and cultivate the orchard are to make the application of nature's lessons, and bring these lessons learned into their actual spiritual experience. Let every individual bear in mind that \"whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\" The man who day by day sows objectionable seeds, in words, in deportment, in spirit, is conforming himself to the same character, and this is determining the future harvest he will reap.--Ms. 116, 1898, pp. 2, 3. (\"Two Great Principles of the Law,\" Sept. 16, 1898.)",
