    "word": "I would that I could present the meaning of this symbol as it has been presented me. The church members who are standing in their lot and place are trees of righteous, the planting of the Lord. Although their surrounding circumstances may be adverse, yet, like the fir-tree with little soil about its roots, they constantly reach heavenward, drawing nourishment from above. Like the fragrant boughs of the fir-tree, they impart grace for grace received. The hidden nourishment that comes from God is returned to Him in purest service.",
