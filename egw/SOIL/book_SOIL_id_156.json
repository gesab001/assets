    "word": "The unbelief which is cherished in the soul has a bewitching power. The seeds of doubt that they have been sowing will produce their harvest but they must continue to dig up every root of unbelief.

The soul must have the precious plants of faith and love put in the soil of the heart and enthroned there.",
