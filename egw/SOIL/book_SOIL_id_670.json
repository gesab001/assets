    "word": "Brother and Sister Shireman's danger is in supposing that their talents are sufficient to enable them to do all that must be done in one of our schools. They should not suppose that they can do the work that is essential in educating the youth. This work must be done by those whose talents and training fit them to be educators, enabling them to give the students a complete education. In stead of consenting to carry responsibilities that the Lord has not fitted them to carry, they should go out to other places to arouse an interest and to begin a work similar to the work begun at Hildebran. Taking with them some young helpers to cooperate with them, they could use the breaking-up plow, preparing the soil in new fields and sowing the seed. God will give the increase.",
