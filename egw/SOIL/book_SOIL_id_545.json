    "word": "Homes for Consumptives.--Sanitariums that are erected for consumptive patients should be placed some distance out of the city, where there is plenty of open space, a clear stream, and land which can be cultivated. Then the patients can be drawn out into the fresh air, while those who are strong can cultivate the soil. The institution built for consumptives which has not these accompaniments cannot benefit the patients. Such an institution Seventh-day Adventists are at the present time unable to maintain.",
