    "word": "The parable of the sower and the seed conveys a deep spiritual lesson. The seed represents the principles sowed in the heart, and its growth the development of character. Make the teaching on this point practical. The children can prepare the soil, and sow the seed; and as they work, the parent or teacher can explain to them the garden of the heart with the good or bad seed sown there; and that as the garden must be prepared for the natural seed, so the heart must be prepared for the seed of truth. As the plant \n                                                                           71\ngrows, the correspondence between the natural and the spiritual sowing can be continued.",
