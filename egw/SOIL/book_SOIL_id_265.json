    "word": "Walk in Jesus' footsteps, not by visiting where He lived, but by working as He worked.--Among our workers are some who feel that a great object would be gained if their feet could tread the soil of old Jerusalem. But God's cause and work will never be advanced by His workers wandering about to find where Jesus traveled and wrought His miracles. Would you trace the footsteps of Christ, behold Him in that hovel, ministering to the poor; see Him at that sick bed, comforting the suffering, and speaking hope and courage to the desponding. Those who walk in the footsteps of Jesus will do as He did. \"Whosoever will come after me,\" He said, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\"--RH July 30, 1901.",
