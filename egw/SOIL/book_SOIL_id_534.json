    "word": "I thank the Lord that the brethren heeded the instruction given them, and that they carried forward His work in simplicity and meekness, and yet intelligently. The Lord is qualifying them to teach the lessons He has given in His word, by object lessons from nature. This is the grandest, the most helpful, all-around education that the youth can have. Cultivating the soil, \n\n\n                                    -411- \n\nplanting and caring for trees, sowing seed and watching its growth,--this work teaches precious lessons. Nature is an expositor of the word of the living God. But only through Christ does creation answer the highest purpose of the Creator. The Saviour has wonderful revelations for all who will walk humbly with God. Under the discipline and training of the higher teaching, they will behold wondrous things out of His law.",
