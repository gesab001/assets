    "word": "Physical and Mental Training to Be Combined--The education to be gained in the felling of trees, the tilling of the soil, and the erection of buildings, as well as the studies of the classroom, is what our youth should seek to obtain. Tentmaking also should be taught. Buildings should be erected, and masonry should be learned.
