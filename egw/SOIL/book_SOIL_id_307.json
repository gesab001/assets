    "word": "For this reason the cultivation of the soil is good work for children and youth. It brings them into direct contact with nature and nature's God. . . .

There is health and happiness for him in the study of nature; and the impressions made will not fade out of his mind, for they will be associated with objects that are continually before his eyes.",
