    "word": "I cannot tell you what you should do, but I can tell you what not to do: Do not worry, be not unbelieving, and do not think that you can blossom into a perfect school at its very planting on new soil. You must remember that it takes time to plant, and to perfect that plant. You just hold fast every inch you have.--Letter 184, 1901, pp. 1-6. (To Prof. P. T. Magan during the early months of his endeavor to establish the college at Berrien Springs, Mich. Written at South Lancaster, Mass., December 7, 1901.)",
