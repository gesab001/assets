    "word": "[In] every harvest this lesson of the grain of wheat is repeated. Those who till the soil have the illustration of Christ's words ever before them. The seed buried in the ground produces much fruit, and in their turn the seeds of this fruit are planted. Thus the harvest is multiplied. The harvest of the cross of Calvary will bear fruit unto eternal life. And the contemplation of this will be the glory of those who will live through eternal ages. With this lesson Christ connects the self-sacrifice we must practice.--Manuscript 33, April 6, 1897, \"We Would See Jesus.\"",
