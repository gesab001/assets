Buildings should be erected, and masonry should be learned. There are also many things in which the lady students may be engaged. There is cooking, dressmaking, and gardening to be done. Strawberries should be planted, plants and flowers cultivated. This the lady students may be called out of doors to do. Thus they may be educated to useful labor.
