{"word": "Christ is here teaching a precious lesson in regard to His service. Whatever experiences may come to you, He says, serve God. Whatever inconveniences and hardships you may encounter, trust in the Lord. We have no cause to worry and fear if we take our position for the truth, that we and our families will suffer. To do this is to manifest unbelief in God. \"Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\" the Saviour says. If we would study the Word more faithfully, we would increase in faith.--Manuscript 83, 1909.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 238}
