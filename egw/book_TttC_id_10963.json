    "word": "\"Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search My sheep, and seek them out. . . . So will I seek out My sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. . . . I will feed My flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God. I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick. . . . And I will make with them a covenant of peace. . . . And I will make them and the places round about My hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing. . . . Thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them. . . . And ye My flock, the flock of My pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God.\" \n\n\n                                                  (231)",
