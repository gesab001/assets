{"word": "God has begun to work in this country, and the church must unite with heavenly intelligences, manifesting holy activity, and by exercising their powers become more efficient to save souls and glorify God. We who have seen the light of truth, are called upon to aid in its advancement, to waken to the large responsibility of the missionary work to be accomplished in our borders; and it is the duty of every soul to co-operate with those who would advance the work. Let every one seek to draw in even cords with Christ. Let us hide our ways in God's ways, that all variance may cease, that Christ's character may be represented in kindness, forbearance, self-denial, meekness, humility, and love. Let all join heartily to do the utmost of their ability to support the school that is now to be established; for in the hands of God it may be the means of educating workers to shed forth the light of truth upon the people. Who will be on the Lord's side? Who will now see the work to be done, and do it?--Supplement to The Bible Echo, Sept. 1, 1892.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 211}
