{"word": "32: Pentecost\n \n\n     WHEN Jesus opened the understanding of the disciples to the meaning of the prophecies concerning Himself, He assured them that all power was given Him in heaven and on earth, and bade them go preach the gospel to every creature. The disciples, with a sudden revival of their old hope that Jesus would take His place upon the throne of David at Jerusalem, inquired, \"Wilt Thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?\" Acts 1:6. The Saviour threw an uncertainty over their minds in regard to the subject by replying that it was not for them \"to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in His own power.\" Acts 1:7.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 241}
