{"word": "God's Part and Yours.--Christian parents, I entreat you to awake. . . . If you neglect your duty and shirk your responsibility, expecting the Lord to do your work, you will be disappointed. When you have faithfully done all that you can do, bring your children to Jesus; and with earnest, persevering faith, make intercession for them. The Lord will be your helper; He will work with your efforts; in His strength you will gain the victory. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 172}
