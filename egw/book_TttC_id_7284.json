    "word": "It is not safe to trust to physicians who have not the fear of God before them. Without the influence of divine grace the hearts of men are \"deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.\" Self-aggrandizement is their aim.

The Lord \n                                                                           195\nour God assures us that He is waiting to be gracious; He invites us to call upon Him in the day of trouble. How can we turn from Him to trust in an arm of flesh?",
