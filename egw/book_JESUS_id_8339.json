Every time we talk them, Satan has gained the victory; but when we say, \"I will commit the keeping of my soul unto Him, as unto a faithful witness,\" then we testify that we have given ourselves to Jesus Christ without any reservation, and then God gives us light and we rejoice in Him. We want to place ourselves under the bright beams of the Sun of righteousness, and then we shall be a light in the world. \"Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory\" (1 Peter 1:8).--MS 17, 1894.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 578}
