    "word": "Pray with simple faith. In the future world we shall see what great victories have been won by the prayer of faith. Prayer has \"subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions [not only beasts of prey, but human beings], quenched the violence of fire, [we shall know what this means when we hear the reports of the martyrs who died for their faith and felt no pain], escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens\" [Hebrews 11:33, 34].",
