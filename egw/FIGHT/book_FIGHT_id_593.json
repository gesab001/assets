    "word": "A Hard Battle, but God Will Help.--Do you use tobacco or intoxicating liquor? Cast them from you; for they becloud your faculties. To give up the use of these things will mean a hard battle, but God will help you to fight this battle. Ask Him for grace to overcome, and then believe that He will give it to you, because He loves you. Do not allow worldly companions to draw you away from your allegiance to Christ. Rather let your mind be drawn from these companions to Christ. Tell them that you are seeking for heavenly treasure. You are not your own; you have been bought with a price, \n                                                                           104\neven the life of the Son of God, and you are to glorify God in your body and in your spirit, for they are His.--Letter 226, 1903.",
