    "word": "We desire to bind the students to our hearts by the cords of love and kindness, but [with] strict discipline. Love and kindness are worth nothing unless they are united with the discipline which God has said should be maintained. We call upon every student who has a knowledge of God to exert an influence on the Lord's side. We desire you all to be in the Lord's army. We desire you to stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince Emmanuel, to fight manfully the battles of the Lord. We want you to put on the whole armor of righteousness. We want you to gain everything that Christ suffered so much to make it possible for you to gain.",
