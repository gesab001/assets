    "word": "Christ Himself, the Majesty of heaven, leads the children of God against their enemies. Thousands of holy angels wait to help those who are seeking for immortality and eternal life. A crown of glory waits for all who fight the good fight of faith, and when the warfare is over they will be greeted with the words, \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" [Revelation 22:14]. Then, casting their glittering crowns at the feet of Jesus, and touching their golden harps, the redeemed host will fill all heaven with rich music.--Ms. 21, 1895.",
