    "word": "The Lord requires our undivided affection. If men are not whole hearted, they will fail in the day of trial. When the enemy shall put his forces in array against them, and the battle seems to go hard, at the very time when all the strength of intellect, all the tact of wise-generalship, is needed to repulse the enemy, those who are half-hearted will turn their weapons against their own soldiers; they weaken the hands that should be strong for warfare. God is testing all \n\n142. \n\nwho have a knowledge of the truth to see if they can be depended on to fight the battles of the Lord when hard pressed by principalities and powers and the rulers of the darkness of the world and wicked spirits in high places. Perilous times are before us, and our only safety is in having the converting power of God every day, yielding ourselves fully to Him to do His will, and walk in the light of His countenance. (See 1 Peter 2;9)",
