    "word": "Now suppose that right here in our school we should be fitted for the work. God gave Moses a special work for which he was to have a special preparation. Moses thought that he was to do that work by force and by might, and he went and slew one who was fighting with an Israelite, and hid him in the sand. He thought the Israelites ought to know that he was the one who should deliver Israel, and he was going to begin the work in a hurry. But the Lord takes that man, Moses, seeing that he is not ready for the work, and sends him for forty years to act as a keeper of sheep. He goes into the rocks in the mountains, in the desert, and there hunts with all patience for the stray sheep. And then the Lord reveals Himself in the bush to him as the \"I AM\" and bids him go and deliver the children of Israel. Now, he has the education, but it took him forty years to learn to be a tender, patient, loving, faithful shepherd. . . .",
