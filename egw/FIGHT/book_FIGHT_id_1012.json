    "word": "This is the sanctification to which those attain whose love of God's law increases as the contempt of transgressors increases. There is need for this increased confidence in the law, for fraud, violence, and crime are rapidly increasing. Men show their hatred of God by fighting against His law which He has pronounced \"holy and just and good.\" Liquor saloons are established in every city. These are death traps, and those who establish them, seeking to accumulate gain at the cost of poverty, misery, and woe, provoke the Lord of hosts to their destruction.",
