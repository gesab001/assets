    "word": "Satan takes advantage of every unconsecrated element for the accomplishment of his purposes. Among those who profess to be the supporters of God's cause there are those who unite with His enemies and thus lay His cause open to the attacks of His bitterest foes. Even some who desire the work of God to prosper will yet weaken the hands of His servants by hearing, reporting, and half believing the slanders, boasts, and menaces of His adversaries. . . . The response of faith today will be the response made by Nehemiah, \"Our God shall fight for us;\" for God is in the work, and no man can prevent its ultimate success.",
