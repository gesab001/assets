    "word": "The Lord has a work for you to do. Be wholly on the Lord's side, and have no association with those who would entangle your soul in doubts and questionings, because you are weak in this direction and need to fight constantly the fight of faith. War the good warfare, lay hold on eternal life. Press through difficulties to the mark of the prize.",
