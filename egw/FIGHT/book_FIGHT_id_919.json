    "word": "What a work we have before us! Do you want a part in this closing work? It is a work that will triumph. Do you wish to triumph with it? God will use you to act a part in this work if you will be obedient to Him. But \n\n\n                                   -289- \n\nif the grace of God is [to be] made your own, you must do your part and co-operate with God. You must place yourself in right relation to God. You must be a transformed man. You must bring forth fruit meet for repentance. The fountain of salvation is now standing open for you, but you must make no delay. Be diligent to place yourself in the most favorable position to secure all the privileges and help the Lord is ready to give you for the work of overcoming. God is speaking to you through His servant. Will you hear His voice? We are to fight, to wrestle, to labor, to strive, to run the race with patience, laying aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us. The Bible leaves the responsibility of our ruin at our own door.",
