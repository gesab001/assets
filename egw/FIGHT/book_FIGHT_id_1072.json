    "word": "I have recently sent very earnest, decided testimonies to men in responsible positions that they should not have occupied up to this time without evidence of a thorough transformation of character. Whatever their business tact, these men who have so long been evidently resisting light and evidence, fighting against God, should have been separated from the work, both for their own souls sake and for the sake of the cause. For while they are kept in positions of trust, their voice and influence sway many things in the wrong direction. When matters of the greatest importance have come up for decision, their judgment on the questions has depended on the state of mind they chanced to be in. The mind and heart are not under the influence of the Spirit of God. They are men of strong temperament, decided preferences, and much force of character, and their will and influence have decided matters under the control of another spirit than the Spirit of God.",
