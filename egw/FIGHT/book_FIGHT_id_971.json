    "word": "Whatever moral power any of us possess, it does not come by inheritance; it is attained only by [a] minute-by-minute fight of faith. This is the only way anyone can come into possession of the higher wisdom, which is first pure, then peaceable, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits. These words are to be carefully pondered. Unless they are practiced, souls will be lost. \"Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another\" [Ephesians 4:25]. These words need to be acted upon, for the Lord looketh upon the heart, and He cannot be in any way deceived by pretense and by hypocrisy.",
