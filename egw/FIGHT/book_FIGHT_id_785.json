    "word": "This message concerns all our churches. You can never employ your faculty of hearing better than in hearkening to hear what the voice of God speaks to you in His Word. There is a rich and abundant promise to those who overcome. It is not enough to enter upon this warfare, we must pursue it to the end. We must know nothing of yielding. We must fight the good fight of faith to the very end. To the overcomer is promised the triumphal victory. \"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.\" Whatever was lost in the fall of Adam is more than restored in redemption. He that sitteth on the throne saith, \"Behold, I make all things new\" (Revelation 21:5).",
