    "word": "The Privilege of Heirship.--Oh, what an exaltation is this--to be members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King! To have the Saviour of the universe, the King over all kings, know us by name and to be heirs of God to the immortal inheritance, the eternal substance! This is our privilege; will we have the prize? Will we fight the battles of the Lord? Will we press the battle to the gate? Will we be victorious? I have decided that I must have heaven and I want you to have it. . . . I never would have come, at my age, from California to Europe had I not wanted to tell you how precious the Saviour is and what a precious truth we have.",
