    "word": "We fight not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and powers, and spiritual \n\n\n                 -97- \n\nwickedness in high places, and God is with us. We are not to consider that the smartness of men will bring success. One may have all the learning possible for a human being to comprehend, and yet he may be alone, and without Christ he can do nothing. Do you walk humbly before Him? Have you a cherishing of inward sins, heartburnings against any? Are you seeking God with all your heart? Now, we can bear to be separated from everything else but the Spirit of God. We want the inspiration of the cross, making us to fall helpless, and the Lord will lift us up. Christ prayed not that His followers should be taken out of the world, but that they might be kept from the evil that is in the world. We can go through the world as did Enoch. The world was then no more favorable for the formation of Christian character than it is in our time.",
