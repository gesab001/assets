    "word": "I say again, I am so glad that we have this farm. Not long ago one came to me, and said, \u201cI think it is a mistake to keep that large farm. It is not half cultivated. I think they might better sell a portion of it.\u201d That night instruction was given me regarding the matter. It was God\u2019s purpose that the school should be placed here. He saw that the workers here would not have to fight every inch of ground in order to establish the truth, as the workers in some places have had to do. The instruction was given me, Never part with an acre of this land. It is to be used in educating hundreds. If those who stand here as teachers will do their part, if with courage they will take up the work appointed them, trusting in the Lord, sending their petitions to heaven for light and grace and strength, success will attend their efforts. The teachers are to be kind and tender, and at the same time very thorough in discipline. This is most essential.",
