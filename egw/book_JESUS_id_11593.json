{"word": "51-55 (Isaiah 65:17; Matthew 25:21; 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17; Revelation 5:12;  21:4). The Finishing Touch  of Immortality.--We have a living, risen Saviour. He burst the fetters of the tomb after He had lain there three days, and in triumph. He proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" And He is coming. Are we getting ready for Him? Are we ready so that if we shall fall asleep, we can do so with hope in Jesus Christ? Are you laboring for the salvation of your brothers and sisters? The Life-giver is soon to come. The Life-giver is coming to break the fetters of the tomb. He is to bring forth the captives and proclaim, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" There stands the risen host. The last thought was of death and its pangs. The last thoughts they had were of the grave and the tomb, but now they proclaim, \"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\" The pangs of death were the last things they felt. \"O death, where is thy sting?\" The last thing they acknowledged was the pangs of death. When they awake the pain is all gone. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1093}
