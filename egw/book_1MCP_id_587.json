{"word": "He Works Through Calm, Regular Operation of Laws.--God works through the calm, regular operation of His appointed laws. So it is in spiritual things. Satan is constantly seeking to produce effects by rude and violent thrusts, but Jesus found access to minds by the pathway of their most familiar associations. He disturbed as little as possible their accustomed train of thought, by abrupt actions or prescribed rules. He honored man with His confidence, and thus placed him on his honor. He introduced old truths in a new and precious light. Thus when only twelve years old He astonished the doctors of the law by His questions in the temple.--MS 44, 1894. (Ev 139, 140.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 182}
