{"word": "Potatoes, Irish and Sweet \n\n                                            Letter 322, 1905 \n     517. We do not think fried potatoes are healthful, for there is more or less grease or butter used in preparing them. Good baked or boiled potatoes served with cream and a sprinkling of salt are the most healthful. The remnants of Irish and sweet potatoes are prepared with a little cream and salt and rebaked, and not fried; they are excellent.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 323}
