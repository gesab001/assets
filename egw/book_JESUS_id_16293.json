Before Jesus went away, He promised that He would return again, and receive us unto Himself, \"that where I am,\" He said, \"ye may be also.\" We are strangers and pilgrims in this world. We are to wait, watch, pray, and work. The whole mind, the whole soul, the whole heart, and the whole strength are purchased by the blood of the Son of God. We are not to feel it our duty to wear a pilgrim's dress of just such a color, just such a shape, but neat, modest apparel, that the word of inspiration teaches us we should wear. If our hearts are united with Christ's heart, we shall have a most intense desire \n                                                                           131\nto be clothed with His righteousness. Nothing will be put upon the person to attract attention or to create controversy.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 130}
