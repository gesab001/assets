    "word": "While preparing for the meeting each individual should closely and critically examine his own heart before God. If there have been unpleasant feelings, discord, or strife in families, it should be one of the first acts of preparation to confess these faults one to another and pray with and for one another. Humble yourselves before God, and make an earnest effort to empty the soul temple of all rubbish--all envyings, all jealousies, all suspicions, all faultfindings. \"Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.
