    "word": "Chapter 15 \n\n     9-11. Let Nothing Mar Your Sacrifice.--Watch as faithfully as did Abraham lest the ravens or any birds of prey alight upon your sacrifice and offering to God. Every thought of doubt should be so guarded that it will not see the light of day by utterance. Light always flees from words which honor the powers of darkness (Letter 7, 1892).",
