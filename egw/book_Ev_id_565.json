{"word": "Meetings to Witness Deep Movings of Spirit.--At our meetings held in the cities, and at our camp meetings, we do not ask for great demonstrations, but we ask that the men who come before the people to present the truth shall be in earnest, and shall reveal that God is with them. There must be a special seeking after God, that the work of the meeting may be carried on under the deep movings of the Holy Spirit. There must be no mingling of the wrong with the right.--Review and Herald, July 23, 1908.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 169}
