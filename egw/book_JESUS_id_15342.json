{"word": "Jesus pleaded, not for one only, but for all His disciples: \"Father, I will that they also whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.\" His eye pierced the dark veil of the future and read the life history of every son and daughter of Adam. He felt the burdens and sorrows of every tempest-tossed \n                                                                           530\nsoul, and that earnest prayer included with His living disciples all His followers to the close of time. \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.\" Yes; that prayer of Christ embraces even us. We should be comforted by the thought that we have a great intercessor in the heavens, presenting our petitions before God. \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\" In the hour of greatest need, when discouragement would overwhelm the soul, it is then that the watchful eye of Jesus sees that we need His help. The hour of man's necessity is the hour of God's opportunity. When all human support fails, then Jesus comes to our aid, and His presence scatters the darkness and lifts the cloud of gloom.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "4T", "page": 529}
