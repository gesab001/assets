{"word": "Already has the new year been ushered in; yet before we greet its coming, we pause to ask, What has been the history of the year that with its burden of records has now passed into eternity? The admonition of the apostle comes down the lines to every one of us,\"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.\" God forbid that at this important hour we should be so engrossed with other matters as to give no time to serious, candid, critical self-examination! Let things of minor consequence be put in the background, and let us now bring to the front the things which concern our eternal interests. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 15}
