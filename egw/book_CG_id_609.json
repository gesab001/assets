{"word": "Break Down Satan's Stronghold.--Mothers, the destiny of your children rests to a great extent in your hands. If you fail in duty, you may place them in Satan's ranks and make them his agents to ruin other souls. Or your faithful discipline and godly example may lead them to Christ, and they in turn will influence others, and thus many souls may be saved through your instrumentality.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 224}
