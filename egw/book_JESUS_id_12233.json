{"word": "It is through faith in Jesus Christ that the truth is accepted in the heart and the human agent is purified and cleansed. Jesus was \"wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\" Is it possible to be healed, while knowingly committing sin?--No; it is genuine faith that says, I know that I have committed sin, but that Jesus has pardoned my sin; and hereafter I will resist temptation in and through His might. \"Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.\" He has an abiding principle in the soul, that enables him to overcome temptation.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 297}
