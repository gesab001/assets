Jesus says, \\93If ye love me, keep my commandments\\94not to select out one or two or nine, but the whole ten. All His commandments must be kept. John tells us of those who pretend to love but do not obey God\\92s requirements. \\93He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\\94\\93For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.\\94", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 78}
