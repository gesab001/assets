Let all who labor effectually in the canvassing field feel in their hearts that they are doing the work of the Lord in ministering to souls who know not the truth for this time. They are sounding the note of warning in the highways and byways to prepare a people for the great day of the Lord, which is so soon to break upon the world. We have no time to lose. We must encourage this work. Who will go forth now with our publications? The Lord imparts a fitness for the work to every man and woman who will co-operate with divine power.

The world must hear the warning. When the call comes, \"Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\" \"send back the answer clear and distinct, Here am I; send me.\" \n\n                                               -",
