{"word": "Neglect Not the Sabbath School Lesson \n\n\n     The student of the Sabbath school should feel as thoroughly in earnest to become intelligent in the knowledge of the Scriptures as to excel in the study of the sciences. If either is neglected, it should be the lessons of the six days. The injunction of our Saviour should be religiously regarded by every man, woman, and child who professes His name.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 18}
