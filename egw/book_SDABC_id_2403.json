    "word": "Let Christ Direct.--In your work of character building be sure that Christ is your director. It makes a great difference whether you are laborers together with God or whether you are laborers together against God; whether it is your highest ambition to magnify God or to magnify yourself and your plans. Christ declares, \"Without me ye can do nothing\"--nothing that will be approved by God. Study your motives carefully, and make sure that you are not working in your own wisdom, apart from Christ (MS 102, 1903).",
