I saw that Jesus was wounded and put to an open shame. Said the angel, as with sorrow he saw the professed people of God loving the world, partaking of the spirit of the world, and following its fashions, \"Cut loose! cut loose! lest he appoint thee thy portion with hypocrites and unbelievers outside of the City. Thy profession will only cause thee greater anguish, and thy punishment will be greater, because ye knew his will, but did it not.\" I saw that those who profess to believe the third angel's message often wound the cause of God by lightness, joking, and trifling. This evil I was shown was all through our ranks. I saw that there should be an humbling before God, and that the Israel of God should rend the heart and not the garments. Childlike simplicity is rarely seen; the approbation of man is more thought of than to fear to displease God. Said the angel, \"Set thine heart in order, lest he visit thee in judgment, and the brittle thread of life be cut, and ye lie down in the grave unsheltered, unprepared for the judgment. Or if ye do not make your bed in the grave, unless ye soon make your peace with God, tear yourselves from the world, your hearts will \n                                                                           20\ngrow harder, and ye will lean upon a false prop, a supposed preparation, and find out your mistake too late to secure a well-grounded hope.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "4bSG", "page": 19}
