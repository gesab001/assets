The Bible contains many warnings against these sins. Paul writes to Titus of those who \"profess that they know God; but in works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.\" \"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily [not openly] shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.\" The ones here referred to are not those who openly claim to have no faith in Christ, but those who profess to believe the truth and by their vileness of character bring a reproach upon it, causing it to be evil spoken of.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 144}
