{"word": "The Saviour regards with infinite tenderness the souls whom He has purchased with His blood. They are the claim of His love. He looks upon them with unutterable longing. His heart is drawn out, not only to the best-trained and most attractive children, but to those who by inheritance and through neglect have objectionable traits of character. Many parents do not understand how much they are responsible for these traits in their children. . . . Jesus looks upon these children with pity. He traces from cause to effect.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 182}
