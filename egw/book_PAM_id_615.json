{"word": "Construction\n \n\n     In building a church, money should not be spent unnecessarily, but neither should second-class work be done.--While not one penny should be expended unnecessarily in the erection of this church building, no second-class work should be done. It is planned to use the basement of the church for church-school purposes. This is right, that provision may be made by which our children can be guarded from the evils that prevail in the public schools. If this plan is carried out, the basement will have to be well finished; and this cannot be done without means.--RH May 18, 1911.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 243}
