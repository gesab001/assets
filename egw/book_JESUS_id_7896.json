{"word": "The disciples of Christ will be brought into similar positions. Unbelievers will require them to do some miracle, if they believe God's special power is in the church and that they are the chosen people of God. Unbelievers who are afflicted with infirmities will require them to work a miracle upon them, if God is with them. Christ's followers should imitate the example of their Lord. Jesus, with His divine power, did not do any mighty works for Satan's diversion. Neither can the servants of Christ. They should refer the unbelieving to the written, inspired testimony for evidence of their being the loyal people of God and heirs of salvation.--4SG 150, 151.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 15}
