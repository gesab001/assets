{"word": "\\93As we were traveling along, we met a company who were also gazing at the glories of the place. I noticed a border of red on their garments; their crowns were brilliant; their robes were pure white. As we greeted them, I asked Jesus who they were. He said they were martyrs that had been slain for him. With them was an innumerable company of little ones; they had a hem of red on their garments also. Mount Zion was just before us, and on the mount was a glorious temple, and about it were seven other mountains, on which grew roses and lilies. And I saw the little ones climb, or, if they chose, use their little wings and fly to the top of the mountains, and pluck the never-fading flowers. There were all kinds of trees around the temple to beautify the place; the box, the pine, the fir, the oil, the myrtle, the pomegranate, and the fig-tree bowed down with the weight of its timely figs,\\97 these made the place all over glorious. And as we were about to enter the holy temple, Jesus raised his lovely voice and said, \\93Only the 144,000 enter this place,\\92 and we shouted, \\91Alleluia!\\92", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LS88", "page": 217}
