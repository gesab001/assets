    "word": "The searching testimony of the Spirit of God \"will separate those from Israel who have ever been at war with the means that God has ordained to keep corruptions out of the church. Wrongs must be called wrongs. Grievous sins must be called by their right name. All of God's people should come nearer to Him. . . . Then will they see sin in the true light and will realize how offensive it is in the sight of God.\" [VOL. 3, P. 324 (1873).] \"The plain, straight testimony must live in the church, or the curse of God will rest upon His people as surely as it did upon ancient Israel because of their sins.\" [VOL. 3, P. 269 (1873).]",
