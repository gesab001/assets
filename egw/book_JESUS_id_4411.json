But we need not talk of that. Isaiah presents it this way: \"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace\" (Isaiah 9:6). Does not that say that I and My Father are one?", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 75}
