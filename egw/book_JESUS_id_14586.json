{"word": "Jesus left the royal courts of heaven, and laid aside His own glory, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might come into close connection with humanity, and by precept and example uplift and ennoble humanity, and restore in the human soul the lost image of God. This is the work of Christ; but what is the influence of those who legalize the liquor traffic? What is the influence of those who put the bottle to their neighbor's lips?

Through this business they are doing a greater work to perpetuate human woe than are men through any other business in the world. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 40}
