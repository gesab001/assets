{"word": "Though the night of sorrow gathered dark about these followers of Jesus, yet were they not forsaken. Saith the prophet: \\93When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. . . . He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.\\94 \\93Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day; the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.\\94 God hath spoken: \\93Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness.\\94 \\93I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known. I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.\\94 [Micah 7:8, 9; Psalm 139:12; 112:4; Isaiah 42:16]", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 346}
