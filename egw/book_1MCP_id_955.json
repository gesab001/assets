{"word": "Masturbation Debases the Mind. [ SEE CHILD GUIDANCE, PP. 439-468.]-- Some children begin to practice self-pollution in their infancy; and as they increase in years, the lustful passions grow with their growth and strengthen with their strength. Their minds are not at rest. Girls desire the society of boys, and boys that of the girls. Their deportment is not reserved and modest. They are bold and forward, and take indecent liberties. The habit of self-abuse has debased their minds and tainted their souls. Vile thoughts, and the reading of novels, love stories, and vile books excite their imagination, and just such suit their depraved minds.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 290}
