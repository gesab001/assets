{"word": "Chap. 58 - Soon Coming of Christ\n\n     The Preaching of the Gospel--God does not expect His workers to attend to trifling matters. They are to preach the gospel. They will find that short discourses are the most effective. In every place in which the work is begun, the standard is to be raised higher and still higher.
