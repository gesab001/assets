{"word": "Let them read of \\93the sons of the prophets\\94 (2 Kings 6:1-7), students at school, who were building a house for themselves, and for whom a miracle was wrought to save from loss the ax that was borrowed. Let them read of Jesus the carpenter, and Paul the tentmaker, who with the toil of the craftsman linked the highest ministry, human and divine. Let them read of the lad whose five loaves were used by the Savior in that wonderful miracle for the feeding of the multitude; of Dorcas the seamstress, called back from death, that she might continue to make garments for the poor; of the wise woman described in the Proverbs, who \\93seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands\\94; who \\93looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness\\94 (Proverbs 31:13, 27).\\97Education, pp. 215-217.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 234}
