{"word": "Mental Depression From Poorly Ventilated Rooms. --The effects produced by living in close, ill-ventilated rooms are these: The system becomes weak and unhealthy, the circulation is depressed, the blood moves sluggishly through the system because it is not purified and vitalized by the pure, invigorating air of heaven. The mind becomes depressed and gloomy, while the whole system is enervated, and fevers and other acute diseases are liable to be generated.--1T 702, 803 (1868).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 483}
