{"word": "The Blighting Mildew of the World (admonition to a minister who loved speculation).--You are a man who should not be a teacher of truth. You should be far in advance of where you are in experience and in the knowledge of God. You should be a man in understanding; for God has given you intellectual faculties which are susceptible of the highest cultivation. Had you divorced yourself from your speculating propensities, had you worked in the opposite direction, you would now be able to do acceptable service for God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 103}
