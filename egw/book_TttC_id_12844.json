    "word": "Let us follow the course of wisdom. Let us do nothing that will unnecessarily arouse opposition--nothing that will hinder the proclamation of the gospel message. Where demanded by custom or where greater efficiency is to be gained, let the white believers and the colored believers assemble in separate places of worship. Let us cultivate the meekness of Christ. He was the Majesty of heaven, the only-begotten Son of God. Yet \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16.",
