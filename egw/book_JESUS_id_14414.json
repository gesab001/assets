{"word": "After Jesus was nailed to the cross, it was lifted by several powerful men and thrust with great violence into the place prepared for it, causing the most excruciating agony to the Son of God. And now a terrible scene was enacted. Priests, rulers, and scribes forgot the dignity of their sacred offices, and joined with the rabble in mocking and jeering the dying Son of God, saying, \"If Thou be the King of the Jews, save Thyself.\" Luke 23:37. And some deridingly repeated among themselves, \"He saved others; Himself He cannot save.\" Mark 15:31. The dignitaries of the temple, the hardened soldiers, the vile thief upon the cross, and the base and cruel among the multitude--all united in their abuse of Christ.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 222}
