{"word": "Too Much Made of a Happy Flight of Feeling.--Some are not satisfied with a meeting unless they have a powerful and happy time. They work for this and get up an excitement of feeling. But the influence of such meetings is not beneficial. When the happy flight of feeling is gone, they sink lower than before the meeting because their \n\n40 \n\nhappiness did not come from the right source. The most profitable meetings for spiritual advancement are those which are characterized with solemnity and deep searching of heart; each seeking to know himself and earnestly, and in deep humility, seeking to learn of Christ.--1T 412 (1864).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 39}
