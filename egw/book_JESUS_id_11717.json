True and Loyal and Faithful.--[Revelation 3:4, 5 quoted.] This is the reward to be given to those who have obtained a pure and spotless character, who before the world have held fast to the faith. Jesus Christ will confess their names before the Father and before His angels. They have been true and loyal and faithful. Through evil report as well as good report they have practiced and taught the truth (MS 26, 1905).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 960}
