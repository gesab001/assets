{"word": "Man Made for Noble Purposes.--It is the true elevation of the mind, not an affectation of superiority, that makes the man. The proper cultivation of the mental powers makes man all that he is. These ennobling faculties are given to aid in forming character for the future, immortal life.

He was made in the image of God for high and noble purposes, such as engage the attention of angels.--4T 438 (1880).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 786}
