I - Life Sketches\n\n                       Childhood\n\n     I was born at Gorham, Maine, Nov. 26, 1827. My parents, Robert and Eunice Harmon, were for many years residents of this State. In early life they became earnest and devoted members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In that church they held prominent connection, and labored for the conversion of sinners, and to build up the cause of God, for a period of forty years. During this time they had the joy of seeing their children, eight in number, all converted and gathered into the fold of Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 17}
