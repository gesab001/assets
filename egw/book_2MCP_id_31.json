{"word": "You are your greatest enemy. Your wrong habits unbalance the circulation of the blood and determine [direct] the blood to the brain, and then you view everything in a perverted light. You are quick and high-tempered, and you have not cultivated self-control. Your will and your way seem right to you. But unless you see the defects in your character and wash your robe and make it white in the blood of the Lamb, you will surely fail of everlasting life. You love the theory of the truth, but you do not let it sanctify your life. You do not carry out in your daily deportment the principles of the truth you profess.--Lt 27, 1872.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 381}
