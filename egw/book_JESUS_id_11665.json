{"word": "9, 11 (see EGW on Proverbs 31:27). The Rest Obtained by Labor.-- [Hebrews 4:9, 11 quoted.] The rest here spoken of is the rest of grace, obtained by following the prescription, Labor diligently. Those who learn of Jesus His meekness and lowliness find rest in the experience of practicing His lessons. It is not in indolence, in selfish ease and pleasure-seeking, that rest is obtained. Those who are unwilling to give the Lord faithful, earnest, loving service will not find spiritual rest in this life or in the life to come. Only from earnest labor comes peace and joy in the Holy Spirit--happiness on earth and glory hereafter.", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 928}
