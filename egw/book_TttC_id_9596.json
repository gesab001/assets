    "word": "Brethren and sisters, I ask you to consider this matter carefully. Think of the wants of the fatherless and motherless. Are not your hearts stirred as you witness their sufferings? See if something cannot be done for the care of these helpless ones. As far as lies in your power, make a home for the homeless. Let everyone stand ready to act a part in helping forward this work. The Lord said to Peter: \"Feed My lambs.\" This command is to us, and by opening our homes for the orphans we aid in its fulfillment. Let not Jesus be disappointed in you.",
