    "word": "I beseech you, my brother, to become acquainted with God. \"The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.\" Ministering angels mark every step of our progress. But your will is not surrendered to God; your thoughts are not holy. \n                                                                           467\nYou go on, stumbling along in darkness, not knowing where to place your feet. The Lord reveals His will to those who are earnest and anxious to be guided. The reason for your inefficiency is that you have given up the idea of knowing and doing the will of God, therefore you do not know anything positively. Though blind yourself, you attempt to lead the blind.",
