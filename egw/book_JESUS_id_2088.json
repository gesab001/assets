{"word": "The sincere Christian appreciates the warning given by Jesus, and is a doer of His word, thus laying up his treasure in heaven, just as the world's Redeemer has told him he should do. He views an eternity of bliss worth a life of persevering and untiring effort. He is not misdirecting his efforts. He is setting his affections upon things above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Transformed by grace, his life is hid with Christ in God.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CS", "page": 158}
