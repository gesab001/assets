    "word": "Ten thousand times ten thousand may profess to obey the law and the gospel, and yet be living in transgression. Men may present in a clear manner the claims of truth upon others and yet their own hearts be carnal. Sin may be loved and practiced in secret. The truth of God may be no truth to them, because their hearts have not been sanctified by it. The love of the Saviour may exercise no constraining power over their base passions. We know by the history of the past that men may stand in sacred positions and yet handle the truth of God deceitfully. They cannot lift up holy hands to God, \"without wrath and doubting.\" This is because God has no control over their minds. The truth was never stamped upon their hearts. \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness.\" \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.\" Are you doing this? Many are not, and never have done it. Their conversion has been only superficial.",
