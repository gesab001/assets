{"word": "The apostle utters these words of warning: \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof\" (Romans 6:12). He urges us onward by telling us that \"every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things\" (1 Corinthians 9:25). He exhorts all who call themselves Christians to presents their bodies \"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God\" (Romans 12:1). He says, \"I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway\" (1 Corinthians 9:27).--2T 381 (1870).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 486}
