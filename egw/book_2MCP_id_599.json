{"word": "Character to Be Tested.--It makes every difference what material is used in the character building. The long-expected day of God will soon test every man's work. \"The fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is\" (1 Corinthians 3:13). As fire reveals the difference between gold, silver, and precious stones and wood, hay, and stubble, so the day of judgment will test characters, showing the difference between characters formed after Christ's likeness and characters formed after the likeness of the selfish heart. All selfishness, all false religion, will then appear as it is. The worthless material will be consumed; but the gold of true, simple, humble faith will never lose its value. It can never be consumed, for it is imperishable. One hour of transgression will be seen to be a great loss, while the fear of the Lord will be seen to be the beginning of wisdom. The pleasure of self-indulgence will perish as stubble, while the gold of steadfast principle, maintained at any cost, will endure forever.--RH, Dec 11, 1900. (6BC 1087, 1088.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 548}
