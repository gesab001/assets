    "word": "What has Jesus done for you, and what is He continually doing for us individually? What have you that you have not received? Said Christ: \"I am the Vine, ye are the branches.\" \"Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\" The branches do not sustain the vine, but the vine supports and nourishes the branches. The church does not support Christ, but Christ, by His vital power, supports the church. It is not enough to be a branch; we are to be fruitful branches. \"He that abideth in Me,\" said Jesus, \"and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.\" But if the fruit produced be that of the thornbush, it is evident that we are not branches of the living Vine.",
