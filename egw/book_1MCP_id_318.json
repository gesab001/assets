{"word": "Angels Take Hold of Reasoning Minds.--The heavenly angels are . . .  at work to take hold of reasoning minds, and their power is mightier than the hosts of darkness. There are minds dealing with sacred things who are not in close connection with God and who do not discern the Spirit of God. Unless His grace transforms them into the image of Christ's likeness, His Spirit will leave them as water leaves a leaky vessel. Their only hope is to seek God with all their mind, heart, and soul. Then they will lawfully strive for the mastery. Satan will steal the imagination and affections if you give him a chance.--MS 11, 1893.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 102}
