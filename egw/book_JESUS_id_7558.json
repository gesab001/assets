{"word": "Such are the words in which \"Paul the aged,\" \"a prisoner of Jesus Christ,\" writing from his prison house at Rome, endeavored to set before his brethren that which he found language inadequate to express in its fullness--\"the unsearchable riches of Christ,\" the treasure of grace freely offered to the fallen sons of men. The plan of redemption was laid by a sacrifice, a gift. Says the apostle: \"Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.\" . . . And as the crowning blessing of redemption, \"the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" . . . Surely there are none that, beholding the riches of grace, can forbear to exclaim with the apostle: \"Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 278}
