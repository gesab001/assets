    "word": "Elder Brown neither then nor afterward severed his connection with the Christian Baptist Church, but was looked upon with great respect by his people.

Heaven and earth seemed to approach each other. The meeting lasted until a late hour of the night. The power of the Lord was felt upon young, old, and middle-aged.",
