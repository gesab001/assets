{"word": "\\93Jesus saw the degradation of man, and pitied his hopeless condition. All Heaven knew that God could not change or abolish his law to save man. Jesus pitied the fallen race, and offered to take upon himself the wrath of God that was due to man, and to suffer in his stead. Said an angel, \\91Did Jesus come to make void the law of God, and by his death abolish it? No, no. If God's law could have been changed; if it could have been abolished, God would not have given his Son to die a cruel, shameful death!\\92 But the fact that Jesus gave his life for man shows the immutability of God's law. Jesus gave his life to save lost man from the curse or penalty he merited by transgression. He by humbling himself exalted man. He became the stepping-stone to elevate man, that he might lay hold of the virtue of his blood, keep God's law, and be brought back to eat of the fruit of the tree of life to which Adam and Eve forfeited all right.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LS88", "page": 340}
