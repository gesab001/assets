{"word": "Training Men and Women for Bible Work.--Elder and Mrs. Haskell were conducting Bible studies in the forenoons, and in the afternoons the workers in training were going out and visiting from house to house. These missionary visits, and the sale of many books and periodicals, opened the way for the holding of Bible readings. About forty men and women were attending the morning classes, and a goodly number of these students engaged in the afternoon work.-- Review and Herald, Nov. 29, 1906.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 470}
