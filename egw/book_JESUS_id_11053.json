{"word": "Marian, nearly the whole time I have been away I have not relished food, but I dare not cease to eat, for then I could do nothing. I have eaten when I could not relish food, in order that I might live. I have relished food since I came to this place. I put my trust in God and plead with Him for you and for myself. We are to have no anxieties or cares. Just put your trust in the Lord. All that is needed for you and me is to believe and trust in Him who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto Him and will put their trust in Him. \"Hold fast My hand,\" Jesus says to you and me. You are encouraged to think right thoughts upon Christ our Saviour--your Saviour and my Saviour. You have rejoiced in every opportunity of doing what you could to promote His glory, and you will be led into the city of God when the last trump of God shall sound, and we shall be received with genuine joy.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 252}
