{"word": "Care in Dress Not to Be Confused With Pride.-- There is a class who are continually harping upon pride and dress, who are careless of their own apparel, and who think it a virtue to be dirty, and dress without order and taste; and their clothing often looks as if it flew and lit upon their persons. Their garments are filthy, and yet such ones will ever be talking against pride. They class decency and neatness with pride.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 415}
