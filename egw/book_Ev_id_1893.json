{"word": "Not Words, but Deeds.--In regard to making known our faith no decided effort should be made to conceal it, and no unwise efforts put forth to make it prominent. Persons will come to the sanitarium who are in a favorable condition to be impressed by the truth. If they ask questions in regard to our faith, it would be proper to state what we believe, in a clear, simple manner. Indwelling godliness imparts a power to the conduct of the true believer that gives him an influence for the right.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 542}
