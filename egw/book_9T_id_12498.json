    "word": "Liberality in Missionary Effort \n\n     The Southern States are to have the light of present truth. Do not say: \"Our printing offices and our churches need more help. We need all the means that we can get to carry on the work in hand.\" One after another has shut the door to certain lines of missionary effort for fear that this work would consume means which they desired for other enterprises. My brethren, you need more of the Spirit of Christ. Let your standard be raised higher; then those who are newly converted to the truth will understand that they have a work to do. In this way the means for the carrying on of the work will be always increasing.",
