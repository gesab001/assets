{"word": "Jesus, precious Saviour, never seemed to become weary of the importunities of the sin-sick souls and the sick with all kinds of diseases. \"And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them\" (Mark 6:34). This means a great deal to the suffering ones. He identified His interest with theirs. He shared their burdens. He felt their fears. He had yearning pity that was pain to the heart of Christ.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 47}
