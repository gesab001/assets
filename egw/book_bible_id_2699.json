{"word": "The presentation of the truth in love and sympathy, from house to house, is in harmony with the instruction that Christ gave to His disciples when He sent them out on their first missionary tour. By songs of praise to God, by humble, heartfelt prayers, by a simple presentation of Bible truth in the family circle, many will be reached. The divine [Worker] will be present to send conviction to hearts. \"I am with you alway\" is His promise. With the assurance of the abiding presence of such a Helper, we may labor with hope and faith and courage.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 238}
