{"word": "My heart aches as I am shown how many there are who make self their idol. Christ has paid the redemption price for them. To Him belongs the service of all their powers. But their hearts are filled with self-love, and the desire for self-adorning. They give no thought to the words, \"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Mark 8:34). Self-gratification is hiding Christ from their view. They have no desire to walk before God in meekness and lowliness. They are not looking to Jesus. They are not praying that they may be changed into His likeness. Their cases are represented by the man who came to the king's banquet clothed in his common citizen dress. He had refused to make the preparation required by the king. The garment provided for him at great cost he disdained to wear. To the king's demand, \"How camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?\" (Matthew 22:12) he could answer nothing. He was speechless; for he was self-condemned.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 80}
