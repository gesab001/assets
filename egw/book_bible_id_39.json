{"word": "Sow in the Mind Seeds of Bible Truth.--Between an uncultivated field and an untrained mind there is a striking similarity. In the minds of children and youth the enemy sows tares, and unless parents keep watchful guard, these will spring up to bear their evil fruit. Unceasing care is needed in cultivating the soil of the mind and sowing it with the precious seed of Bible truth.

Reading that will throw light upon the Sacred Volume and quicken the desire to study it is not dangerous, but beneficial.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AH", "page": 417}
