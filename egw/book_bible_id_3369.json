{"word": "Duty in View of the Time of Trouble\n     The Lord has shown me repeatedly, that it is contrary to the Bible to make any provision for our temporal wants in the time of trouble. I saw that if the saints had food laid up by them, or in the fields, in the time of trouble, when sword, famine and pestilence are in the land, it would be taken from them by violent hands, and strangers would reap their fields. Then will be the time for us to trust wholly in God, and he will sustain us. I saw that our bread and water would be sure at that time, and we should not lack or suffer hunger; for God was able to spread a table for us in the wilderness. And if necessary, he \n45\nwould send ravens to feed us as he did to feed Elijah, or rain manna from heaven, as he did for the Israelites.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ExV", "page": 44}
