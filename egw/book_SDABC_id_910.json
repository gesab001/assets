    "word": "8. No Solitude Without God.--The psalmist represents the presence of the Infinite One as pervading the universe. \"If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; \n                                                                           1154\nif I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.\" [Psalm 139:8.] We can never find a solitude where God is not. The ever watchful eye of Omniscience is upon all our works, and although He can marshal the armies of heaven to do His will, He condescends to accept the services of frail, erring mortals (ST July 14, 1881).",
