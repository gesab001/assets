{"word": "\"DEAR BROTHER: IN ALABAMA THE CONFERENCE OFFICERS ARE MUCH PERPLEXED ABOUT THE CASE OF WILLIAM E, AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WRITE FOR A COPY OF WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN [BY ELLEN WHITE] BEARING UPON HIS PUBLIC LABOR AS A MINISTER, AND ALSO FOR PRESENT ADVICE, OR INSTRUCTION FROM THE LORD. YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH HIS PAST. HIS LIFE HAS BEEN STRAIGHT SO FAR AS IS KNOWN FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND HE HAS SOLD BOOKS AND BIBLES. BUT HE FEELS A BURDEN TO PREACH AND WHEREVER HE GOES HE SOON HAS OPPORTUNITY TO PREACH. HE HAS WONDERFUL ABILITY AND SOON THERE IS AN INTEREST. HE GIVES OUTWARD EVIDENCE OF DEEP CONSECRATION AND PEOPLE ACCEPT THE TRUTH UNDER HIS LABORS.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSB", "page": 228}
