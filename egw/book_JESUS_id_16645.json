{"word": "Jesus says, \"I know my sheep.\" Let us consider this statement. We are known by God before we receive Him. \"I know my sheep.\" How do souls become Christ's sheep? By choosing to receive Him. But Christ had first chosen them. He knew every one who would respond to His drawing, and He knew every one who would be inclined to receive Him but who, through popular opposing influences, would turn from Him, John says to all, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). Those who heard the voice and did behold Jesus as the Lamb of God believed in Him and became His property from their own choice. But . . . their choosing of Christ was in response to His drawing. The love of Jesus was expressed to us before we loved Him. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 52}
