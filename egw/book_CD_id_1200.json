You have used the fat of animal which God in His word expressly forbids: \"It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.\" \"Moreover, ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
