    "word": "Avoid False Standards \n\n     While we would caution you not to overeat, even of the best quality of food, we would also caution those that are extremists not to raise a false standard and then endeavor to bring everybody to it. There are some who are starting out as health reformers who are not fit to engage in any other enterprise, and who have not sense enough to take care of their own families or keep their proper place in the church. And what do they do? Why, they fall back as health-reform physicians, as though they could make that a success. They assume the responsibilities of their practice and take the lives of men and women into their hands, when they really know nothing about the business.--Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, pp. 374, 375 (1869).",
