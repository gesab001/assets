    "word": "When a man is struggling with honest endeavor to sustain himself and his family, and yet is unable to do this, so that they suffer for necessary food and clothing, the Lord will not pronounce our ministering brethren guiltless, if they look on with indifference or prescribe conditions for this brother, which are virtually impossible of fulfillment. Now I have had so many of these cases urged by the Lord upon my notice that I dare not pass them by and go over on the other side of the road, as did the priest and Levite, making no decided effort \n                                                                           1270\nto change the condition of things. The instruction given by our Lord is essential for every Christian to practice as well as to preach. \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" We are to make the condition of the unfortunate brother our own.",
