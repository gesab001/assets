    "word": "Money matters are very close and it is not a little perplexing how to manage to make the shillings and pounds [in Australia] go the longest way and accomplish the most good. I dismissed my workers a couple of weeks ago, and took on another company of workers who were verily destitute of food to eat and clothing to wear. One, Brother Parcles (?) by name, had taken a little fruit farm, to raise peas and vegetables also, but the frost cut off his peas. I gave him a cow. Until he has fruit for sale he will not have anything coming in. I learned the family were reduced so that they had lived only on squash for several days. I told him to come and I would give him work in making garden, putting in seed. This man has a wife converted from the Catholics, a fine, intelligent woman, a dressmaker. He was a sewing machine agent. They have four children to care for and very nice children they are. I cannot let this family be distressed for food and clothing. I sent my hired man, my horses, and plow, and he broke up the land for them. It took him about one week to do this.--Letter 156, 1896, p. 2.
