    "word": "A Dunkard preacher bore an excellent testimony. One white-headed man bore testimony that he thought he was not able to come to the meeting, but when he read in the \n\n\n                                     -208- \n\npaper that Elder Van Horn and Sister White were to be present he thought he must come. He came one hundred and forty miles on horseback and on foot. He had not heard an Advent sermon for six years. The meeting he had had that day was precious indeed. The discourse he had listened to from Sister White would be food for him a long time. He was well paid for his journey if he received no more. Said he could not stay but a few days but must return home. In going and coming, this man in feeble health, would travel two hundred and eighty miles to hear two or three discourses.",
