    "word": "Sense, Common, Philosophy of, More Value Than Ancient Languages.--The philosophy of common sense is of far more consequence to the youth than the study of Greek and Latin. The brain is used too much like the abused stomach. It receives a great amount of food which it cannot take care of, and the result is that Satan comes in, with his temptations and sows the seeds and causes ideas of infidelity, which the students have received from their study books in school education, to become a matter of great interest. A bewitching power holds the intellect, and works it until it becomes a fruitful field of tares, a curse in the place of a blessing.--Ms 11, 1898. \n\n\n                                     -359-",
