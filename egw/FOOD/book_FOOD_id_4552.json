    "word": "We have seen those who advocated health reform who made grave mistakes in the preparation of their food. Some prepared porridge for every meal, and insisted upon the students partaking of it in the school, or, when in charge of a family, compel the children to eat of this dish. But soft food is not always the best food for all persons. Some children have been forced by their parents to eat porridge when they loathed the very sight of it, and have been told that unless they ate the porridge, they could have neither fruit nor any other dish on the table. Such treatment will not help the children to understand the principles of health reform. That which is wholesome food for some is unpalatable and unwholesome for others. Why is it necessary to make a certain dish a staple article of diet when it is not grateful to the taste or beneficial to health? Why not vary the provision, and make a healthful and pleasant change? It is not just or wise to compel anyone to eat that which is distasteful.",
