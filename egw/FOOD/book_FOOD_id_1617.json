    "word": "A Specious Offer\n     Since daylight I have written eleven pages in regard to the manufacture and sale of flake foods on the Pacific Coast. Dr. Kellogg and his brother offer to sell for forty-five thousand dollars, the right to manufacture \n83\nand sell corn flakes in a certain section. The light given me is that we are not to accept this offer. Neither the territory nor the knowledge regarding health foods belongs to Dr. Kellogg. This is the Lord's talent. He has not made it over to any man, to be handled as his own property and invention, and to speculate upon for his own benefit. It has not been given to any man to be used to oppress his fellow-men.",
