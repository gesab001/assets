    "word": "Christ Works From Within.--Men will never be truly temperate until the grace of Christ is an abiding principle in the heart. . . . Circumstances cannot work reform.

The plan of beginning outside and trying to work inward has always failed, and always will fail.--Counsels on Diet and Foods, page 35.",
