    "word": "The health of the body is to be regarded as essential for the advancement of growth in grace, an even temper. If food is given to the stomach which will prove a tax to it, it will surely result in perverting the finer feelings of the heart. The stomach has a controlling influence upon the whole being, and has everything to do with the health of the whole body. If the stomach is not properly cared for, the formation of a moral character will be hindered. The brain and nerves are in sympathy with the stomach. Erroneous eating and drinking will result in erroneous thinking and acting.--Ms 113, 1898, p. 3. (\"Present Your Bodies a Living Sacrifice,\" September 8, 1898.)",
