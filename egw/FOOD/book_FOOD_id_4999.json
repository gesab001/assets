    "word": "When I hear those who profess to believe the truth for this time pleading for the use of flesh meats, I am forcibly reminded of the complainings of the children of Israel because they were not favored with a meat diet. The diet of animals generally used for food is vegetables and grains. Must the vegetables be animalized before we can eat them? Must they be incorporated into the system of an animal before we can digest them? Must we obtain our vegetable diet by eating the flesh of dead creatures? God provided fruit in its natural state for our first parents. He gave Adam charge of the garden to dress it and to care for it, saying, \"To you it shall be for meat.\" The plan was not for one animal to destroy another animal for food. After the fall, the eating of flesh was suffered in order to shorten the period of the existence of the long-lived race. It was allowed because of the hardness of the hearts of men. One of the great errors that many insist upon is, that muscular strength is dependent upon animal food. But the simple grains, fruits of the trees, and vegetables have all the nutritive properties necessary to make good blood. This a flesh diet cannot do.",
