WHITE REGARDING THE NEW WAHROONGA SANITARIUM, NEAR SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, UNDER ELDER BURDEN'S MANAGEMENT; THE DEVELOPING OF A HEALTH-FOOD AND BAKERY WORK IN THE ENVIRONS OF SYDNEY; AND THE POSSIBLE MOVING OF THE HEALTH-FOOD MANUFACTURING BEING DONE AT COORANBONG, 75 MILES NORTH, TO SYDNEY. ELLEN WHITE IN SEVERAL LETTERS CAUTIONED AGAINST BURDEN'S TAKING ON TOO MANY BURDENS, WARNED AGAINST DEBT, AND COUNSELED DELAY IN THE MATTER OF ANY PROPOSED MOVE OF THE FOOD FACTORY. ON DECEMBER 10, 1902, ELLEN WHITE PENNED A LETTER WHICH FOR SOME REASON WAS NOT COPIED UNTIL JANUARY 27, 1903, AND HENCE IS IN THE 1903 FILE. COPIES WERE SENT NOT ONLY TO THE BURDENS BUT ALSO TO DR. D. H. KRESS, ELDERS G. B. STARR, E. W. FARNSWORTH, S. N. HASKELL, AND J. E. WHITE. PORTIONS OF THIS LETTER HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN USED, BUT WITH THIS BACKGROUND FOR THE STUDY OF THE QUESTION IN DEPTH, WE GIVE THE LETTER IN FULL.]",
