    "word": "Food, Benefits of, Not Determined by Quantity.--The quantity of food eaten does not determine the benefit received. Many, even among Seventh-day Adventists, eat too freely. Their health would be much better if they ate less. When too much food is eaten, the stomach is overburdened, and is unable to perform its proper functions. The result is that the digestive organs are disordered. If those who have brought themselves to this condition would eat proper food, and only about half as much as they have been in the habit of eating, their digestive organs would recover.--Letter 82, 1903.",
