    "word": "We have been filled with pain of heart, which language can not describe, as we have seen feature after feature of the work that should have been conducted in the purest channels as a means of bringing souls to a knowledge of the truth, corrupted by ambition and commercialism. Thus some features of the health work have proved a snare to capture talents of influence that might have been used in feeding souls with the bread of life. While thousands are perishing without a knowledge of the truth, while multitudes have not the bread of life to feed upon, while God is calling for a quick work to be done to prepare a people for the coming of Christ, shall our hygienic restaurants prove a snare, by being operated merely for commercial advantage, and their influence extend no farther? It was hoped that much good would be done by preparing food for worldlings, that thereby many would be brought to a knowledge of the truth. And this might have been, had the glory of God been kept in view. But these enterprises have been run so largely on a commercial basis, for the temporal advantages to be gained, that they have often become a snare, as it were, to hold men and women of talent, who, by study and diligent effort, could do acceptable service in the winning of souls to Christ. The end of all things is at hand. We must learn to fulfill God's purposes. Let no one delay.",
