Let centers of influence be made in many Southern cities by the opening of food stores and vegetarian restaurants. Let there also be facilities for the manufacture of simple, inexpensive health foods. But let not selfish, worldly policy be brought into the work; for God forbids this. Let unselfish men take hold of this work in the fear of God, and with love for their fellow-men.",
