    "word": "[PRAYER BY BRETHREN MCCLURE AND W. C. WHITE] \n\n     W. C. WHITE: IF I UNDERSTAND THE MATTER CORRECTLY, WE HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT THE LORD WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE US MAKE THE HEALTH FOOD BUSINESS A GREAT MISSIONARY AGENCY, A MEANS OF REACHING THE PEOPLE WITH THE TRUTHS AND REFORMS OF THIS GENERATION. TO DO THIS, WE MUST REACH OUT AND ESTABLISH THE BUSINESS IN AS MANY LOCALITIES AS WE CAN. AS A MATTER OF FIRST IMPORTANCE IS TO BRING RIGHT PRINCIPLES OF DEALING INTO OUR HOME WORK, SO THAT OUR EMPLOYEES SHALL BE TRAINED ARIGHT AND BE ENABLED TO DEVELOP CHRISTIAN CHARACTER, SO THAT WHEN THEY GO OUT THEY MAY CORRECTLY REPRESENT A CHRISTIAN ENTERPRISE.",
