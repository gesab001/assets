    "word": "410. Food should not be washed down; no drink is needed with meals. Eat slowly, and allow the saliva to mingle with the food. The more liquid there is taken into the stomach with the meals, the more difficult it is for the food to digest; for the liquid must be first absorbed. . . . Hot drinks are debilitating; and besides, those who indulge in their use become slaves to the habit. . . . Do not eat largely of salt; give up bottled pickles; keep fiery spiced food out of your stomach; eat fruit with your meals, and the irritation which calls for so much drink will cease to exist. But if anything is needed to quench thirst, pure water, drunk some little time before or after a meal, is all that nature requires. . . . Water is the best liquid possible to cleanse the tissues.-- R. and H., 1884, No. 31.",
