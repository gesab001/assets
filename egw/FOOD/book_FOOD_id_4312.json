    "word": "I saw that the workers in the cause need now to be wide awake. Many need to be converted anew and rebaptized. When they learn to drink of the Spiritual Rock which followed the army of Israel in the wilderness, when they partake daily of the heavenly manna, how their experience will change! What the food we eat is to our physical needs, Christ is to our spiritual necessities. He is the Bread of life. \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood,\" Christ declared, \"ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth His flesh and drinketh His blood, hath eternal life. When Christ is formed within the soul, His presence will be as a well of water, springing up unto everlasting life.--Letter 332, 1907, pp. 1, 2. (To the Workers in Nashville, October 9, 1907.) \n\nReleased March 16, 1976.",
