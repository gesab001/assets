    "word": "A telegram was received in regard to our trunks and the conductor insisted on my telegraphing back to you, while he would telegraph to the parties in San Francisco. I knew it was not the least use to telegraph [you], for you must know the trunks were not on the train. He insisted on our going into the baggage car. They got a chair and we climbed up and found no trunks of ours. Then he telegraphed. The agent said he must punch my tickets or baggage would not be sent; the conductor said I must not get my tickets punched until the telegraph should notify us the trunks were on the way. But the agent said he was mistaken, so my tickets are punched. We have plenty of room, good food and plenty of it. Sister McComber scalded up the chicken. Will scald the meat tomorrow morning. We arrive at Ogden at seven tomorrow. I wish you had told me just how far you had paid for a sleeper; sleeping car conductor says [it was] only [paid] to Ogden, so we must go through that process of securing tickets in the Ogden depot. I shall get the porter to do this for me. \n\n\n                                     -148-",
