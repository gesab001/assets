    "word": "The question of diet should be patiently studied. We need knowledge and wise judgment, in order to move wisely in this matter. Nature's laws should not be resisted, but obeyed. The health should receive careful attention. Some conscientiously abstain from eating improper food, and at the same time fail to eat food that supplies the elements necessary for the proper sustenance of the body. Never bear a testimony against health reform by failing to supply wholesome, palatable food to take the place of the harmful articles of diet we have discarded.",
