    "word": "7 T.--133-134 \n     In the use of foods, we should exercise good, sound common sense. When we find that a certain food does not agree with us, we need not write letters of inquiry to learn the cause of the disturbance. Change the diet; use less of some foods; try other preparations.

As intelligent human beings, let us individually study the principles, and use our experience and judgment in deciding what foods are best for us.",
