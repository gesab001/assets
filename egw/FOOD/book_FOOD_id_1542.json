    "word": "The Lord desires us to be wise to resist the evil and discern the good. God has been giving me instruction that He will give men in various countries ability to produce healthful foods, so that the human machinery can be kept in good order without the use of any food which contains injurious properties. By His Holy Spirit the Lord will guide His workers in the preparation of foods. And the profits from these foods are not to be used merely for the benefit of the sanitariums. God builds no such partition walls. These profits are to be used for the good of suffering humanity everywhere.",
