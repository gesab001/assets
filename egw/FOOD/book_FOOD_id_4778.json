    "word": "The Lord had food whereby his servants might become enlarged and grow to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. What is the chaff to the full kernels of wheat? How great was my burden in that tent, \n                                                                           57\nin my feebleness that night! I know that the Lord was graciously willing to forgive sins and pardon the sinner, and my heart was stirred with an intensity of desire that all upon the camp-ground should see the salvation of the Lord. To this people, God had committed sacred trusts. He had made them repositories of light in regard to his law, and should Christ say of these highly favored, \"Ye are both ignorant of the Scriptures and of the honor of God.\" Should those who made so high a profession, because of their want of pure and undefiled religion, dishonor the world's Redeemer by their unconsecrated lives? \"Ye are my witnesses\" saith the Lord. Should the people of God remain in a backslidden state, unconsecrated, unholy in life and in character? How then could Christ say of them, \"Ye are the light of the world\", and represent them as a city that is set upon a hill, or a light upon a candlestick, giving light to all that are in the house?",
