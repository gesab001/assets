    "word": "Chapter 2 \u2014Our Need Of Prayer\n\nPRAYER IS AS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE AS DAILY FOOD.\u2014Daily prayer is as essential to growth in grace, and even to spiritual life itself, as is temporal food to physical well-being. We should accustom ourselves to often lift the thoughts to God in prayer. If the mind wanders, we must bring it back; by persevering effort, habit will finally make it easy. We cannot for one moment separate ourselves from Christ with safety. We may have His presence to attend us at every step, but only by observing the conditions which He has Himself laid down.\u2014(Messages to Young People, 115.)",
