    "word": "From Christ's answer we may draw a lesson that we should learn. He is not unmindful of the physical wants of His followers. He will provide food to satisfy bodily necessities. But He teaches us that the spiritual food which He provides is of far more consequence to us than is temporal food. He teaches us to have far more anxiety to secure the living bread that endureth unto eternal life, than to secure perishable bread for physical sustenance. He teaches us that the bread from heaven can be obtained from no human agent. Through the gift of Christ, God Himself gives to man this living bread. \"For the bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto Him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.\"",
