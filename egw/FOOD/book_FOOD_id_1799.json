    "word": "Salvation was brought to us at great self-denial and infinite cost by the Son of God. Some have followed his example, and have not let farms, or pleasant homes, or even loved ones, stand in their way. They have left all for Christ. But I am grieved and astonished that there are so few who have the real missionary spirit at this time. The end so near, the warning of a soon-coming Judgment yet to be given to all nations, tongues, and peoples, yet where are the men who are willing to make any and every sacrifice to get the truth before the world? Some who do go forth as missionaries are so grieved to leave the things they love that they keep in a state of sorrow and depression, and one-half of their usefulness is destroyed. They are not called to go among heathen or savages, to suffer for food or clothing, nor are they deprived of even the conveniences of life; and yet they look upon themselves as martyrs. Such are not bold soldiers of the cross of Christ. They do not give him willing service.",
