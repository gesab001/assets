    "word": "To those who are bearing burdens in Nashville, I would say: You are now to seek diligently to learn lessons that you have not yet learned. All have a work to do in self-training. The Lord now gives you an opportunity to reveal a spirit of self-sacrifice in behalf of his cause. Let all our brethren and sisters in responsibility in Nashville, and especially those who are connected as workers with the Nashville Sanitarium, humble their hearts before God, and pray for the prosperity of the sanitarium. Let those having the work in charge, study to avoid all waste and extravagance and all unnecessary expenditure. Let them see that everything is carried on wisely and economically; for they are dealing with the Lord's goods. Nothing \n                                                                           33\nthat can be utilized should be thrown away. This will require wisdom, and forethought, and constant care. It has been presented to me that the inability to save, in little things, is one reason why so many families suffer for lack of the necessities of life. With many, there is a want of knowledge as to how to prepare food in economical ways.",
