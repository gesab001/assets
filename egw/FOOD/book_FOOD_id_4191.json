    "word": "Life, No, Without Light.--Did God speak but one word, you would at once be still in death. Day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, God works by His infinite power to keep you alive. It is He who supplies the air which keeps life in the body. Should God neglect man as man neglects God, what would become of the race? Without fresh air to breathe, the lungs, the avenues of life, would be clogged. The food would be a minister of evil, and death would result.--Ms 50, 1901.",
