    "word": "You have too little care and feel too lightly the burden of providing an orderly, ample repast for your workers. They are the ones who need an abundance of fresh, wholesome provision. They are constantly taxed: their vitality must be preserved. Their principles should be educated. They, of all in the Sanitarium should be abundantly furnished with the best and most wholesome strength-giving food. The table of your helpers should be furnished not with meat, but with an abundant supply of good fruit, grains, and vegetables, prepared in a nice, wholesome way. Your neglect to do this has increased your income at altogether an expense to the strength and souls of your workers. This has not pleased the Lord. The influence of the entire fare does not recommend your principles to those that sit at the helpers' tables. If they are worthy to compose your family, they are worthy of the very best and most strength-giving diet, that seeds may not be planted in their breasts which will germinate and bring forth a harvest to the dishonor of God. But this has been done: and this must have attention. Equality must be practiced as well as talked.",
