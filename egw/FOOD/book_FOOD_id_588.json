You must not go to extremes either in your own case or in regard to the food provided \n                                                                           207\nfor the helpers and the patients at the sanitarium. The patients pay a good price for their board, and they should have liberal fare. Some may come to the sanitarium in a condition demanding stern denial of appetite and the simplest fare, but as their health improves, they should be liberally supplied with nourishing food. \n     [SANITARIUMS TO AVOID EXTREMES IN DIET.--427, 428, 429]",
