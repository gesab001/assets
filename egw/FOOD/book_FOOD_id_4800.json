    "word": "Battle Creek, January 29, 1891 \n\n     The past night was one of great suffering. I slept but little. The malaria is upon me. I was nauseated at the sight of food. Could sit up but a short period at a time. My repaired lounge came home the day before, so it was very convenient for me. Oh how I long for strength! Elder Waggoner called and was very urgent that I should speak again to the ministerial class.",
