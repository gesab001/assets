    "word": "Many are made sick by the indulgence of their appetite. They eat what suits their perverted taste, thus weakening the digestive organs and injuring their power to assimilate the food that is to sustain life. So many varieties are introduced into the stomach that fermentation is the result. This condition brings on acute disease, and death frequently follows. Sin indeed lies at the door. The door is the mouth, and the stomach is made to do at one meal the work of two or three meals. Thus the delicate machinery is worn out by the suicidal practices of those who ought to know better.",
