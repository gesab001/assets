    "word": "We went to the city Sunday night. I spoke to quite a large congregation of outsiders with acceptance, taking up the subject of the loaves and fishes with which Jesus, by His miraculous power, fed about ten thousand people-- five thousand men and women and five thousand children--that were continually collecting, after the Saviour had blessed the small portion of food; Christ walking on the sea, and the Jews requiring a sign that He was the Son of God. The neighbor next to the church near the public garden was there. Cragg, I believe his name is. They all listened with wide open eyes and some open mouths.

She seemed deeply interested. . . .",
