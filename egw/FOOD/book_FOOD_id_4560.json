    "word": "When our trees were first planted, we had no rain for many months, but with careful attention they nearly all lived. During the past season, while the countries [country areas] around us have been without rain, we have had all we needed. We visited Melbourne the last of February, and after we had passed a few stations near Sydney, the whole country presented a charred and burned appearance. They had had no rain, and everywhere the cattle were suffering for water and food. In Melbourne the cattle were poor and the paddocks almost without a green thing in them. All through Victoria was this drought felt; but this country has had showers when needed; the grass is green, and everything is pleasant to the eye. We thank the Lord that we are located just where we are, and that we have been blessed by Him.",
