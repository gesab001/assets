    "word": "As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual life is sustained by the word of God. And every soul is to receive life from God's word for himself.

From the Scriptures there is the very instruction you need. \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me\" (John 5:39).",
