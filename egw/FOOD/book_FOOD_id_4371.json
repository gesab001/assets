    "word": "To eat and to drink that which is not agreeable to them is not wisdom. And again, be sure and set before them the very food you desire they shall eat. That which is of a healthful quality of food for them is healthful for you, but the quantity of even healthful food should be carefully studied, not to introduce into the stomach too large a quantity at one meal. We must ourselves be temperate in all things, if we would give the proper lessons to our children. When they are older any inconsideration on your part is marked.--Letter 12, 1884, pp. 3, 4. (To Brother and Sister Brownsberger, 1884.)",
