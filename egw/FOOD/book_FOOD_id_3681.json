    "word": "Those upon whom rest important responsibilities, those, above all, who are guardians of spiritual interests, should be men of keen feeling and quick perception. More than others, they need to be temperate in eating. Rich and luxurious food should have no place upon their tables.  {TSDF 157.10}  \n     Every day men in positions of trust have decisions to make upon which depend results of great importance. . . . Often they have to think rapidly, and this can be done successfully by those only who practice strict temperance. Here is a suggestion for all whose work is sedentary or chiefly mental; let those who have sufficient moral courage and self-control try it: At each meal take only two \n\n158 \n\nor three kinds of simple food, and eat no more than is required to satisfy hunger. Take active exercise every day, and see if you do not receive benefit.  {TSDF 157.11}  \n     Strong men who are engaged in active physical labor are not compelled to be as careful as to the quantity or quality of their food as are persons of sedentary habits; but even these would have better health if they would practice self-control in eating and drinking.",
