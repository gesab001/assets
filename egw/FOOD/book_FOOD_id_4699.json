    "word": "I have received letters from New Zealand in which the writers stated that nut foods do not agree with them. I did not know just how to answer these letters.

The combination is not correct when nuts are cooked with other food, and that some nuts are not as wholesome as others. These experiments must not be too certainly recommended, but experiment and move carefully. [Unless this is done], using this nut food will do harm. A reform must be made in the matter of health foods.",
