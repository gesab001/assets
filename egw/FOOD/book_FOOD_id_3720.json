    "word": "U. T., Aug. 30, '96 (H. L. para. 685) \n     Nearly all the members of the human family eat more than the system requires. This excess decays and becomes a putrid mass. . . .

The system makes desperate efforts to dispose of it, and this extra work causes a tired feeling. Some who are continually eating call this \"all gone\" feeling hunger, but it is caused by the overworked condition of the abused digestive organs.",
