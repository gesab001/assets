    "word": "Three years ago a letter came to me saying, \u201cI cannot eat the nut foods; my stomach cannot take care of them.\u201d Then there were several recipes presented before me; one was that there must be other ingredients combined with the nuts, which would harmonize with them, and not use such a large proportion of nuts. One-tenth to one-sixth part of nuts would be sufficient, varied according to combination. We tried this, and with success. Other things were mentioned. One thing spoken of was sweetened crackers or biscuit. They are made because someone likes them, and then many obtain them who should not eat them. There are yet many improvements to be made, and God will work with all who will work with Him. -Letter 188, 1901. Written December 30, 1901.",
