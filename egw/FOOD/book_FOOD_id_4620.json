    "word": "Said the angel, \"Jesus has nearly finished His work in the sanctuary. It is no time to be stupid now. A quick work will the Lord do upon the earth. The four angels will soon let go the four winds.\" Said the angel, \"Beware how thou treadest enchanted ground all around the east and west, north and south. If \n\n\n                                    -12- \n\nSatan can get thee to slumber now, he is sure of his prey.\" I saw [that] some in Israel had been half starved for food, and when the present truth was presented to them they ate it with thankfulness and gratitude like half-starved children. Said the angel, \"Can ye stand in the battle in the day of the Lord? Ye need to be washed, and live in newness of life.\" Then I saw [that] those whose hands are now engaged in making up the breach and are standing in the gaps, but that have formally since '44 broken the commandments of God and have so far followed the pope as to keep the first day instead of the seventh, would have to go down into the water and be baptized in the faith of the shut door and keeping the commandments of God, and in the faith of Jesus [who is] coming to sit on the throne of His father David, and to redeem Israel. I also saw [that] those who have been baptized as a door into the professed churches will have to be baptized out of that door again, and into the faith mentioned above; and all who have not been baptized since '44 will have to be baptized before Jesus comes, and some will not gain progress now until that duty is done, and then they must live anew unto God and serve Him faithfully.",
