    "word": "Now I want that just as long as Willie's children [AGES: HENRY AND HERBERT, TWINS, 7 YEARS; GRACE, 3 YEARS. IN TIME, ALL ATTENDED THIS SCHOOL.] are here, and they live here, I want they should have the discipline of a school. If it can be connected with this school by putting on an addition to the building, one room say, for such students, every one of us ought to feel a responsibility to provide that room. Those mothers that want to keep their children at home, and are fully competent and would prefer to discipline them herself, why, no one has any objection to that. They can do that. But provision is to be made so that the children of all who have any connection with this food factory and sanitarium and these things that are being carried on here, should be educated. We must have it stand to reach the highest standards.",
