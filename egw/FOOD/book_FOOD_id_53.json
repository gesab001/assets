    "word": "Simplicity in Cooking \n\n     Greater efforts should be put forth to educate the people in the principles of health reform. More cooking schools should be established, and some should labor from house to house giving instruction in the art of cooking wholesome food. Parents and their children should learn to cook more simply than is usually done. The preparation of so many varied and complex dishes so absorbs the time and attention of many that they are disqualified to teach the truth as it is in Jesus.--Letter 279, 1905.",
