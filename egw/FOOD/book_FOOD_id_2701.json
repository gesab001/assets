    "word": "Proper Course at the Tables of Others--a Word to Colporteur Evangelists.--If you sit at their table, eat temperately, and only of food that will not confuse the mind. Keep yourself from all intemperance. Be yourself an object lesson, illustrating right principles. If they offer you tea to drink, tell them in simple words its injurious effect on the system.-- Manuscript 23, 1890.",
