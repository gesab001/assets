    "word": "I was shown the course of H. S. Giddings in his own family. He has been severe and overbearing. He adopted the health reform, as advocated by Bro. Miller, and, like him, took extreme views of the subject, and not having a well-balanced mind, he has made \n                                                                           6\nterrible blunders, the results of which time will not efface. He commenced to carry out the theory he had heard advocated by Bro. Miller, aided by items gathered from books. He made a point, like Bro. Miller, of bringing all up to the standard he had erected. He brought his own family to his rigid rules, but failed to control his own animal propensities. He failed here to bring himself to the mark, and to keep his body under.

His own unsubdued passions had borne sway, without reasoning from cause to effect. Before the birth of his children he did not treat his wife as a woman in her condition should be treated. He carried out rigid rules for her, according to Bro. Miller's ideas, which proved a great injury to her. He did not provide the quality and quantity of food that was necessary to nourish two lives instead of one.

Her children were born with feeble nutritive powers, and impoverished blood. The mother, from the food she was compelled to receive, could not furnish a good quality of blood, and she gave birth to children filled with humors.",
