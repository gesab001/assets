    "word": "The showbread was kept ever before the Lord as a perpetual offering. . . . It was called showbread, or \"bread of the presence,\" because it was ever before the face of the Lord. It was an acknowledgment of man's dependence upon God for both temporal and spiritual food, and that it is received only through the mediation of Christ. . . . Both the manna and the showbread pointed to Christ, the living bread, who is ever in the presence of God for us.",
