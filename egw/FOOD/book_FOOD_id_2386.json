    "word": "If parents or children eat frequently, irregularly, and in too great quantities, even of the most healthful food, it will injure the constitution; but in addition to this, if the food is of an improper quality, and prepared with grease and indigestible spices, the result will be far more injurious. The digestive organs will be severely taxed, and exhausted nature will be left a poor chance to rest, and recover strength, and the vital organs soon become impaired, and break down. If care and regularity is considered needful for dumb animals, it is as much more essential for human beings, formed in the image of their Maker, as they are of more value than the dumb creation.",
