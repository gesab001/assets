    "word": "To the \"Little Flock\"\n\n\n     Dear Brethren: The Lord gave me a view, January 26, 1850, which I will relate. I saw that some of the people of God are stupid and dormant and but half awake; they do not realize the time we are now living in, and that the man with the \"dirt brush\" [SEE \"WILLIAM MILLER'S DREAM,\" PAGE 81.] has entered, and that some are in danger of being swept away. I begged of Jesus to save them, to spare them a little longer, and let them see their awful danger, that they might get ready before it should be forever too late. \n                                                                           49\nThe angel said, \"Destruction is coming like a mighty whirlwind.\" I begged of the angel to pity and to save those who loved this world, who were attached to their possessions and were not willing to cut loose from them and sacrifice to speed the messengers on their way to feed the hungry sheep who were perishing for want of spiritual food.",
