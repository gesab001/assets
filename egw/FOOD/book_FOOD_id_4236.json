    "word": "Close by us was a large rock running up abruptly from the road, but in the rear was a platte of level ground which, without much difficulty, would bring one to the top of the huge rock.

The name of this place was Laufen, fourteen miles from Basel. Sara McEnterfer prepared the luncheon, which is spread upon the ground upon smooth Manila paper used as a tablecloth. The blessing of God is asked upon our food, and the simple lunch is eaten with a relish.",
