Cease your unbelieving worry. When the anxious disciples saw the hungry multitudes beside the sea, impossibilities arose in their minds, and they questioned, \"Shall we go to the villages and buy, to give them to eat?\" Just so in the several conferences many now ask. Shall we send to Battle Creek for some one to come and hold meetings with us and revive us and feed us? What said Christ?--No. He commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass in companies of fifty and one hundred. They obeyed orders, seating themselves in long lines on the grass. Jesus took the five loaves and two fishes out of the hands of the lad, and looking up to his Father he asked his blessing upon the meager supply. Then he put into the hands of his disciples the food to be distributed. The scanty provision grew under the hand of Christ, and he had constantly a fresh supply for his servants to distribute to the hungry multitude, until all \n\n\n                       - 31 - \n\nhad a sufficiency. Then the word came, \"Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost.\"There was a surplus of food gathered up.",
