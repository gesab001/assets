    "word": "The only safe course is to cut down expenses, to dispense with delicacies and great variety, and be content with simple food, simply prepared. We should make it a principle not to aim at the world's standard. The precious talent of means should not be squandered to gain the praise of men. We should be content with the honor which comes from above. God hates the pride, the lust, the ambition, which have a controlling power in the world today, and which are fast gaining control of the Sanitarium.",
