    "word": "2 T.--432 \n     Sister R is in poor health. She indulges her appetite and places too heavy a burden upon her stomach. She burdens it by overeating, and by placing in it a quality of food not best calculated to nourish her system. Her food is taken in immoderate quantities and she takes but little exercise; thus the system is severely taxed. According to the light which the Lord has given us, simple food is the best to insure health and strength. Exercise is necessary to her health.",
