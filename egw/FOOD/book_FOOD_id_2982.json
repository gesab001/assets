    "word": "The strength and joy of benefiting humanity lie not in expensive buildings. We must remember how many are suffering for want of necessary food and clothing. In erecting buildings we should not be influenced by a desire for appearance. We should do our duty, and \n                                                                           61\nleave the results with God who only can give success. Let any extra means that we may have be spent in providing proper health-restoring facilities. Let all our sanitariums be erected for health and happiness; let them be so located that the patients will have the blessing of the sunlight; let them be so arranged that every unnecessary step will be saved.",
