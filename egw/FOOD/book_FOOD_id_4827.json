    "word": "It is best for every soul to closely investigate what mental food is served up for them to eat. When those come to you who live to talk and who are all armed and equipped to say, \"Report, and we will report it,\" stop and think if the conversation will give spiritual help, spiritual efficiency, that in spiritual communication you may eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God, \"to whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious.\" These words express much. We are not to be tattlers, or gossipers or tale bearers; we are not to bear false witness. We are forbidden by God to engage in trifling, foolish conversation, in jesting, in joking, or speaking any idle words. We must give an account of what we say to God. We will be brought into judgment for our hasty words, that do no good to the speaker or the hearer. Then let us all speak words that will tend to edification. Remember that you are of value with God. Allow no cheap, foolish talk, or wrong principles to compose your Christian experience.",
