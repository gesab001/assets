    "word": "In the field in which you are working [Australia], there is much to be learned regarding the preparation of healthful foods. Foods that are perfectly healthful and yet inexpensive, are to be made. To the poor the gospel of health is to be preached. In the manufacture of these \n51\nfoods ways will be opened up whereby those who accept the truth and lose their work will be able to earn a living. The productions which God has supplied are to be made up into healthful foods, which people can prepare for themselves. Then we can appropriately present the principles of health reform and those who hear will be convinced of the consistency of these principles, and will accept them. But until we can present health reform foods which are palatable, nourishing, and yet inexpensive, we are not at liberty to present the most advanced phases of health reform in diet. -Letter 98, 1901. Written June 19, 1901.",
