    "word": "Now I want that just as long as Willie's children are here, and they live here, [Ages: Henry and Herbert, 7 years; Grace, 3 years] I want they should have the discipline of a school.

Those mothers that want to keep their children at home, and are fully competent and would prefer to discipline them herself, why, no one has any objection to that. They can do that. But provision is to be made so that the children of all that have any connection with this food factory and sanitarium and these things that are being carried on here, should be educated. We must have it stand to reach the highest standards.",
