    "word": "The disciples of Christ are to bring the perfections of his character into their character. He has given us his word as spiritual food. As we eat this word, we shall grow up into him, manifesting unselfishness, integrity, kindness, and love. In all we do, Christlikeness is to be revealed. Thus we may show that we are eating the bread of heaven and drawing the living water from the wells of salvation.",
