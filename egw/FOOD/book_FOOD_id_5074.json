    "word": "I am instructed that the Lord will give wisdom to minds to prepare simple health foods. It will not be necessary to pay large sums of money for the privilege of manufacturing some foods that have a large sale. Let the people be taught how to cook properly, making simple preparations of healthful food. In the school the products of the soil, the fruits, the grains, and the vegetables, may be used to advantage.",
