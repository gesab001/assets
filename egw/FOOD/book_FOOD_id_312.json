    "word": "Unwise economy and artificial customs often prevent the exercise of hospitality where it is needed and would be a blessing. The regular supply of food for our tables should be such that the unexpected guest can be made welcome without burdening the housewife to make extra preparation.  MH 322203 {CCh 155.10} \nEconomy does not mean niggardliness, but a prudent expenditure of means because there is a great work to be done. {CCh 155.11} \nGod does not require that His people should deprive themselves of that which is really necessary for their health and comfort, but He does not approve of wantonness and extravagance and display.  AH 378, 379204 {CCh 155.12} \n\nDuty of Parents in Teaching the Children\nTeach your children that God has a claim upon all they possess, and that nothing can ever cancel this claim; all they have is theirs only in trust, to prove whether they will be obedient. Money is a needed treasure; let it not be lavished upon those who do not need it. Someone needs your willing gifts. If you have extravagant habits, cut them away from the life as soon as possible. Unless you do this, you will be bankrupt for eternity.  CG 134205",
