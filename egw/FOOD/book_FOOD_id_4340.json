    "word": "MR No. 568 - Materials Relating to the Establishment of the Avondale School\n\n     Last Wednesday we left Granville for Dora Creek. We were two hours and a half coming seventy-nine miles. We accomplished the journey very comfortably. Brother MacKensey, whom we met at the cars, came on with us. I am writing by the light of a candle set in a tin candlestick, and placed on a tall tin box in my folding chair. We did not think of taking lamps with us; but by this morning's experience in writing before daylight, they would have been of excellent service to us. We found a good dinner waiting for us, and all seemed to eat as if they relished the food. After dinner we went to the riverside, and Brethren Starr, MacKensey, and Collins seated themselves in one boat, Brethren Daniells, McCullagh, and Reekie in a still larger boat, and Willie White, Emily Campbell, and myself in another. We rode several miles upon the water. Though the stream is called Dora Creek, yet it has the appearance of a river, for it is a wide, deep stream. It is somewhat salty, but loses its saltiness as it borders the place which we are investigating. It required two rowers to pull the boat upstream. I should judge this is no creek, but a deep, narrow river, and the water is beautiful.",
