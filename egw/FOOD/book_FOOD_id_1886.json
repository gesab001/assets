The Lord does not call upon our people to establish institutions \n                                                                           170\nwhere all who come can receive food and lodging free, and where the peculiar points of our faith must not be introduced. The Lord has not laid this work upon any Seventh-day Adventist. To do this would be a misuse of time and means.",
