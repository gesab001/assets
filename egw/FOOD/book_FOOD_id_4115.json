    "word": "When our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world, appetite and passion exercised almost unlimited control. Men were debased, diseased, dwarfed, and crippled through the baneful effects of selfish indulgence in evil, and it seemed as if the world was about to be swept away under its disastrous power. But with all the sin and misery that were in the world then, and that we see about us now never can the power of appetite be fully understood until the significance of Christ's temptation and long fast in the wilderness is comprehended. \"When He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He was afterward an hungered.\" Matthew 4:2. And it was then, when Christ was fainting for food, that Satan came to Him, and sought to overpower Him with temptation.",
