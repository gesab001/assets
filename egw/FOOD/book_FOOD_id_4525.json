    "word": "It is your privilege to obtain most precious victories. Will you go forward in faith and hope and courage? You are privileged with the gift of the Word. It is full of instruction, and able to make you heirs of salvation. It is your duty to give the knowledge you have to others. You could not have a better opportunity than in perfecting a food business that will give the knowledge of health reform to others. To every man is given his work. You may be tested and tried in this way to see if you will let your light shine. Regard patience and kindness as sacred things which you must bring into every line of your work. You need to vindicate the greatness of the work by building up amiable characters. This you can do through the grace of Christ.",
