    "word": "The Lord has not given orders that the food business be exalted to large proportions. It will take something more than food stores and factories, with their perplexities and their commercial business, to make an impression that will convert souls. Unless the standard of godliness is raised, unless the principles of heaven are manifest in all business dealings, more souls will be lost by connecting with the food stores than will be saved by the work of these stores.",
