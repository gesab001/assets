    "word": "Eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God means studying God's word. But you have cast aside the word of God for a class of reading that has separated you from God, and result of this course of action has been seen in your words and actions, in your attitude toward those with whom you associate in the office. If you leave the cool snow waters of Lebanon for the turbid streams of the valley, your spiritual life will be of a malarious character. Put away all reading of a cheap character. It is exerting a baleful influence upon your soul. It is corroding your thoughts, filling your mind with hay, wood, and stubble. You cannot possibly do the work of God with clear-sighted perception while you give your mind this food. Your choice of reading is dwarfing and crippling your spiritual experience.--Letter 26, 1899, p. 5. (\"To the Men in Responsible Positions in the Work,\" typed February 10, 1899.)",
