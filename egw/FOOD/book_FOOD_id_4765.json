    "word": "Our institutions should not be located in the cities. The influences of the city are of a demoralizing character. Our institutions should be established in places where land can be secured and beautified. Especially is this true in regard to our schools. The students should be removed from the evil sights and sounds of the cities. If possible, properties on which there already are suitable buildings, or on which there are orchards in bearing should be purchased on which to establish schools. Then let vegetables and fruit be cultivated that the tables may be supplied with food which is fresh and free from decay. The culture of strawberries and other small fruits should be carried on.",
