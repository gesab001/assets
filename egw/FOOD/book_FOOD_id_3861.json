    "word": "Vague suppositions regarding Christ are not enough. We need an abiding Christ. We need to eat His Word. He is the Bread of Life. The revealed Word is our photograph of Christ. The world can only be expelled from the soul by filling the soul with Christ. Just as the life of the body is produced by the temporal food eaten, so the life of the soul is produced by the spiritual food eaten.",
