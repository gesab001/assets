    "word": "I have a suggestion to make to those who have moral courage and self-control enough to try it. If your work is sedentary, take exercise every day, and at each meal eat only two or three kinds of simple food, taking no more of these than will satisfy the demands of hunger. Make up your mind that this is all the food you will give your stomach. For some days perseveringly carry out your determination to eat less than you have in the past. See how this will work. Strong, hearty men, who are engaged in active physical labor, can eat food which those of sedentary habits can not eat without injury to their health. Those engaged in active physical labor are not compelled to be so careful as to the quantity or quality of their food. But even this class of people could have better health by practicing earnest self-control in eating and drinking. But \n\n\n                                   -43- \n\none's stomach cannot be made the rule for measuring the diet of every one else.",
