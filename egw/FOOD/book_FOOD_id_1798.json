    "word": "I cannot speak too highly of the steamer Cephalonia, which was our floating home for nearly eleven days. It is not one of the fastest, but it is said to be one of the most comfortable, steamers on the Atlantic. The captain and all the officials were kind and accommodating. The cooking was sensible, the food palatable. The bread, both white and graham, was excellent, and fruits, vegetables, and nuts were served liberally; while those who preferred meat found it prepared in almost every style.",
