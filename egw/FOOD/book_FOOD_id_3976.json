    "word": "I have a well-set table on all occasions. I make no change for visitors, whether believers or unbelievers. I never intend to be surprised by an unreadiness to have set at my table from one to half a dozen extra who may chance to come in. I have enough simple, healthful food ready to satisfy hunger and nourish the system. If any want more than this they are at liberty to find it elsewhere. No butter or flesh-meats of any kind come on my table. Cake is seldom found on my table. I generally have an ample supply of fruits, good bread and vegetables. Our table is always well patronized, and all who partake of the food do well, and improve upon it. All sit down with no epicurean appetite, and eat with a relish the bounties supplied by our Creator.",
