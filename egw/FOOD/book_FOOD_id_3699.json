    "word": "3 T.--569-570 \n     Our people are constantly retrograding upon health reform. Satan sees that he can not have such a controlling power over them as he could if appetite were indulged.

But because violated conscience is benumbed and becomes insensible, the guilt of the transgressor is not lessened.",
