    "word": "(1905) M.H. 307\n     223. We should not provide for the Sabbath a more liberal supply or a greater variety of food than for other days. Instead of this, the food should be more simple, and less should be eaten, in order that the mind may be clear and vigorous to comprehend spiritual things. A clogged stomach means a clogged brain. The most precious words may be heard and not appreciated, because the mind is confused by an improper diet. By overeating on the Sabbath, many do more than they think, to unfit themselves for receiving the benefit of its sacred opportunities. \n     [DROWSINESS IN SABBATH SERVICES--93] \n     [ABSTEMIOUS DIET IMPARTS MENTAL AND MORAL VIGOR--85, 117, \n          206] \n     [EFFECTS OF OVEREATING ON SPIRITUALITY--56, 57, 59, 251] \n     [EFFECTS OF OVEREATING ON THE MIND--74] \n     [OVEREATING AT CAMP MEETING--57, 124] \n     [SUICIDAL PRACTICES--202] \n     [DESSERTS A TEMPTATION TO OVEREATING--538, 547, 550] \n     [A SOURCE OF CHURCH TRIALS--65] \n     [GLUTTONY THE PREVAILING SIN OF THE AGE--35] \n     [OVEREATING LEADS TO DISSIPATION--244] \n     [KEEPING A CLEAN CONSCIENCE--263] \n     [INTEMPERANCE AND OVEREATING ENCOURAGED BY MOTHERS--351, \n          354]",
