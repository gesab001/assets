    "word": "One of the marked features of Noah's day was the intense worldliness that prevailed. Eating and drinking and dressing, buying and selling, marrying and giving in marriage, marked all classes, high and low. It is not sinful to supply the necessities of life. This is a duty. But when eating and drinking and dressing are made the supreme objects of life, then they become sin. God has provided food with which to supply hunger, but when eating and drinking are carried to excess they become gluttony and drunkenness, and this is sin.",
