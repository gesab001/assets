    "word": "MR No. 1245 - The Southern Work; Ellen White Disturbed by Dissension in Councils and Camp Meetings; Study the Word, and Seek Christ\n\n     (Written December 2, 1902, from \"Elmshaven,\" Sanitarium, California, to \"Dear Children Edson and Willie White.\") \n\n\n     I thank the Lord with heart and soul and voice that my health is as good as it is. I have every reason to praise my heavenly Father for the clearness of thought that He has given me in regard to Bible subjects. I long to bring out these precious things so that the minds of ministers and people may, if possible, be drawn away from contention and strife to something that is nourishing to the soul--food that will give health, hopefulness, and courage. Many are now saying, \"Report, and he will report it.\" Some are greedy for those things that satisfy a depraved spiritual appetite and that will ruin their religious experience, placing them outside the city of God with those who live and make a lie.",
