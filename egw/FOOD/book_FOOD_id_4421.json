    "word": "Dietary Intemperance Enfeebles the Brain--The success of acquiring a good memory and a calm, uniform temper depends not upon circumstances, but very much upon the way in which the stomach is treated. If food is taken at any and every time [it is desired], the organs of digestion are abused and man must pay the penalty. Nature will not suffer abuse without proclaiming it in disordered nerves and muscles and intellect. The gourmand--for this he may be called--who overloads his stomach should remember that the nerve power must be called upon to take care of the burden placed upon the stomach, and the brain is enfeebled in being deprived of the power necessary to strengthen the memory.--Ms 53, 1896, pp. 6,7. (April 24, 1896.)",
