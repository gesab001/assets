    "word": "There are in this world hearts that are crying aloud for the living God. But helpless human nature has been fed with distasteful food; discourses dissatisfying to hungry, starving souls have been given in the churches. In these discourses there is not that divine manifestation that touches the mind and creates a glow in the soul; the hearers cannot say, \"Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?\" An abundance of chaff is given to the people, but this will not awaken the transgressor or convict souls of sin. The souls who come to hear need a plain, straightforward presentation of truth. Those who have tasted of the word of God have dwelt long in an atmosphere where there is no God, and they long for the divine presence.",
