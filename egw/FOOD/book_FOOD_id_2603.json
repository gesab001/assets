We presented the case before the Lord, taking it as an evidence that if the child had appetite to eat we would venture. The first day there was no change for the better. He could not bear the least food The next day about noon he called for chicken broth, and it nourished him. We commenced our journey that night. About four o'clock I took my sick child upon a pillow, and we rode twenty miles. He seemed very nervous that night. He could not sleep, and I held him in my arms nearly the whole night. My husband \n                                                                           167\nwould frequently awake, and as he heard the sound of my rocking-chair, would groan, for he thought of the tedious journey before us. We obtained no sleep through the night.",
