    "word": "Make Condition of Unfortunate Brother Our Own.--When a man is struggling with honest endeavor to sustain himself and his family, and yet is unable to do this, so that they suffer for necessary food and clothing, the Lord will not pronounce our ministering brethren guiltless if they look on with indifference or prescribe conditions for this brother which are virtually impossible of fulfillment . . . We are to make the condition of the unfortunate brother our own.",
