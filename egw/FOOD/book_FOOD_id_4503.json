    "word": "In taking up business enterprises, you are in great danger of weaving strange threads into the pattern. I write this to caution you. It is because of this that I am afraid to have you take up the food business. My brother, be afraid to take the first step in business enterprises without earnest prayer. I have been instructed that your course in the past, in entering into worldly, money-making schemes, bears the rebuke of God. \n\n\n                                   -213- \n\nNothing of this kind is to be mingled with your present work. You have in the past made many mistakes, but the Lord has shown Himself gracious, pardoning all your transgressions.",
