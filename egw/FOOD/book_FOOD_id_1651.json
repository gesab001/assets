    "word": "How to Preserve Health. \n     106. Many have inquired of me, What course shall I take best to preserve my health? My answer is, Cease to transgress the laws of your being; cease to gratify a depraved appetite, eat simple food, dress healthfully, which will require modest simplicity, \n                                                                           31\nwork healthfully, and you will not be sick. . . . Many are suffering in consequence of the transgression of their parents. They cannot be censured for their parents' sins, but it is nevertheless their duty to ascertain wherein their parents violated the laws of their being; and wherein their parents' habits were wrong, they should change their own course, and place themselves, by correct habits, in a better relation to health.-- H.
