    "word": "Improper Food Combinations. \n     681. The less that condiments and desserts are placed upon our tables, the better it will be for all who partake of the food. All mixed and complicated foods are injurious to the health of human beings. Dumb animals would never eat such a mixture as is often placed in the human stomach. . . . Rich and complicated mixtures of food are health destroying.--U. T., Nov. 5, 1896.",
