    "word": "All this was an offense to God and must not have any place here at this meeting. There were souls starving for food and they must be fed. I told them that which the Spirit of God had revealed to me as I was conducted to the rooms of those who came to the conference. I was made to hear the conversation, the sarcasm, the evil feelings expressed, the bearing false witness, the making light of the message God sent, and the messenger who brought the message. I was told all this was wisdom that was from beneath in marked contrast to the wisdom that was from above, which has been specified by God through His apostles. [James 3:13-18 quoted.]",
