    "word": "Washington, D. C., Sunday, December 28, 1890 \n\n     In company with Elder Washburn, Sara McEnterfer and I left Washington at nine o'clock for Baltimore to meet a previous appointment at eleven o'clock. We learned the cars did not stop at the station where we had written for them to meet us, and no one was waiting for us at the next station. We met Sister Harris on the train and all four of us went on our way to find the place of meeting. It was not readily found. We walked from street to street. It was bitterly cold, but the air was bracing and good food for the lungs. After wandering about nearly one hour we were just as much in the dark as when we began the search. We searched directories in vain. We decided to take the streetcar and see where that would take us. This was wise. I believe the Lord suggested this to our minds. On the car was a colored sister just going to the meeting, and she directed us so we found the little hall, away out in the country. The hall was literally packed with believers and unbelievers. They had been waiting one hour, fearing that we would not come. How rejoiced were our brethren to see us!",
