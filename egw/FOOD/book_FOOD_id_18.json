    "word": "Appetite Alone Not a Safe Guide.--The idea that women, because of their special condition, may let the appetite run riot is a mistake based on custom, but not on sound sense. The appetite of women in this condition may be variable, fitful, and difficult to gratify; and custom allows her to have anything she may fancy, without consulting reason as to whether such food can supply nutrition for her body and for the growth of her child. The food should be nutritious, but should not be of an exciting quality. . . . If ever there is need of simplicity of diet and special care as to the quality of food eaten, it is in this important period.",
