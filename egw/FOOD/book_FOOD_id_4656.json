    "word": "We arrived in Maitland about four o'clock, giving us a little time to look at a hall with a view of renting it. It is a large building, having skylights for windows, and would be rented to us on condition that we would pay the taxes while we occupied it and give the first contributions to three benevolent enterprises. We decided to test the matter, and so we have accepted the offer. There are two rooms which can be used for holding cooking classes and in keeping health foods. This would save hiring another building.",
