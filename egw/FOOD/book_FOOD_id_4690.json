    "word": "Sister Semmens had worked very hard up to the time of her confinement and she is not as well as we could wish. She has a nice boy, one week old last Monday. I think she is much worried over a deformity in her child. He has a double harelip, and it is very hard for him to nurse. She is a very sensitive woman, and this keeps her back. I know this is one cause of her weakness. The want of means has made it very hard for them both, but this could not be helped. I have done what I could. I advanced thirty-five pounds, and the health foods have been highly appreciated.",
