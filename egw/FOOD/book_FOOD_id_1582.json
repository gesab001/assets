    "word": "I have been given a presentation of how the food work, if conducted as a commercial enterprise, will spread and become a dangerous element in our work. I am bidden to say to men and women, Keep your conscience clear before God. Do not place yourselves where you will be tempted and tried by the sight of your eyes and the hearing of your ears, so that you will lose your spiritual perception of what it means to be a Christian. Hold the standard firmly, and raise it high. Let no one talk you into engaging in work that will hinder you from making the preparation that you must make in order to meet Christ in peace.",
