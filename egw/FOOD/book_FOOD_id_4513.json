    "word": "A healthy experience demands growth, and growth demands that careful attention be paid to the laws of nature, that the organs of the body may be kept in a sound state, untrammeled in their action. There is great need that temperance in all things be taught and practiced. Tobacco and liquors of all kinds becloud man's reason and place him below the brute creation. These things must be strictly avoided. And only food of the most wholesome character should be used; for we are built up from the food we eat. That which we place in the stomach becomes flesh and blood, and we can make our blood impure by eating meat and other injurious articles.",
