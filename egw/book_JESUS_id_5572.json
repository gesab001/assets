{"word": "We can never be saved in inactivity. The life of Jesus rebukes every idler. In his strength we may do much greater and more perfect work. The promises of God are rich, and full, and free, and we may have the power of his salvation with us. Then why do we not believe him and work for him? It is because threads of unbelief are woven into all the woof of life; but shall we not now begin to weave in the precious golden threads of faith? Remember, \\93This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\\94 [1 John 5:4.] If clouds hide the sun from sight, we do not mourn as though it would never appear again. God's dear face of brightness is not always seen; but we are not to despond. It is our duty to trust him in the darkness, knowing that his love is changeless. Then let us put all our powers into our work; let us devote our voice and pen to the service of God, not laboring in our own strength or to please ourselves; and we shall see sinners converted, and God will give us a rich reward.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 456}
