    "word": "Chap. 6 - Experience Not Reliable\n\n     Dear Sister N: In the view given me December 10, 1871, I saw that some things had been great hindrances to your recovery of health. Your peculiar traits of character have prevented you from receiving the good you might have received, and from improving in health as you might have improved. \n                                                                           68\nYou have a special routine to go through and you will not be turned aside from it. You have your ideas, which you carry out, when frequently they are not in harmony with physical law, but simply with your judgment.",
