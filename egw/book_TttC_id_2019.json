    "word": "It is inappropriate for Christians in any age of the world \n                                                                           145\nto be lovers of pleasure, but how much more so now when the scenes of this earth's history are so soon to close. Surely the foundation of your hope of everlasting life cannot be laid too sure. The welfare of your soul and your eternal happiness depend upon whether your foundation is built upon Christ. While others are panting after earthly enjoyments, be ye panting after the unmistakable assurance of the love of God, earnestly, fervently crying: Who will show me how to make my calling and election sure? One of the signs of the last days is, that professed Christians are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Deal truly with your own soul. Search carefully. How few, after a faithful examination, can look up to heaven and say: \"I am not one of those thus described! I am not a lover of pleasure more than a lover of God!\" How few can say: \"I am dead to the world; the life I now live is by faith in the Son of God! My life is hid with Christ in God, and when He who is my life shall appear, then shall I also appear with Him in glory.\" The love and grace of God! Oh, precious grace! more valuable than fine gold. It elevates and ennobles the spirit beyond all other principles, and sets the affections upon heaven. While those around us may be vain and engaged in pleasure-seeking and folly, our conversation is in heaven, whence we look for the Saviour; the soul is reaching out after God for pardon and peace, for righteousness and true holiness. Converse with God and contemplation of things above transform the soul into the likeness of Christ. \n\n                                               -",
