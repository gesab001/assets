{"word": "Keep fast hold on Jesus. Look up to the haven of rest and the home of the blest. Keep your soul in the love of God whatever may betide, and you will grow spiritually strong. Jesus is your loving Friend; He will take your hand and help you over every hard and trying place. A grateful, trustful, habitual recognition of God lies at the very foundation of all right conduct, all true character. You must never lose confidence in God. It were less sinful, less unreasonable, to forget every human friend you have in the world than to forget God. I know that you love God, and I know you will try to serve Him in all sincerity, in all fidelity, and no one will ever be able to make you afraid or ashamed to be known as a servant of the Most High God. May the Lord bless you is the prayer of (signed) Ellen G. White.--Letter 22, Sept. 19, 1886, to Dr. J. S. Gibbs, a physician at the Rural Health Retreat, St. Helena, California.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 276}
