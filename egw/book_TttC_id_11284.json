    "word": "God says to His people: \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" Isaiah 60:1. Why, then, do they feel so little burden to plant the standard of truth in new places? Why do they not obey the word: \"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not\"? Luke 12:33. Why do they not return to the Lord His own, to be invested in heavenly merchandise? Why is there not a more earnest call for volunteers to enter the whitening harvest field? Unless more is done than has been done for the cities of America, ministers and people will have a heavy account to settle with the One who has appointed to every man his work.",
