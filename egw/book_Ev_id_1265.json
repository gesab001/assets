{"word": "How Paul Corrected Wrongs.--Contentions in the body of believers are not after the order of God. They result from the manifestation of the attributes of the natural heart. To all who bring in disorder and disunion, the words of Paul are applicable: \"I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.\" Paul here addressed a people whose advancement was not proportionate to their privileges and opportunities. They ought to have been able to bear the hearing of the plain Word of God, but they were in the position in which the disciples were when Christ said to them, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" They ought to have been far advanced in spiritual knowledge, able to comprehend and practice the higher truths of the Word; but they were unsanctified. They had forgotten that they must be purged from their hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong, and that they must not cherish carnal attributes. \n                                                                           370", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 369}
