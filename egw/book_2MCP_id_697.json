{"word": "Never Utter a Word of Doubt.--All have trials--griefs hard to bear, temptations hard to resist. Do not tell your troubles to your fellow mortals but carry everything to God in prayer. Make it a rule never to utter one word of doubt or discouragement. You can do much to brighten the life of others and strengthen their efforts, by words of hope and holy cheer.--SC 119, 120 (1892).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 575}
