{"word": "Freedom From Human Suppositions.--The work of God is a great work. Wise men are needed, to keep Bible principles free from a particle of worldly policy. Every worker is being tested.

If these souls are saved, it will be as by fire, \n                                                                           214\nbecause they conscientiously thought they were working in harmony with the Word. They will only be as brands snatched out of the burning.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 213}
