    "word": "The Sacrifice on Mount Carmel \n\n     Elijah demands a convocation at Carmel of all Israel and also of all the prophets of Baal. The awful solemnity in the looks of the prophet gives him the appearance of one standing in the presence of the Lord God of Israel. The condition of Israel in their apostasy demands a firm demeanor, stern speech, and commanding authority. God prepares the message to fit the time and occasion. Sometimes He puts His Spirit upon His messengers to sound an alarm day and night, as did His messenger John: \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord.\" Then, again, men of action are needed who will not be swerved from duty, but whose energy will arouse and demand, \"Who is on the Lord's side?\" let him come over with us. God will have a fitting message to meet His people in their varied conditions.",
