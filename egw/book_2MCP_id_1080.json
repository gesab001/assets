{"word": "Save All the Strength of the Will.--The work of \"breaking the will\" is contrary to the principles of Christ. The will of the child must be directed and guided. Save all the strength of the will, for the human being needs it all; but give it proper direction. Treat it wisely and tenderly, as a sacred treasure. Do not hammer it in pieces; but by precept and true example fashion and mold it until the child comes to years of responsibility.--CT 116 (1913).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 688}
