    "word": "God is the source of all wisdom. He is infinitely wise, and just, and good. The wisest men that ever lived cannot comprehend him. They may profess to be wise; they may glory in their great attainments; but mere intellectual knowledge, aside from the great truths that center in Christ, is as nothingness. \"Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom;... but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth.\"",
