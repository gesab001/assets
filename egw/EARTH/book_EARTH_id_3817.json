    "word": "GARMENTS OF WHITEST WHITE.\u2014Christ emptied Himself, and took the form of a servant, and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. As the high priest, after performing his service in the holy of holies, came forth to the waiting congregation in his pontifical robes, so Christ will come the second time clothed in glorious garments of the whitest white, \u201csuch as no fuller on earth can whiten them.\u201d He will come in His own glory, and in the glory of His Father, as King of kings and Lord of lords, and all the angelic host will escort Him on His way.\u2014Ms 113, 1899 quoted in 1BC 1111, 1112.",
