    "word": "Chap. 21 - Prepare to Meet the Lord\n\n     I saw that we should not put off the coming of the Lord. Said the angel: \"Prepare, prepare, for what is coming upon the earth. Let your works correspond with your faith.\" I saw that the mind must be stayed upon God, and that our influence should tell for God and His truth. We cannot honor the Lord when we are careless and indifferent. We cannot glorify Him when we are desponding. We must be in earnest to secure our own soul's salvation, and to save others. All importance should be attached to this, and everything besides should come in secondary.",
