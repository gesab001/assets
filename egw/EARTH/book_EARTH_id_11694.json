    "word": "God will work with the church, but not without their cooperation. May every one of you who have tasted the good Word of God \"let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 5:16). Jesus says, \"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.\" The saving salt, the savor of the Christian, is the love of Jesus in the heart, the righteousness of Christ pervading the soul. If the professor of religion would keep the saving efficacy of his faith, he must ever keep the righteousness of Christ before him, and have the glory of God for his rearward. Then the power of Christ will be revealed in life and character.",
