    "word": "That which is most prized by the world's Redeemer, most sought for in His representatives, is purity and charity that suffereth long and is kind. \"Every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.\" This is sanctified knowledge. If we love one another as Christ has loved us, His love is perfected in us. \"He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\" The coldness and lack of sympathy that has come into our ranks is not of God. It is of the wicked one. How few really believe that the law of God is comprehended and fulfilled by him who loves God supremely and his neighbor as himself. This is indeed honoring God in the highest, and bringing peace on earth, good will toward men.",
