    "word": "The Lord laid upon me a burden in regard to the publishing house at Battle Creek. In the council room at the tabernacle I read a message to a large number assembled. The same matter was afterwards repeated to the managers of the publishing house. All was done that I could do. I had the matter copied, and placed in the hands of responsible persons, to see that the will of the Lord was carried out. But time passed, the necessary changes were not made. The message laid out in clear lines, the principles that should ever govern the office of publication. It was stated that if selfishness should be developed, if the men in office should accept large wages, the blessing of the Lord could not attend the institution until these things should be corrected. The spirit of the councils was not approved of God. There were unholy confederacies, one worker upholding and sustaining another. God was displeased. \"Let the potsherd \n                                                                           1231\nstrive with the potsherds of the earth, but woe unto him that striveth with his Maker.",
