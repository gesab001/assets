    "word": "To make missionaries. \n\n\n     \"God wants every child of tender age to be his child, to be adopted into his family. Young though they may be, the youth may be members of the household of faith, and have the most precious experience. They may have hearts that are tender and ready to receive lasting impressions. Their hearts may be drawn out in confidence and love for Jesus, that they may live for the Saviour. Christ will make them little missionaries. The whole current of their thoughts may be changed, so that sin will not appear a thing to be enjoyed, but to be hated and shunned. Children who are properly instructed will be witnesses for the truth. . . We may bring hundreds and thousands of children to Christ if we will work for them. Let all who read these words be melted and subdued. Let us in our educational work embrace far more of the children and youth than we have done, and there will be a whole army of missionaries raised up to work for God. In the last days children's voices will be heard proclaiming the message. As Christ in the temple solved the mysteries which priests and rulers had not discerned, so in the closing \n                                                                           41\nwork of this earth children in their simplicity will speak words which will be an astonishment to men who now talk of 'higher education.' Then let the church carry a burden for the lambs of the flock in its locality, and see how many can be educated and trained to do service for God.\"--P.C., \"Need of Church Schools.\"",
