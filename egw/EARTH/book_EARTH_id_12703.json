    "word": "\"Take My yoke upon you,\" Christ said, as in human nature He lived and worked upon this earth. Constantly He wore the yoke of submission, meeting the difficulties that human beings must meet, bearing the trials that they must bear. The enemy will continually assail us as he assailed Christ, bringing against us strong temptation. But for every one there is a way of escape. \"Take My yoke upon you,\" Christ says, \"and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" Matthew 11:29, 30.",
