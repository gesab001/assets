    "word": "While we review, not the dark chapters in our experience, to complain, but the manifestations of His great mercy and unfailing love and power revealed in our deliverance, we will praise far more than complain. We will talk of the loving faithfulness of God, as the true, tender, compassionate Shepherd of His flock, which He has declared none shall pluck out of His hand. The language of the heart will not be selfish murmuring and repining, but praise, like clear flowing streams, will come from God's truly believing ones. \"Goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\" \"Thou shall guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.\" \"Whom have I in \n\n\n                                     -216- \n\nheaven but Thee, and there is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee.\"",
