    "word": "Will You Help \n\n     What is the great work before us?--The proclamation of the gospel, with its life-saving principles, to every nation and kindred and tongue and people. Let no one remain in idleness because he can not do the same class of work that the most experienced of God's servants are doing. Because you can not be in the highest place, will you do nothing? Because you can not trade upon pounds, will you refuse to trade upon the one pound? Because you have not five talents, will you put your one talent in a napkin and hide it in the earth? Because you can not work for the multitude, will you refuse to work for individuals? Do the smaller duties waiting for you. Thus you will help those who are bearing heavy responsibilities.",
