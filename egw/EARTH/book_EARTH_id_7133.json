    "word": "Conjectures Regarding the Future Life \n\n     There are men today who express their belief that there will be marriages and births in the new earth; but those who believe the Scriptures cannot accept such doctrines. The doctrine that children will be born in the new earth is not a part of the \"sure word of prophecy\" (2 Peter 1:19). The words of Christ are too plain to be misunderstood. \n                                                                           173\nThey should forever settle the question of marriages and births in the new earth. Neither those who shall be raised from the dead, nor those who shall be translated without seeing death, will marry or be given in marriage. They will be as the angels of God, members of the royal family.",
