ROBINSON AT THE ELMSHAVEN OFFICE DREW TOGETHER FROM PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED E. G. WHITE SOURCES MATERIALS RELATING TO THE CHURCH, ITS ORGANIZATION, AUTHORITY, UNITY, AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF WORKERS ONE TO ANOTHER.\n     THE 50 PAGE DOCUMENT WHICH RESULTED WAS READ BY THE WHITE TRUSTEES WITH APPRECIATION, BUT FOR REASONS NOT TOO CLEAR JUST NOW, THE DOCUMENT AT THAT TIME WAS NOT CARRIED THROUGH TO PUBLICATION. IT WAS PLACED IN THE DOCUMENT FILE AND HAS BEEN KEPT THERE SAFELY FOR 38 YEARS, WITH ONLY OCCASIONAL REFERENCE TO IT.\n     WITH THE OCCASION TO LOOK AT THE COUNSELS RELATING TO THE CHURCH AND ITS AUTHORITY, THIS DOCUMENT, DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS, HAS BEEN REVIEWED. THE IMPRESSION IS GROWING THAT ITS PUBLICATION MIGHT WELL SERVE THE CHURCH. THE BASIC PREMISES ARE CLEARLY ENUNCIATED IN PUBLISHED SOURCES. NONETHELESS, AS ELLEN WHITE AGAIN AND AGAIN REITERATED IN SERMONS, MANUSCRIPTS AND LETTERS BASIC TRUTHS CONCERNING THE CHURCH AND ITS MINISTRY, THE VARYING STATEMENTS SEEM TO ENRICH THAT WHICH MAY BE READ ON THE SUBJECT.\n     FOR STUDY PURPOSES, IN A FEW COPIES THE LINES HAVE BEEN NUMBERED. ANY USE OF UNPUBLISHED ITEMS MUST FOR THE PRESENT BE RESTRICTED TO COMMITTEE STUDY. UNDOUBTEDLY, ON CONSIDERATION THEY WILL IN TIME BE RELEASED FOR GENERAL USE. THE SITUATION, HOWEVER, WOULD LEAD TO THE REQUEST THAT COPIES USED BY THE COMMITTEE BE RETURNED TO THE WHITE ESTATE UNTIL THE MATTERS HAVE BEEN PROPERLY PROCESSED.\n\n                                          ARTHUR L.

He has a chosen people, a church on the earth, whom He has made the depositaries of His law. He has committed to them sacred trust and eternal truth to be given to the world. He would reprove and correct them. The message to the Laodiceans is applicable to Seventh-day Adventists who have had great light and have not walked in the light. It is those who have made great profession, but have not kept in step with their Leader, that will be spewed out of His mouth unless they repent. The message to pronounce the Seventh-day Adventist Church Babylon, and call the people of God out of her, does not come from any heavenly messenger, or any human agent inspired by the Spirit of God.",
