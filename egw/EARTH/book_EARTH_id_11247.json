    "word": "Angels Strengthen Our Faith\n     \u201cThe angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.\u201d Psalm 34:7. God commissions His angels to save His chosen ones from calamity, to guard them from \u201cthe pestilence that walketh in darkness\u201d and \u201cthe destruction that wasteth at noonday.\u201d Psalm 91:6. Again and again have angels talked with men as a man speaketh with a friend, and led them to places of security. Again and again have the encouraging words of angels renewed the drooping spirits of the faithful and, carrying their minds above the things of earth, caused them to behold by faith the white robes, the crowns, the palm branches of victory, which overcomers will receive when they surround the great white throne.\u2014AA 153.",
