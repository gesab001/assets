    "word": "I have not dared to speak to you smooth things. I have not dared to prophesy deceit. I have declared to you the word of the Lord, but some things I have not communicated in so plain and sharp a manner as the case demanded. You have not accepted the testimonies of warning and reproof which the Lord has given. You have had a hatred of the message which his chosen messengers have proclaimed. \n                                                                           1301\nYou have acted and expressed the hatred of your hearts just as far as you have dared to do so. If Jesus had been upon the earth, he would have cleansed his temple courts from the buyers and the sellers; he would have driven out the men who were dealing unjustly, and would have said, \"Take these things hence;\" for \"it is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\"",
