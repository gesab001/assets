    "word": "Many professed Christians are well represented by the vine that is trailing upon the ground and entwining its tendrils about the roots and rubbish that lie in its path. To all such the message comes, \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord.\" 2 Corinthians 6:17. ... Your tendrils must be severed from everything earthly. . . . It is impossible for you to unite with those who are corrupt, and still remain pure.",
