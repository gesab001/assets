    "word": "The Holy Scriptures are to be just as precious to the colored man as to the white man. In the South the white believers and the colored believers, because of the prejudice existing, may meet together in different houses of worship. But every church, whether composed of white or of colored members, is to reveal to the world a representation of Christ\u2019s sufficiency. Every church is under the most sacred obligation to show that they are seeking a preparation for the future life in the earth made new, where there will be no lines of distinction. God will put up no walls of partition\n127\nbetween the white and the colored believers. Men have put up their barriers in this world, but there are no such barriers in the home that Christ is preparing for those who love Him.",
