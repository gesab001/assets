    "word": "\"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" By His life of sacrifice, Christ has made it possible for man to become a partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. The salvation of souls was the great object for which Christ sacrificed His royal robe and kingly crown, the glory of heaven and the homage of the angels, and, laying aside His divinity, came to earth to labor and suffer with humanity upon Him. As workers together with Him, we are to expect special blessings and definite results as we strive to save souls from the snares of Satan that they may become children of light.",
