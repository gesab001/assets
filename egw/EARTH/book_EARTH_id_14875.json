    "word": "I have repeatedly been instructed that no one should be advised to pledge himself to spend two, three, four, five, or six years under any one man's supervision. Let students stand where they can follow the will of God. Their service belongs to Him. (88) Their capabilities and talents are to be refined, purified, ennobled. In this lower school--the school of earth--they are to be prepared for translation into the school of heaven, where their education will be continued under the personal supervision of Christ, the great Teacher, who will lead them beside the living waters, and open to them the mysteries of the kingdom of God.",
