    "word": "Poems and stories have been recommended in the columns of our papers in a way that seemed quite out of harmony with their value. The small story books that are being handled by our people, what are they? Many of them \n\n\n                                    -275- \n\ncontain nothing of more value than can be obtained in any book store. We have books of great value, which should be recommended to the people; but it pains me to see our papers recommending and our people handling so many story books. These books may be excellent in some ways, but they do not contain the knowledge that we should hunger and thirst to obtain in this period of the earth's history.--Letter 75, 1900, p. 2. (To Elder G. A. Irwin, May 21, 1900.)",
