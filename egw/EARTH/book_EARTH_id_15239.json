In it there are some things that I think would be better left out. Let us not dwell on the dark chapters in the experiences of Seventh-day Adventists. They bring up a discouraging, depressing picture, and it would seem as if Christ, the Light of the world, had not been near to help. There was no need of the dearth of knowledge, as he ever will be, the way, the truth, and the life. He was ready to help, and no one need have made grave mistakes or errors.",
