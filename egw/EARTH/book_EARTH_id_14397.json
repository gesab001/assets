    "word": "After the Saviour was placed in the sepulcher of Joseph, a great stone was rolled before it and sealed. While Roman soldiers who had been commanded to guard the tomb stood at their post of duty, lo, a mighty angel, commissioned to roll back the stone from the sepulcher, came in bright, heavenly glory, parting the darkness from his track. The astonished guard saw him roll back the stone as easily as if it had been a pebble. The glorious light caused them to fall as dead men to the earth, but they were sensible enough of what was occurring to see that Christ rose from the tomb.",
