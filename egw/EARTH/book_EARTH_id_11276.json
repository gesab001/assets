    "word": "Calling upon the prophet to leave the cave in which\n133\nhe had hidden, the angel bade him stand before the Lord on the mount, and listen to His word. As Elijah obeyed, \u201cbehold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.\u201d His petulance was silenced, his spirit softened and subdued. He now knew that a quiet trust, a firm reliance on God, would ever find for him a present help in time of need.\u2014RH Oct. 23, 1913.",
