    "word": "Can any earthly promotion confer honor equal to this--to be sons of God, children of the heavenly King, members of the royal family? . . . The nobility of earth are but men; they die, and return to dust; and there is no lasting satisfaction in their praise and honor. But the honor that comes from God is lasting. To be heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, is to be entitled to unsearchable riches--treasures of such value that in comparison with them the gold and silver, the gems and precious stones of earth, sink into insignificance.",
