    "word": "Jesus did not yield up his life till he had accomplished the work which he came to do, and exclaimed with his departing breath, \"It is finished.\" Satan then was defeated. He knew that his kingdom was lost. Angels rejoiced as the words were uttered, \"It is finished.\" The great plan of redemption, which was dependent on the death of Christ, had been thus far carried out. And there was joy in Heaven that the sons of Adam could, through a life of obedience, be finally exalted to the throne of God. Oh, what love! What amazing love! that brought the Son of God to earth to be made sin for us, that we might be reconciled to God, and elevated to a life with him in his mansions in glory. Oh! What is man, that such a price should be paid for his redemption!",
