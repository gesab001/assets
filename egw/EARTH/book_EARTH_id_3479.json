    "word": "Christ descends upon the Mount of Olives, whence, after his resurrection, he ascended, and where angels repeated the promise of his return. Says the prophet, \u201cThe Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.\u201d \u201cAnd his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives \n663\nshall cleave in the midst thereof, . . . and there shall be a very great valley.\u201d \u201cAnd the Lord shall be King over all the earth. In that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.\u201d [Zechariah 14:5, 4, 9.] As the New Jerusalem, in its dazzling splendor, comes down out of Heaven, it rests upon the place purified and made ready to receive it, and Christ with his people and the angels, enters the holy city.",
