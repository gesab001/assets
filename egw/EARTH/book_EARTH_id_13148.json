    "word": "Angels of God have stood by the side of those who worked so nobly at Avondale. I thank the Lord that at the time when there was so great a dearth of means, we did not sit down and fold our hands, making no effort to advance. I thank the Lord that He put it into the hearts of our friends in Africa to help in time of need. And I shall never forget the faithful labors of Elder Haskell and yourself in collecting the means that enabled us to place the work where we could leave Australia to come to America, at a time when my testimony was needed here. The Lord has been very good. As I think of the poverty, the scarcity of bread and clothing, and of the missionary work we tried to do, I look upon the whole matter as a wonderful thing. The work is an object lesson for all who enter new fields. Let all say, \"See what the Lord hath wrought!\" . . .",
