    "word": "History and prophecy testify that the God of the whole earth revealeth secrets through His chosen light-bearers to the world. A skeptical world, talking and writing of higher education, is prating of things which they do not understand. They do not see that true higher education comprehends a more perfect knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, whom He has sent. There are few who understand that all true human science is from the God of science, and that God demonstrates to the world that He is king over all.",
