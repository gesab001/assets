    "word": "We have in the glorious things of nature a mere shadow of the original, which we shall see in their full loveliness in the Paradise of God. Let us learn the precious lessons which God designed we should. He who careth for the simple flowers in their season, will He not much more care for you whom He has created in His own image? Look upon these things of beauty. God prepared and clothed them with a robe of loveliness, and yet they perish in a day. All these earthly, temporal beauties are to be appreciated as the voice of God speaking to us of the treasures and glories of the unseen and the eternal.",
