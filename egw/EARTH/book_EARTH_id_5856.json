    "word": "Our little world is the lesson book of the universe. God\u2019s wonderful purpose of grace, the mystery of redeeming love, is the theme into which \u201cangels desire to look\u201d, and it will be their study throughout endless ages. Both the redeemed and the unfallen beings will find in the cross of Christ their science and their song. It will be seen that the glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sacrificing love. In the light from Calvary it will be seen that the law of self-renouncing love is the law of life for earth and heaven; that the love which \u201cseeketh not her own\u201d has its source in the heart of God. . . .",
