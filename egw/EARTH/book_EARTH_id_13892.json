    "word": "A cruel spirit of selfishness is entertained and cherished by the members of the family of God on earth, and too often they act like quarrelsome children. Christ cannot cooperate with them. He invites His people to come to Him, and to gain from His strength that will enable them to grow up \"unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\" Those who refuse to grow up into men and women in Christ will ever be quarrelsome, overbearing, criticizing, denunciatory.",
