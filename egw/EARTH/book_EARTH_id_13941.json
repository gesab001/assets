    "word": "Will those who claim to believe the truth practice the principles of the truth which sanctifies the soul? In this, the closing period of the earth's history, let not men be careless in words or acts, let them not indulge a masterful spirit, and provoke the wrath of their enemies. Let not any soul who claims to believe the truth give others occasion to conclude that he is not a Christian, because he talks and acts like a sinner.",
