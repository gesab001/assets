    "word": "MR No. 709 - Appeal for Total Consecration\n\n     Brother and Sister_____, you have linked your lives together. God calls upon you to unite yourselves more closely with Jesus. I bear this solemn message to you both that you are in danger of losing your souls. Only the truly penitent, those whose sins are confessed and pardoned, will find a place in the city of God and an inheritance in the earth made new. But there is hope for you both; you may have a transformation of character if you will. You may have it now; it is not too late to make your calling and election sure. There is a fountain open for Judah in Jerusalem. Here you may wash and be clean. Jesus will cleanse you from every sin, if you sincerely repent. Oh, if you would only see and feel the necessity of keeping step with the leader, Jesus Christ. Lift the cross, deny self, humble your hearts before God, and you can now recover yourselves out of the snare of Satan.",
