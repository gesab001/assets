    "word": "Thursday morning we were driven over a portion of Mountain View, and shown the ruins of several buildings, including the post office and some two-story brick buildings, that were completely wrecked by the earthquake. I was made sad to see the ruins of the sides of the \"Signs\" Office. The building has been repaired temporarily, and the chapel was repaired sufficiently to make it safe and comfortable for Sabbath services. We have reason to thank the Lord that no greater damage was done. Thursday afternoon I met with the brethren in council, and spoke a short time. \n\n\n                          -175-",
