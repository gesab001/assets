    "word": "The preachers are not all given up to the work of God, as he requires them to be. Some have felt that the lot of a preacher was hard, because they had to be separated from their families. They forget that once it was harder laboring than it is now. Once there were but few friends of the cause. They forget those upon whom God laid the burden of the work in the past. There were but few, then, who received the truth as the result of much labor. God's chosen servants wept and prayed for the clear understanding of truth. They suffered privation and much self-denial, in order to spread the truth. Step by step they followed as God's opening providence led the way. They did not study their convenience, or shrink at \n                                                                           117\nhardships. God, through these men, prepared the way, and the truth has been made plain to the understanding of every honest mind. Every thing has been made ready to the hands of ministers who have since embraced the truth, and some of these have failed to take upon them the burden of the work. They seek for an easier lot, a less self-denying position. This earth is not the resting-place of Christians, much less for the chosen ministers of God. They forget that Christ left his riches and glory in Heaven, and came to die, and has commanded us to love one another even as he has loved us. They forget those who wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, and were afflicted and tormented, of whom the world was not worthy.",
