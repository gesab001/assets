    "word": "Jesus gave His life that these precious souls might have eternal life. \"We are laborers together with God.\" What sacrifice will you make? What self-denial will you practice? It may be self-denial for a time, but in the end it is the greatest blessing to soul, body, and spirit that you can experience. We have a duty to humanity. We are bound before God, if we possess eternal life, to show that we appreciate the value of the sacrifice which Christ has made, and that is to purchase heaven, that we may glorify His name upon the earth, and that we may win souls to the cross of Calvary, that we may win souls to teach them how to give their hearts to Jesus \n\n\n                                    -266- \n\nChrist, that we may represent Jesus Christ as Jesus Christ represented the love of the Father. This is our business in the world.",
