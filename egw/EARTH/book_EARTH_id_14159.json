    "word": "The time of trouble has already begun. We hear continually of riots and accidents, of murders and robberies. Human life is no longer safe unless under the protection of God. God's servants must not be surprised that they meet with great difficulties and persecution at this time.

He had to go from city to city to ensure His safety, and this persecution followed Him until His work on earth was accomplished.",
