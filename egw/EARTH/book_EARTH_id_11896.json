    "word": "Let us make straight paths for our feet. The Lord will not leave those who love Him and keep His commandments to be spoiled by the enemy. A short work will the Lord do upon the earth, and He will stir His people mightily. A great work is to be done. Let us read and study the fifty-fifth and sixty-sixth [fifty-sixth] chapters of Isaiah; for they contain wonderful encouragement, and the Lord wants us to bring all the uplifting possible to His people.",
