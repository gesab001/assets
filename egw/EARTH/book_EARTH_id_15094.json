Let us do all in our power to enlighten the people in this large field. It is the privilege of every believer to let the light shine forth. We are drawing near to the close of this earth's history; we have not one hour to devote to needless matters.

And hope and faith will strengthen as the workers for God put their trust in Him. \n\n                                               -",
