    "word": "All have not that faith which works by love and purifies the soul from all earthly dross. The purification through the Spirit must take place in their own minds and hearts. Unless this divine principle is brought into the life and practice, there can be no such fruit borne as unfeigned, fervent love for one another. There are in the human heart hereditary and cultivated partialities so that this love will not be practiced unless the divine grace shall purify the natural tendencies of the human heart. Lust for forbidden things will obtain the mastery, and self will be glorified. . . .",
