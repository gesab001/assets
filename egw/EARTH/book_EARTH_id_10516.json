    "word": "\"For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto Himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: but because the Lord loved you, and because He would keep the oath which He had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand. . . . Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.\" Please read carefully the whole of the seventh chapter of Deuteronomy, and think upon the word of the Lord.",
