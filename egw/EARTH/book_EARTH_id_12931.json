    "word": "Behold Satan's miracle-working power. Every object in the earth, in the air, and in the water has been employed to confirm his claim. Those who yield to these claims are alive with intense activity, one influencing and stimulating another by confirming the greatness and glory of their kingdom. See the activity, the restless surging of the mass in their determination to take and occupy the place of the throne of God. What eagerness, what rage they exhibit in their religious enthusiasm. Mark the defiant rebellion written in their countenances. Their warfare is against their Creator and Redeemer. How vast is the procession they form. How mighty they think themselves to be in their countless numbers.",
