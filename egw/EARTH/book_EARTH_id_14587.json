    "word": "It was this same spirit in the Jews which called forth the words of Christ, \"Ye are both ignorant of the Scriptures and of the power of God.\" They entertained the idea that Christ at his first advent was to break the Roman yoke from off their necks, and that he would then honor Israel by placing them above every other people on the earth. And they produced Scripture to sustain them; but they were deceived; the Old Testament prophecies which relate to the glorious second appearing of Christ, they applied to his first advent, and many, even the wise and educated, were deceived. Their error was fatal. \n                                                                           700",
