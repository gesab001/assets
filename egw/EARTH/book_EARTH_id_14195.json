    "word": "The ministers of God must be ministers of righteousness, who always wear the yoke of Christ and always follow the path of justice and integrity. No words caused by religious dyspepsia should be spoken. God has a people on this earth, and those who minister in word and doctrine must be one, as Christ is one with the Father. The Lord desires all to draw together in even cords as they engage in the solemn services of His sanctuary. As God meets with His people, let not those who are leading the service seek to draw the people to themselves. Let them say instead, \"God is among us. We are in the presence of Him whom we have come to worship. It is His will that all who worship Him shall respect and love one another, carrying out the instruction given by Christ just before His crucifixion.\" John 17:19-26.",
