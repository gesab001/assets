    "word": "The world could not bear Him. Just three years and a half of public ministry and then they got rid of Him. The heavenly vine was taken and transplanted on the other side of the wall. There the heavenly boughs hang over this side of the wall by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was given to man and here the communication is to be kept up between heaven and earth, \n\n\n                                    -244- \n\nbetween God and man. The communication is to be preserved lest man be overcome of the world. Christ says, \" I have overcome the world.\" Why? On our behalf. That you may overcome as He overcame. Then our work is to seek God with all our hearts that we may find Him.",
