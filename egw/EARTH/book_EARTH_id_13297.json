    "word": "This world is our field of missionary toil, but how few among Seventh-day Adventists have realized this! The condition of our large cities is represented by the condition of the world before the flood, when \"God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually\" (Genesis 6:5).

Many who have never heard the truth shall feel the conviction of the Spirit as they listen to the message of startling importance. \n\n\n                                    -15-",
