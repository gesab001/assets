    "word": "Cumbered with humanity, Christ could not be in every place personally; therefore it was altogether for their advantage that He should leave them, go to His father, and send the Holy Spirit to be His successor on earth. The Holy Spirit is Himself divested of the personality of humanity and independent thereof. He would represent Himself as present in all places by His Holy Spirit, as the Omnipresent. \"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall (although unseen by you), [THIS PHRASE WAS ADDED BY ELLEN WHITE.] teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you\" [John 14:26]. \"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the \n\n\n                               -24- \n\nComforter will come not unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you\" [John 16:7].",
