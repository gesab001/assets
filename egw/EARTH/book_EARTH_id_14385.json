    "word": "The leaven of truth, hidden in the heart, will not produce the spirit of rivalry, the love of ambition, the desire to be first. Thousands upon thousands of those to whom God has entrusted talents to be improved and increased that they may bring all their consecrated ability into the kingdom of God, become slaves to gold and silver and earthly possessions. They abuse their entrusted capabilities, and scheme and plan to obtain those things which have no value with God. They buy and sell and get gain, but they neglect to secure those precious things which are placed within their reach--the bread of life, the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.",
