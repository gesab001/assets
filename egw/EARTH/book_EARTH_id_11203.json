    "word": "Light is a blessing, a universal blessing, pouring forth its treasures on a world unthankful, unholy, demoralized. So it is with the light of the Sun of Righteousness. The whole earth, wrapped as it is in the darkness of sin, and sorrow, and pain, is to be lighted with the knowledge of God\u2019s love. From no sect, rank, or class of people is the light shining from heaven\u2019s throne to be excluded.",
