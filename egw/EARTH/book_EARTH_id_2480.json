    "word": "God always has been. He is the great I AM. The psalmist declares, \"Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.\" Psalm 90:2. He is the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity. \"I am the Lord, I change not,\" He declares. With Him there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. He is \"the same yesterday, and to day and for ever.\" Hebrews 13:8. He is infinite and omnipresent. No words of ours can describe His greatness and majesty.",
