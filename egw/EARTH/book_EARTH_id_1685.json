    "word": "God\u2019s Law Is Sustained\nBut it was not merely to accomplish the redemption of man that Christ came to the earth to suffer and to die. He came to \"magnify the law\" and to \"make it honorable.\" Not alone that the inhabitants of this world might regard the law as it should be regarded; but it was to demonstrate to all the worlds of the universe that God's law is unchangeable. Could its claims have been set aside, then the Son of God need not have yielded up His life to atone for its transgression. The death of Christ proves it immutable. And the sacrifice to which infinite love impelled the Father and the Son, that sinners might be redeemed, demonstrates to all the universe\u2014what nothing less than this plan of atonement could have sufficed to do\u2014that justice and mercy are the foundation of the law and government of God.",
