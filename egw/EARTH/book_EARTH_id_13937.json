You are most thoroughly deceived in yourself. You have a stubborn, rebellious spirit. You have been no strength to the church, but only a clog. You have a disposition to dictate and control matters, and if you cannot do this you are almost sure to be sullen and uncongenial. This is a sad thing. God is not pleased with such soldiers: they would be discharged from an earthly army in disgrace.",
