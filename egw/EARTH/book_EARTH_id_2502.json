    "word": "\"Till heaven and earth pass,\" said Jesus, \"one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\" Matthew 5:18. The sun shining in the heavens, the solid earth upon which you dwell, are God's witnesses that His law is changeless and eternal. Though they may pass away, the divine precepts shall endure. \"It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.\" Luke 16:17. . . .",
