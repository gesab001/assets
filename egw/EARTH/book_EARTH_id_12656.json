    "word": "There are many in this world who would concede the principles of right for some worldly advantage. There are many who would forfeit their rectitude for gold, or position, or power. But of what advantage is it to sacrifice your hopes of heaven for earthly wealth and honor? You can not take your treasure with you to the grave. Only a little while at the longest, and life will be past, and \"what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" We should fix our eyes on something more enduring. The home of the saints is more worthy of our toil and affection; for it is \"an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away.\" 1 Peter 1:3, 4.",
