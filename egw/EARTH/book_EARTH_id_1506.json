    "word": "Chap. 42 - The Peril of Covetousness\n\n     Many of the people of God are stupefied by the spirit of the world, and are denying their faith by their works. They cultivate a love for money, for houses and lands, until it absorbs the powers of mind and being, and shuts out love for the Creator and for souls for whom Christ died. The god of this world has blinded their eyes; their eternal interests are made secondary; and brain, bone, and muscle are taxed to the utmost to increase their worldly possessions. And all this accumulation of cares and burdens is borne in direct violation of the injunction of Christ, who said, \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal.\"",
