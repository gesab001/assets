    "word": "Of Abraham it is written that \"he was called the Friend of God\" (James 2:23), \"the father of all them that believe\" (Romans 4:11). The testimony of God concerning this faithful patriarch is \"Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws\" (Genesis 26:5). . . . It was a high honor to which Abraham was called, that of being the father of the people who for centuries were the guardians and preservers of the truth of God for the world--of that people through whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed in the advent of the promised Messiah.",
