    "word": "Remember that a large number of angels were cast out of heaven because of rebellion. These angels are continually striving to turn into wrong channels the minds of those who are seeking to obey the Lord. But if you will walk in the path of obedience to God's requirements, He will watch over you and guard you from evil. He will strengthen you and cause you to ride upon the high places of the earth.",
