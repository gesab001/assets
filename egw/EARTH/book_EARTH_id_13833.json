    "word": "Already kingdom is rising against kingdom. There is not now a determined engagement. As yet the four winds are held until the servants of our God shall be sealed in their foreheads. Then the power of earth will marshal their forces for the last great battle. How carefully should we improve the little remaining period of our probation. How earnestly should we examine ourselves. How [earnestly] should we consider and cherish faith before God. How [earnestly] should we eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God, that is, carefully study the Word, eat it, digest it, make it a part of our being. We are to live the Word, not keep it apart from our lives. The character of Christ is to be our individual character. We are to be transformed by the renewing of our hearts. Here is our only safety. Nothing can prevail to separate a living Christian from God.",
