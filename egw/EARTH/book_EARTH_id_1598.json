    "word": "Chap. 32 - A Deeper Consecration\n\n     The teachers employed in our schools should be acquainted with God by an experimental knowledge. They should know Him because they obey all the commandments He has given. Jehovah engraved His Ten Commandments on tables of stone, that all the inhabitants of earth might understand His eternal, unchangeable character. Those teachers who desire to advance in learning and proficiency need to lay hold of these wonderful revelations of God. But it is only as heart and mind are brought into harmony with God that they will understand the divine requirements.",
