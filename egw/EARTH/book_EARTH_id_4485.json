    "word": "\u201c\u2018At our usual supper-time, we prepared poor Nathaniel's supper, but he soon said that he was faint, and did not know but he was going to die. He sent for me, and as soon as I entered the room, I knew that he was dying, and said to him, \u201cNathaniel dear, trust in God, he loves you, and you love him. Trust right in him as a child trusts in its parents.\u201d Don't be troubled. The Lord will not leave you. Said he, \u201cYes, yes.\u201d We prayed and he responded, \u201cAmen, praise the Lord!\u201d He did not seem to suffer pain. He did not groan once, nor struggle, nor move a muscle of his face, but breathed shorter and shorter until he fell asleep.\u2019 The following lines occasioned by his death, were written by Sister Annie R. Smith:\u2014 \n\n\n     \u201cGone to thy rest, brother! peaceful thy sleep; \n      While o'er thy grave bending, in sorrow we weep, \n      For the loved and the cherished, in life's early bloom, \n      Borne from our number, to the cold, silent tomb. \n\n\n     \u201cSweet be thy slumber! in quiet repose; \n      Beneath the green turf, and the blossoming rose; \n      Oh, soft is thy pillow, and lowly thy bed; \n      Mournful the cypress that waves o'er the dead. \n\n\n     \u201cDark though the pinion that shaded his brow, \n      The truth which he followed illumined it now; \n      In the arms of his Saviour he fell to his rest, \n      Where woes that await us pervade not his breast. \n301\n\n     \u201cWeep not for the Christian whose labor is done; \n      Who, faithful to duty, the treasure has won, \n      The jewel was fitted forever to shine, \n      A gem in the casket, immortal, divine. \n\n\n     \u201cNot long will earth's bosom his precious form hide, \n      And death's gloomy portals from kindred divine; \n      For swiftly approaching, we see the bright day, \n      That brings the glad summons, Arise! come away!",
