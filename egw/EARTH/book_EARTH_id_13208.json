    "word": "I feel no spirit of hatred against the poor prejudiced souls who are deluded and blinded by error, and are in so great darkness they trample under foot the law of God. They are so filled with bitterness against this holy law, the foundation of God's government in heaven and in earth, they cannot find words sufficiently strong to express their contempt of God's law, which the inspired Apostle calls \"holy, and just, and good.\" (Romans 7:12.) I have left my case in the hands of God. He knows all. He can hold in check the prejudices and opposition of our enemies. He can turn their devices against themselves. He can make their bitter speeches and their enmity rebound upon their own heads.",
