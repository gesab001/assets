    "word": "God's laws for nature are obeyed by nature. Cloud and storm, sunshine and shower, dew and rain, all are under the supervision of God and yield obedience to His command. In obedience to the law of God the spire of grain bursts through the earth, \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear\" (Mark 4:28). The fruit is seen in the bud, and the Lord develops it in its proper season because it does not resist His working. . . .",
