    "word": "The joy of the Lord is our strength. Shall we remember these words? We know that God is true, and that all His ways are just and right. All God expects of us is to live each day as if it were our last on earth, surrendering ourselves to Him to do His will. As He is perfect in knowledge, so is He perfect in wisdom. The best use and improvement of knowledge is to heed the instruction of Christ, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" \n\n                                               -\n \n\n\n                                  -177-",
