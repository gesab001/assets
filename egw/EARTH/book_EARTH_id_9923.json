    "word": "God tests men, some in one way, and some in another. He tests some by bestowing upon them His rich bounties, and others by withholding His favors. He proves the rich to see if they will love God, the Giver, and their neighbor as themselves. When man makes a right use of these bounties, God is pleased; He can then trust him with greater responsibilities. The Lord reveals man's relative estimate of time and eternity, of earth and heaven. He has admonished us: \"If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.\" They have a value when used for the good of others and the glory of God; but no earthly treasure is to be your portion, your god, or your savior.",
