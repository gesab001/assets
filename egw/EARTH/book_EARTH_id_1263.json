    "word": "Man cannot meet these charges himself. In his sin-stained garments, confessing his guilt, he stands before God. But Jesus our Advocate presents an effectual plea in behalf of all who by repentance and faith have committed the keeping of their souls to Him. He pleads their cause and vanquishes their accuser by the mighty arguments of Calvary. His perfect obedience to God's law, even unto the death of the cross, has given Him all power in heaven and in earth, and He claims of His Father mercy and reconciliation for guilty man. To the accuser of His people He declares: \"'The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.' These are the purchase of My blood, brands plucked from the burning.\" Those who rely upon Him in faith receive the comforting assurance: \"Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.\"",
