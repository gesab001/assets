    "word": "Calamities in San Francisco and Mountain View.--I \n\n178 \n\nam instructed to say to laborers in San Francisco and Oakland, and also in Mountain View: Let every worker remember that he is under most solemn obligation to labor in accordance with the Lord's plan. Let our brethren and sisters engaged in the Lord's work realize their great accountability to God at this time, in view of the special calamities that have come to San Francisco [earthquake and fire of April 18, 1906] and to the office in Mountain View. Let them consider and take heed. Let everyone engaged in the work examine his individual standing before God. . . .",
