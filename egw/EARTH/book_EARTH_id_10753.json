    "word": "Through His inspired apostle Christ has presented to us the measure of the character that is imbued with the love of Christ. We are to bear the marks of Christ, we are to have His likeness. This example is given us that we may know the possibilities, the heights we may reach in and through Christ. The standard He presents is perfection in Him, and through His merits we may attain to it. We come short because we are content to look at earthly things rather than at heavenly. It is by beholding Christ that we are changed from glory to glory. The eye that views common things needs to be elevated. . . .",
