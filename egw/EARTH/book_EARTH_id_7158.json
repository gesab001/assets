    "word": "Our Mission for Christ \n\n     Christ said: \"No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he \n                                                                           265\nto whomsoever the Son will reveal him\" (Matthew 11:27). O how dimly the exalted work of the Son of God is comprehended! He held the salvation of the world in His hands. The commission given to the apostles is also given to His followers in this age. \"Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem\" (Luke 24:47). Our Saviour has \"all power...in heaven and in earth\" (Matthew 28:18), and this power is promised unto us. \"Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth\" (Acts 1:8).",
