    "word": "The Spirit of God is moving upon men's hearts, and those who respond to His influence will become lights in the world. Everywhere they are seen going forth to communicate to others the light they have received, as they did after the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. And as they let their light shine they receive more and more of the Spirit's power. The earth is lighted with the glory of God.--Australasian Union Conference Record, Apr. 1, 1898.",
