    "word": "Time is precious. The destiny of souls is in the balance. At infinite cost a way of salvation has been provided. Shall Christ\u2019s great sacrifice be in vain? Shall the earth be entirely controlled by satanic agencies? The salvation of souls is dependent upon the consecration and activity of God\u2019s church. The Lord calls all who believe in Him to be workers together with Him. While their life shall last, they are not to feel that their work is done. Until the time comes when Christ shall say, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d His work for the saving of souls will not decrease, but will grow in importance.",
