    "word": "When Christ was upon the earth, he used every means possible to gain admission to the hearts of those whose doors should have been thrown open to receive him. He came to his vineyard seeking fruit. He dug about the vine he had planted. He pruned it and dressed it. But when he looked for grapes, behold, only wild grapes rewarded his care. The people disappointed their Saviour.",
