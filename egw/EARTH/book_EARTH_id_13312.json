    "word": "But just as the Lord led His people to Rephidim of old, so He may bring us there also, in order to test our faithfulness and loyalty to Him. In mercy to us He does not always place us in the easiest places. If He did, in our self-sufficiency we would forget that the Lord is our helper in our time of necessity. But He longs to manifest Himself to us in our emergency, and reveal the abundant supplies that are at our disposal, independent of our surroundings. Disappointment and trial are permitted to come upon us that we may realize our own helplessness, and learn to call upon the Lord for help as a child, when hungry and thirsty, calls upon an earthly father.",
