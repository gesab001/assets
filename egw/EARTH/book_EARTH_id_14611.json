    "word": "Many in the church allow things of an earthly nature to interpose between the soul and heaven. They have not a right conception of the character of God. They do not perceive His matchless love; and faith and love die out of their hearts. Many minds are confused. They cannot discern spiritual things, and they are unable to distinguish the voice of the true Shepherd from that of a stranger. How necessary it is that such should study the message that God has given, lest they be swept away by the overwhelming delusions of the enemy.",
