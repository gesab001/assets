    "word": "The three angels of Revelation 14 represent the people who accept the light of God's messages and go forth as His agents to sound the warning throughout the length and breadth of the earth. Christ declares to His followers: \"Ye are the light of the world.\" Matthew 5:14. To every soul that accepts Jesus the cross of Calvary speaks: \"Behold the worth of the soul: 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.'\" Mark 16:15. Nothing is to be permitted to hinder this work. It is the all-important work for time; it is to be far-reaching as eternity. The love that Jesus manifested for the souls of men in the sacrifice which He made for their redemption, will actuate all His followers.  5T 455, 45633",
