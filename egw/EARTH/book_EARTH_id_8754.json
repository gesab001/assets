    "word": "Chapter XXXIII. - Vision at Monterey.\n\n     October, 1857, we visited the church at Monterey, Mich. There was an evening meeting appointed at the school-house near Bro. George Lay's and an expectation to hear preaching. My husband went to the house feeling that he had nothing for the people. He told the brethren on the way that he could not decide on any subject and wished them to select. A hymn was sung, and my husband prayed with much freedom. After singing again my husband gave liberty to others to improve the time. I felt impressed to speak, and was greatly blest in speaking, and sat down, and was soon lost to earthly things. For further description of that meeting I copy the following from my husband's report in Review for Oct. 22, 1857:",
