    "word": "Chapter XLI - Desolation of the Earth\n     \u201cHer sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.\u201d \u201cIn the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her; for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, . . . saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.\u201d [Revelation 18:5-10, 3, 15-17.]",
