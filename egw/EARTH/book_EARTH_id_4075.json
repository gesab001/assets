    "word": "Angels of God are watching over us. Upon this earth there are thousands and tens of thousands of heavenly messengers commissioned by the Father to prevent Satan from obtaining any advantage over those who refuse to walk in the path of evil. And these angels who guard God's children on earth are in communication with the Father in heaven. \"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones,\" Christ said; \"for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 18:10).",
