    "word": "Love, mercy, and compassion were displayed in every act of Jesus ministry.--In describing His earthly mission, Jesus said, \"The Lord hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.\" This was His work. He went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by Satan. There were whole villages where there was not a moan of sickness in any house; for He had passed through them, and healed all their sick. His work gave evidence of His divine anointing. Love, mercy, and compassion were displayed in every act of His life. His heart went out in tender sympathy to the children of men. He took man's nature, that He might reach man's wants. The poorest and\n284\nhumblest were not afraid to approach Him. Even little children were attracted to Him. They loved to climb upon His knees, and gaze into that pensive face, benignant with love.--BTS Jan. 1, 1909.",
