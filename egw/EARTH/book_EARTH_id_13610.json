    "word": "Those who delight to criticize their brethren pride themselves on their superior wisdom in discerning stains upon the character that others have not discovered; but \"this wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\"",
