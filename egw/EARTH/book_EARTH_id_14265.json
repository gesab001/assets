    "word": "Do we consider from day to day that a record is going up to heaven of all our actions here? If we would take heed to our ways, and if we would have the fear of God before us, our lives would be far better than they are today. We are here as probationers, on trial. God is testing us; God is proving us to see what characters we shall build up. Angels of God in heaven are sent to our earth to weigh moral worth. And our heavenly Father has sent us the message of warning, that we shall get ready for that day of final reckoning. He has bid us to watch and pray lest we enter into temptation that surrounds us. He has bid us to \"search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me\" [John 5:39]. \n\n\n                                     -26-",
