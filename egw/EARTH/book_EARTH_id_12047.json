    "word": "This is no time to criticise, but every breath devoted to this matter should be used in speaking words that shall encourage, and every power to actions that shall lift. If those who can, will give of their means to help the work in this field, it will be returning to the Lord but a small portion of the mercies and blessings which he has given them. All his gifts are entrusted to us, to be used when he requires his own to carry forward his work in the earth. Shall we not then make an effort, a firm, strong, united effort, helping, not selfishly nor grudgingly, but cheerfully and uncomplainingly?",
