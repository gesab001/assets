    "word": "In His life on earth, Christ developed a perfect character, He rendered perfect obedience to His Father's commandments. In coming to the world in human form, in becoming subject to the law, in revealing to men that He bore their sickness, their sorrow, their guilt, He did not become a sinner. Before the Pharisees He could say, \"Which of you convinceth me of sin?\" Not one stain of sin was found upon Him. He stood before the world the spotless Lamb of God.--The Youth's Instructor, Dec. 29, 1898.",
