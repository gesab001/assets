    "word": "The people are encouraged to center in Battle Creek, and they pay their tithe and give their influence to the building up of a modern Jerusalem that is not after God's order. In this work other places are cut off from facilities which they should have. Enlarge ye, spread, yes: but not in one place. Go out and establish centers of influence in places where nothing or next to nothing has been done. Break up your consolidated mass; diffuse the saving beams of light, and shed beams into the darkened corners of the earth. A work needs to be done something like that which is described as an eagle stirring up her nest. \"Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he is settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.\" This is true of many Christians who are coming into Battle Creek. Many have a spasmodic zeal in battle, but it is like a meteor that flashes across the heavens, and goes out. Let God's own workmen, who have his cause at heart, do something for the southern field. Let not God's stewards be content with just touching it with their fingers edge. Let those at the heart of the work plan for the field in earnest. You have talked about it; but what are you doing as the stewards of God's means? Why do you feel at liberty to bind God's capital about, and hold it at Battle Creek? Why do you do the very things that God has warned you not to do? The case is becoming serious; for warnings and entreaties \n                                                                           1419\nhave been given in vain. You are extending the mere arms of power at Battle Creek more and more widely, seeking to control the whole work far and near, and crush out that which you cannot control. I lift my voice in protest. The spirit that now controls is not the spirit of the Lord.",
