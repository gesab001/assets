    "word": "If I act conscientiously, I must meet the crisis; for I believe that the precepts which the Lord has given concerning his work in the past and at the present time point out the right way.

God's voice is to be heard; his wisdom is to guide us. We must not be broken up by any human wisdom of devising. God has outlined his plan in his Word and in the Testimonies he has sent to his people.",
