    "word": "Modern Attitude Toward Prophetic Truth.--As of old, the plain testimony of God's Word was met with the inquiry, \"Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed?\" And finding how difficult a task it was to refute the arguments drawn from the prophetic periods, many discouraged the study of the prophecies, teaching that the prophetic books were sealed, and were not to be understood. Multitudes, trusting implicitly to their pastors, refused to listen to the warning; and others, though convinced of the truth, dared not confess it, lest they should be \"put out of the synagogue.\" The message which God had sent for the testing and purification of the church, revealed all too surely how great was the number who had set their affections on this world rather than upon Christ. The ties which bound them to earth were stronger than the attractions heavenward. They chose to listen to the voice of worldly wisdom, and turned away from the heartsearching message of truth.--The Great Controversy, p. 380. (1888)",
