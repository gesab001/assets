    "word": "One of Christ's most beautiful and impressive parables is that of the sower and the seed. \"So is the kingdom of God,\" He said, \"as if a man should cast seed into the ground; and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" Mark 4:26-28. . . . He who gave this parable, Himself created the tiny seed, gave it its vital properties, and ordained the laws that should govern its growth; and He made it a living illustration of truth in both the natural and the spiritual world.",
