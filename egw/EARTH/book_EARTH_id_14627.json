    "word": "From Olivet Christ looked upon Jerusalem, and with trembling lips and grief-burdened soul he said, if thou hadst known, even thou, in this thy day the things that belong unto thy peace: but now they are hid from thy eyes. He thought of what Jerusalem might have been had she maintained a living connection with God, of what blessings might have rested upon the people had they improved their privileges and blessings they enjoyed through the mercy and grace of a long suffering God. Jerusalem would have become beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth. God would have made Zion his holy habitation.",
