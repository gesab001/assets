    "word": "Christ wrought miracle after miracle when He was on this earth. In this work He showed what God can do for afflicted bodies and souls. . . . He was constantly ministering to others, improving every opportunity offered Him. Even in His childhood He spoke words of comfort and tenderness to young and old. . . . He was an example of what all children may strive to be. . . . In His words and actions He manifested tender sympathy for all. His companionship was a healing, soothing balm to the disheartened and depressed.",
