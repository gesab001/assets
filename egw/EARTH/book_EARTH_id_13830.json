    "word": "God gives no man a message that it will be ten years or twenty years before this earth's history shall close. If it were forty or one hundred years, the Lord would not authorize men to proclaim it. He would not give any living being an excuse for delaying the preparation for His appearing. He would have no one say, as did the unfaithful servant, \"My Lord delayeth His coming,\" for this leads to reckless neglect of opportunities and privileges to prepare for that great day. Every soul who claims to be a servant of God is called to do his service as if every day might be the last.",
