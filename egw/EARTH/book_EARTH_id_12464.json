    "word": "God's Wondrous Love. \n\n     \"If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us;\" and that love cannot be restrained. \"God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\" Only by becoming partakers of the divine nature, can the law of God be fulfilled by men. Only he who loves God with all his heart, soul, mind, and \n\n\n                      -5- \n\nstrength, and his neighbor as himself, can give glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, good will to men. This was the work of Christ; and when his work is appreciated and represented by his followers, the great result will be achieved in the \"joy that was set before him\" in the saving of the souls for whom he gave his life.",
