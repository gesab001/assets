The family of heaven and the family of earth are one. For us our Lord ascended, and for us He lives. \"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them\" (Hebrews 7:25) (The Desire of Ages, pp. 834, 835). \n                                                                           104",
