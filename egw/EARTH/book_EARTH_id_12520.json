    "word": "And why is it that these blessings are so continually given, notwithstanding the perversity and ingratitude of the human hearts that are blessed with these earthly treasures? The answer is easy of comprehension, and all may understand it. It is through the incarnation of the Son of God. He was rich in majesty, in honor, and in glory; but for the sake of saving the heritage of God, he became poor \"that ye through his poverty might be rich.\" The saving power of the Holy Spirit was sent to guide men into all truth. Light, life, and immortality were brought to light through the infinite sacrifice of the only begotten Son of God. And this self-denial and self-sacrifice is to be represented to the world in the character of all who are true Christian,--not professors merely, but those who are following the requirements of Jesus Christ. God desires that we shall be Christlike, that we shall bear his image, imitate his example, and like him, live the law of God in our daily life.",
