    "word": "Deeds Preserved Through Eternal Ages \n\n     God's messengers are to hold aloft the standard of truth until the hand is palsied in death.  When they sleep in death, the places that once knew them know them no more.  The churches in which they preached, the places they visited to hold forth the word of life, still remain.  The mountains, the hills, the things seen by mortal vision, are still there.  All these things must at last pass away.  The time is coming when the earth shall reel to and fro and shall be removed like a cottage.  But \n                                                                           153\nthe thoughts, the purposes, the acts of God's workers, although now unseen, will appear at the great day of final retribution and reward.  Things now forgotten will then appear as witnesses, either to approve or to condemn.",
