    "word": "The world's Redeemer had many hearers, but few followers. Noah preached one hundred and twenty years to the people before the flood, and yet there were few who appreciated this precious, probationary time. Save Noah and his family, not one was numbered with the believers and entered into the ark. Out of all the population of the earth, only eight souls received the message; but that message condemned the world. The light was given that they might believe; their rejection of the light proved their ruin. Our message to the world will be a savor of life unto life to all who accept it, and of condemnation to those who reject it.",
