    "word": "Every truly converted soul will be intensely desirous to bring others from the darkness of error into the marvelous light of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. The great outpouring of the Spirit of God which lightens the whole earth with His glory will not come until we have an enlightened people who know by experience what it means to be laborers together with God. When we have entire, wholehearted consecration to the service of Christ, God will recognize the fact by an outpouring of His Spirit without measure; but this will not be while the largest portion of the church are not laborers together with God. God cannot pour out His Spirit when selfishness and self-indulgence is so manifest, when a spirit prevails that if put into words would express that answer of Cain,--\"Am I my brother's keeper?\" Letter 31, 1894, p. 11. (To Mr. Harper, September 23, 1894.)",
