    "word": "In the past, Christ had been approached through forms and ceremonies, but now He was upon the earth, calling attention directly to Himself, presenting a spiritual priesthood, and placing the sinful human agent at the footstool of mercy. \"Ask, and it shall be given you,\" He promised; \"seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" \"If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it. If ye love Me, keep My commandments.\" \"He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me: . . . and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.\" \"As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you: continue ye in My love. If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.\"",
