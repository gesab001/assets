    "word": "Christ inculcates the value of obedience, saying, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" Is it not best for us to keep the commandments, so that through us God can reveal His power? If all God's people were obeying His commandments, they would indeed be lights in the world.",
