    "word": "The Lord Jesus has placed Himself under obligation never to disappoint a true seeker for the Holy Spirit's guidance. He presents the earthly to represent the heavenly. He appeals to the love of earthly parents. \"What man is there among you,\" He says, \"who if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone, or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent? If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give good gifts to them that ask Him?\"--Letter 68, 1900, p. 10. (To Elder and Mrs. J. E. White, May 4, 1900.)",
