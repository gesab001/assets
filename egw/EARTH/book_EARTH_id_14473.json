    "word": "\"Man's authority bears the signature of man. We are not to permit the rank and file of our people to come under the generalship of the weak, mixed-up sentiments of man. God's authority is to stand supreme in its moral dignity and power. And I must call upon the people of God to recognize His authority, and authority which bears the evidence of its divine origin, and which is commendable and acceptable in the sight of His children on the earth and in the whole heavenly universe. Every soul is called upon to connect himself inseparably with God's authority.",
