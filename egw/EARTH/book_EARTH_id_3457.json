    "word": "Upon the crystal sea before the throne, that sea of glass as it were mingled with fire,\u2014so resplendent is it with the glory of God,\u2014are gathered the company that have \u201cgotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name.\u201d [Revelation 15:2.] With the Lamb upon Mount Zion, \u201chaving the harps of God,\u201d they stand, \n649\nthe hundred and forty and four thousand that were redeemed from among men; and there is heard, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of a great thunder, \u201cthe voice of harpers harping with their harps.\u201d [Revelation 14:1-5; 15:3; 7:14-17] And they sing \u201ca new song\u201d before the throne, a song which no man can learn save the hundred and forty and four thousand. It is the song of Moses and the Lamb,\u2014a song of deliverance. None but the hundred and forty-four thousand can learn that song; for it is the song of their experience,\u2014an experience such as no other company have ever had. \u201cThese are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.\u201d These, having been translated from the earth, from among the living, are counted as \u201cthe first-fruits unto God and to the Lamb.\u201d \u201cThese are they which came out of great tribulation;\u201d [Revelation 14:1-5; 15:3; Revelation 7:14-17.] they have passed through the time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation; they have endured the anguish of the time of Jacob's trouble; they have stood without an intercessor through the final outpouring of God's judgments. But they have been delivered, for they have \u201cwashed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\u201d \u201cIn their mouth was found no guile; for they are without fault\u201d before God. \u201cTherefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.\u201d [Revelation 14:1-5; 15:3; Revelation 7:14-17.] They have seen the earth wasted with famine and pestilence, the sun having power to scorch men with great heat, and they themselves have endured suffering, hunger, and thirst. But \u201cthey shall hunger no more; neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat; for the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\u201d [Revelation 14:1-5; 15:3; 7:14-17.]",
