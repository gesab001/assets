    "word": "\u201cBehold, the sower went forth to sow; and as he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them\u201d (R.V.); \u201csome fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth; and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.\u201d",
