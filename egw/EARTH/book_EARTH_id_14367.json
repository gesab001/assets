    "word": "Do you believe it? I do, and I believe it because I have the evidence in me, the sure promise of One who is Truth. I have no right to be comfortless in this world, for it needs light.

After He ascended, He fulfilled His promise. He sends the Comforter to be with every believing, obedient child, wherever he may be.",
