    "word": "When reason is awakening, the mind is most susceptible, and so the very first lessons are of great importance. \n\n294 \n\nThese lessons have a powerful influence in the formation of character. If they are of the right stamp, and if, as the child advances in years, they are followed up with patient perseverance, the earthly and the eternal destiny will be shaped for good.
