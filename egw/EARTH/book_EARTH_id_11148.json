    "word": "In the beginning, God looked upon all He had made, and pronounced it very good. The curse was brought upon the earth in consequence of sin. But shall this curse be multiplied by increasing sin? Ignorance is doing its baleful work. Slothful servants are increasing the evil by their lazy habits. . . . But the earth has blessings hidden in its depths for those who have courage and will and perseverance to gather its treasures.\u2014Ibid., pp. 315-327.",
