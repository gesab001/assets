    "word": "He who is unfair in the least will be unfair also in much. Those who grasp all the advantages they can for the work in their portion of the field, selfishly refusing to help their fellow workers, are unwise stewards. They help that portion of the vineyard in which they are interested, allowing other portions to get along as they can. They say, I will take care of the things under my supervision. But the Lord is greatly displeased by this course of action. He has given them his means for wise consideration of all doing his service and wise distribution. His workmen pray to him for facilities with which to work, while those to whom he has given his means, the very means to answer these prayers, neglect his work, allowing his workers to lose their time and wear out their strength in working against disadvantages which need not be. These selfish stewards have not the mind of Christ. They do not say, All we are brethren. We will share our blessings, that our fellow-workers, whom God has sent into the new field, may have a chance to invest the Lord's abundant provision in other portions of the vineyard. We will help our fellow workers out of their difficulty, that the Lord's work may be a praise in all parts of the earth.",
