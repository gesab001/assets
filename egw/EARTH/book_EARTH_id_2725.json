    "word": "Christ declares the mission He had in coming to the earth. He says in His last public prayer, \"O righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee: but I have known Thee, and \n                                                                           178\nthese have known that Thou hast sent Me. And I have declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it; that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them.\" When Moses asked the Lord to show him His glory, the Lord said, \"I will make all My goodness pass before thee.\" \"And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty. . . . And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.\" When we are able to comprehend the character of God as did Moses, we too shall make haste to bow in adoration and praise. Jesus contemplated nothing less than \"that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me\" should be in the hearts of His children, that they might impart the knowledge of God to others.",
