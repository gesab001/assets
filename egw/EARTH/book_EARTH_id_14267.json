    "word": "The God of heaven has given us reasoning powers and intellect, and He wants us to use them. He has given us this body which He wishes us to preserve in perfect health so that we can give Him perfect service. The Lord God is an ever present witness to the deeds of wickedness done among the  children of men upon this earth. How does He look upon men and women for whom He has paid an infinite price but who yet refuse to obey His laws? They refuse to be saved in His appointed way, which is entire obedience to His commandments.",
