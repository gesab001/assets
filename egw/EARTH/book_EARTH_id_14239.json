    "word": "The Authority of the Church \n     The world's Redeemer has invested great power with His church. He states the rules to be applied in cases of trial with its members. After He has given explicit directions as to the course to be pursued, He says, \"Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever (in church discipline) ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" Thus even the heavenly authority ratifies the discipline of the church in regard to its members, when the Bible rule has been followed.",
