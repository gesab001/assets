    "word": "Jesus came to this earth to stand at the head of humanity. He passed through all the phases of human experience, and at the end died on the cross that we might be saved. He became poor, that we by following in His steps in meekness and lowliness of heart, might become wise unto salvation, and rich with the eternal reward that is for everyone who will accept the invitation, \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" (Matthew 11:29, 30).",
