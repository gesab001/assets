    "word": "Christ, the Word, the only begotten of God, was one with the eternal Father,--one in nature, in character, in purpose,--the only being that could enter into all the counsels and purposes of God. \"His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\" His \"goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.\" And the Son of God declares concerning Himself: \"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting. . . . When he appointed the foundations of the earth: then I was by him, as one brought up with him\" (Isaiah 9:6; Micah 5:2; Proverbs 8:22-30).",
