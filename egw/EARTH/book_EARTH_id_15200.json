    "word": "September 22, 1898 \n\n\n                     Bible Teaching in our Schools \n\n\n     A revival in Bible study is needed throughout the world. Attention is to be called, not to the assertions of men, but to the Word of God. As this is done, a mighty work will be wrought. When God declared that his word should not return unto him, void, he meant all that he said. The gospel is to be preached to all nations. The Bible is to be opened to the people. A knowledge of God is the highest education, and it will cover the earth with its wonderful truth as the waters cover the sea.",
