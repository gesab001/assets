    "word": "Now, please let me know just what you want, as soon as possible. You see I hold out no inducement to you. Nothing would rejoice me more than to see you and your husband converted to the truth, which you know is truth. It will cost you a greater effort now than it would have done years ago; for no one can choose the path of disobedience rather than obedience and become better prepared to accept the truth which involves a cross. I think every objection was removed from your mind but one, and that is the cross. That objection no power in heaven or earth can remove. We have a great and yearning desire for every soul to receive and practice the truth, not from compulsion but because of the love of it. Heaven is worth everything to me, and your soul and the soul of your husband are of value with God. \"All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep His covenant and His testimonies.\"",
