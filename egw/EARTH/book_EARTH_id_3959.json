    "word": "Our Duty to the Sick. \n     1161. We shall find the footprints of Jesus by the sick-bed, by the side of suffering humanity, in the hovels of the poverty stricken and distressed. We may walk in these footsteps, comforting the suffering, speaking words of hope and comfort to the despondent. Doing as Jesus did when he was upon earth, we shall walk in his blessed steps.--R. and H., 1896, No. 23.",
