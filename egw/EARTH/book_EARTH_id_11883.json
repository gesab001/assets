    "word": "When Christ comes to gather to Himself those who have been faithful, the last trump will sound, and the whole earth, from the summits of the loftiest mountains to the lowest recesses of the deepest mines will hear. The righteous dead will hear the sound of the last trump, and will come forth from their graves, to be clothed with immortality, and to meet their Lord. And those who pierced the Saviour, those who scourged and crucified Him, will also be raised, to behold Him whom they mocked and despised, coming in the clouds of heaven, attended by the heavenly host, ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands.",
