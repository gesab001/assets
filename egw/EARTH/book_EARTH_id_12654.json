    "word": "If men would lay their earthly treasures upon the altar of God, and work as zealously to secure the heavenly treasure as they have the earthly, they would invest means cheerfully and gladly wherever they could see an opportunity to do good and aid the cause of their Master, who intrusted them with means to test and prove their fidelity to him. Christ has given them unmistakable evidence of his love and fidelity to them. He left Heaven, his riches and glory, and for their sakes became poor, that they through his poverty might be made rich. After he has thus condescended to save man, Christ requires no less of man than that he should deny himself, and use the means he has lent him in saving his fellow-men, and by thus doing, give evidence of his love for his Redeemer, and show that he values the salvation brought to him by such an infinite sacrifice.",
