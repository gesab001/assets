    "word": "How true are the words, \"Darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people\" [Isaiah 60:2]. Darkness covers the world like a funeral pall. This darkness is not an accident or an attribute of our moral condition, but a principle, an element, which, like evil leaven, gathers to itself all the properties it can assimilate. It is a constant darkness, pervading and overshadowing the whole world.",
