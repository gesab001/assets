    "word": "CONDITION WHILE IN VISION\n \n     ESPECIALLY DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF HER WORK, MRS. WHITE'S VISIONS WERE OFTEN GIVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY WITNESSES. DURING THESE MANIFESTATIONS SHE WAS ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS OF HER EARTHLY SURROUNDINGS. YET SHE WOULD FREQUENTLY WALK ABOUT, MAKING GRACEFUL GESTURES, WHILE DESCRIBING THE SCENES SHE WAS WITNESSING. HER STRENGTH AT SUCH TIMES WAS PHENOMENAL. STRONG MEN HAVE ENDEAVORED TO MOVE HER HAND OR ARM FROM THE POSITION IN WHICH IT WAS HELD, BUT FAILED. ON ONE OCCASION, AT THE HOME OF MR. CURTIS, IN TOPSHAM, MAINE, IN 1845, SHE TOOK FROM A BUREAU A LARGE FAMILY BIBLE WEIGHING ABOUT EIGHTEEN POUNDS, AND, HOLDING THIS AT ARM'S LENGTH ABOVE HER HEAD WITH HER LEFT HAND, SHE TURNED THE PAGES WITH HER RIGHT HAND. THEN, WITH HER EYES DIRECTED UPWARD AWAY FROM THE BOOK, SHE READ CORRECTLY MANY PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE, POINTING TO THE VERSES WITH THE INDEX FINGER OF HER RIGHT HAND. WITH HER ORDINARY STRENGTH SHE WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY EVEN IN LIFTING THIS HEAVY VOLUME; BUT WHILE SUPERNATURALLY STRENGTHENED IN VISION, SHE\n253\nHELD IT ALOFT WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARM FOR MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR.",
