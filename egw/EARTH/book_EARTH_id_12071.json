    "word": "Seventh-day Adventists, above all people in the world, should be patterns of piety, holy in heart and in conversation. I related in the presence of N. Fuller that the people whom God had chosen as his peculiar treasure, he required to be elevated, refined, sanctified; partakers of the divine nature, \n                                                                           19\nhaving escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Should they indulge in sin and iniquity who make so high a profession, their guilt would be very great, their sin of great magnitude in his sight. He would reprove the sins of one, that others might take warning, and fear. The warnings, corrections, and reproofs, are not given to the erring because their lives are more blameworthy than professed Christians of the nominal churches, or because their acts and example are worse than the Adventists who will not yield obedience to the claims of God's law; but because they have great light, and have by their profession taken their position as God's special, chosen people, having the law of God written in their hearts. They signify their loyalty to the God of Heaven by yielding obedience to the laws of his government. They are God's representatives upon the earth. Any sin or transgression in them, separates them from God, and, in a special manner, dishonors his name by giving the enemies of God's holy law occasion to reproach his cause and his people, whom he has called \"a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,\" that they should show forth the praises of Him that hath called them out of darkness into his marvelous light.",
