    "word": "I ask you, my brethren and sisters, to do what you can to help, and to do it now. Let your means be invested in this work that is so far-reaching. This is the work of God. He has given us great advantages for the carrying on of His work; He now calls for the advantage of your means, that many may be qualified to go forth to finish up His work in the earth. The Lord will reward all who come forward in emergencies, and do their best. Those who can help should be deeply interested in preparing the way for those who wish to be qualified as missionaries for God. My brethren, and sisters, work for God with your means while you have opportunity. In doing this, you will be using your talent to His name's glory. \n                                  (Signed) Mrs. E. G.
