    "word": "In God's sight we are all little children. Those who have grown up to manhood and womanhood, those who have acquired the greatest amount of learning, those who stand at the head of the nobility of this earth, those to whose lot has fallen much of the riches and honor of this world, are in God's sight no more than little children. They are counted by Him as the small dust of the balance. \"What is man,\" the psalmist inquires, \"that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that Thou visitest him?\" \"Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust \n\n\n             -222- \n\nof the balance: behold, He taketh up the isles as a very little thing.\"",
