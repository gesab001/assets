    "word": "In the past, Christ had been approached through forms and ceremonies, but now he was upon the earth, calling attention directly to himself, presenting a spiritual priesthood, and placing the sinful human agent at the footstool of mercy. \"Ask, and it shall be given you,\" he promised; \"seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" \"If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it. If ye love me, keep my commandments.\" \"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\" \"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\"",
