    "word": "I use my limb carefully, but last night the pain in the ankle seemed unendurable. I could not sleep but I could pray, and the Lord, who has relieved me so many times, helped me. Our Saviour has told us to call upon Him. I have felt so thankful for that prayer Christ taught His disciples. It embraces everything for the inhabitants of the earth. Toward morning I slept, and when I awoke the pain was gone. I realize now the Lord was merciful, and I will praise Him in whom is my dependence and my trust. The Lord be praised.",
