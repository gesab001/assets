    "word": "God placed His church in the earth that it might be the light of the world. But the self-indulgent course of many church-members, and the rising up of self to take the lines of control, have resulted in diffusing darkness rather than light. God's professing people need to seek Him in sincere sorrow of heart, because there is so little life in the church, so little effort put forth to let the light shine in good works. \"We are laborers together with God,\" the apostle Paul declares: \"ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.\" God designs that life-giving beams shall, through the individual members of the church, shine forth to the world. Receiving that light from the Source of all light, they are to reflect that light to others. But this can be done only as the church draws near to God and lives in close connection with the Giver of life and light. The purity and simplicity of Christ, revealed in the lives of His humble followers, will witness to the possession of genuine piety. The believer who is imbued with a true missionary spirit, will be a living epistle, known and read of all men. He is a partaker of the divine nature, and \n                                                                           11\ntherefore escapes the corruptions that are in the world through lust.",
