    "word": "[Jesus] walked once a man on earth, His divinity clothed with humanity, a suffering, tempted man, beset with Satan's devices. . . . Now He is at the right hand of God, He is in heaven as our advocate, making intercession for us. We must always take comfort and hope as we think of this. He is thinking of those who are subject to temptations in this world. He thinks of us individually, and knows our every necessity. When tempted, just say, He cares for me, He makes intercession for me, He loves me, He has died for me. I will give myself unreservedly to Him.",
