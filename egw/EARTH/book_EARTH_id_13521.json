    "word": "The lesson we have to learn is that which John the Baptist had learned: \"He must increase, but I must decrease.\" Such discipline is painful to human nature, \"nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness.\" \"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is henceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.\" It is the dragon that is wroth; it is the spirit of Satan that is revealed in anger and accusing. Not a semblance of the dragon's spirit must be seen in the life or the character of Christ's servants. The testimony you bear is to be a testimony to the truth as it is in Jesus.",
