    "word": "The heathen in their blindness bow down to idols of wood and stone. \u201cThese be our gods,\u201d they say. But in the fourth commandment we have the proof that our God is the true and living God. In it is the seal of His authority: \u201c. . . For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it.\u201d In the heavens that declare the glory of their Maker\u2014the sun, shining in its strength, giving life and beauty to all created things; the moon, and the stars, the works of His hands\u2014we see the superiority of the God we worship. He is the God that \u201cmade the earth and the heavens.\u201d\u2014Bible Echo, Oct. 12, 1896.",
