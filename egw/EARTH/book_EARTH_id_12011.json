    "word": "Oh, what amazing privileges are proffered us! \n\n                       [15] \n\nWill we put forth most earnest efforts to form this alliance with Christ, through which alone these blessings are attained? Will we break off our sins by righteousness, and our iniquities by turning unto the Lord? Skepticism and infidelity are wide-spread. Christ asked the question, \"When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\" We must cherish a living, active faith. The permanence of our faith is the condition of our union.",
