    "word": "In Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Creator, and the prophecy brings to view a class that, as the result of the threefold message, are keeping the commandments of God. One of these commandments points directly to God as the Creator. The fourth precept declares: \u201cThe seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. . . . For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\u201d [Exodus 20:10, 11.] Concerning the Sabbath, the Lord says, further, that it is \u201ca sign, . . . that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.\u201d [Ezekiel 20:20.] And the reason given is, \u201cFor in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.\u201d [Exodus 31:17.]",
