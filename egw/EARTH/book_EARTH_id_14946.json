    "word": "J. A. Burden: The governments of earth provide that if we conduct a medical school we must take a charter from the (757) government. That in itself has nothing to do with how the school is conducted. It is required, however, that certain studies shall be taught. There are ten required subjects. Physiology is one. It is required that those who labor as physicians shall be proficient in these studies. In starting our sanitariums for the care of the sick, we must secure a charter from the government; our printing office must do the same. Would the securing of a charter for a medical school, where our students might obtain an education, militate against our dependence upon God?",
