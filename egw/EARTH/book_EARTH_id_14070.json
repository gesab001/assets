    "word": "We as a people need to be sanctified unto God daily. From day to day, from hour to hour, from moment to moment, we need to know the will of God concerning us. Constantly we are to be on the watch over self. High responsibilities devolve upon every one who has covenanted to serve God and to fulfill all the obligations of this life. We are to cultivate the mind in a knowledge of spiritual things. The whole being--body, soul, spirit--is to be consecrated to God's service. As we do our part faithfully, shall not the Judge of all the earth do right by us? We are to be laborers together with God. \"Ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.\" Constantly we are to work in harmony with God.",
