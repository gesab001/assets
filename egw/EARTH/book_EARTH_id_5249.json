    "word": "To Lift Up Christ \n\n     The purpose of our health institutions is not first and foremost to be that of hospitals.

Christ is the one to be revealed in all the institutions connected with the closing work, but none of them can do it so fully as the health institution where the sick and suffering come for relief and deliverance from both physical and spiritual ailment.
