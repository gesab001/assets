    "word": "Professed Christians keep altogether too near the lowlands of earth. Their eyes are trained to see only commonplace things, and their minds dwell upon the things their eyes behold. Their religious experience is often shallow and unsatisfying, and their words are light and valueless. How can such reflect the image of Christ? How can they send forth the bright beams of the Sun of righteousness into all the dark places of the earth? To be a Christian is to be Christlike.--Review and Herald, Apr. 28, 1891.",
