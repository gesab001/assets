    "word": "THE POWER OF PRAYER BRINGS FRUIT TO OUR WORK FOR GOD.\u2014Those in the darkness of error are the purchase of the blood of Christ. They are the fruit of His suffering, and they are to be labored for. Let our canvassers know that it is for the advancement of Christ\u2019s kingdom that they are laboring. He will teach them as they go forth to their God-appointed work, to warn the world of a soon-coming judgment. Accompanied by the power of persuasion, the power of prayer, the power of the love of God, the evangelist\u2019s work will not, can not, be without fruit. Think of the interest that the Father and the Son have in this work. As the Father loves the Son, so the Son loves those that are His,\u2014those who work as He worked to saved perishing souls. None need feel that they are powerless: for Christ declares, \u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\u201d He has promised that He will give this power to His workers. His power is to become their power.\u2014(Colporteur Ministry, 108.)",
