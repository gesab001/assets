    "word": "God has a church in the world, and this church is nearer to His heart than anything else in this earth. He holds communication with His church. He gives individuals ability and talents, and imparts to them of His Spirit, that they may be the guardians of His church, to watch over the interests of His people. These are His stewards, and He has placed some of them in this school, to watch over the youth who may attend. Students, when you see that they have a kindly interest in you, respond to it for Christ's sake. Place yourselves on the right side. Be determined that you will not be found under the black banner of the prince of darkness, that you will fight under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel.",
