    "word": "There has been a war in the hearts of some, from the commencement of the introduction of health reform. They have felt the same rebellion as did the children of Israel when their appetites were restricted in their journeying from Egypt to Canaan. Professed followers of Christ, who have consulted their own pleasure, and their own interest, their own ease, their own appetites, all through their lives, are not prepared to change their course of action, and live for the glory of God, imitating the self-sacrificing life of their unerring Pattern. A holy and perfect example is given for Christians to follow and imitate. The words and works of Christ's followers are the channel through which the pure principles of truth and holiness are conveyed to the world. They are the salt of the earth, the light of the world.",
