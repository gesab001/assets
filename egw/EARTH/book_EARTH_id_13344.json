    "word": "I have been shown that our disappointment in 1844 was not because of failure in the reckoning of prophetic periods, but in the events to take place.

The Saviour did enter the Most Holy Place in 1844 to cleanse the sanctuary and the investigative judgment had commenced for the dead. I have been repeatedly urged to accept the different periods of time proclaimed for the Lord to come.",
