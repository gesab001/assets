    "word": "When you receive the words of Christ as if they were addressed to you personally, when each applies the truth to himself as if he were the only sinner on the face of the earth for whom Christ died, you will learn to claim by faith the merits of the blood of a crucified and risen Saviour in your own case. Your religious experience will have a different mould from what it now has. Pharisaism will not then exist; you will think it the highest honor to lift up Jesus before the people, saying, \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Your manner, your attitude, your voice, your language, your thoughts will represent Jesus, and then there will be a great change in your presentation of truth. The message you bear, the efforts you make in the work, do not now rightly present Christ. Jesus is not now lifted up by you as the supreme object of thought, as the One who can draw all men to Himself. We must teach those for whom we labor that they must hear, obey, and follow Christ. You need \n                                                                           401\nnot wait for a great occasion to do His work. You need not ask for great ability; all you need is to hide in Jesus, that your works may be wrought in God. If you do this, your work will not be merely mechanical, but it will have life and power; it will arouse and vivify. You will tell the story of Christ from a heart softened by His love.  With simple faith, as a little child tells its trials and sorrows to its mother, so the child of God will go to His heavenly Father, never doubting the reality of His love, to tell Him all his griefs and joys.",
