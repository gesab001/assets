    "word": "HEAVENLY KNOWLEDGE WILL BE PROGRESSIVE.\u2014All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God\u2019s redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless flight to worlds afar\u2014worlds that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle of human woe and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul. With unutterable delight the children of earth enter into the joy and the wisdom of unfallen beings. They share the treasures of knowledge and understanding gained through the ages upon ages in contemplation of God\u2019s handiwork. With undimmed vision they gaze upon the glory of creation\u2014suns and stars and systems, all in their appointed order circling the throne of Deity. Upon all things, from the least to the greatest, the Creator\u2019s name is written, and in all are the riches of His power displayed.\u2014GC 677, 678.",
