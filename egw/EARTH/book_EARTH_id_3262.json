    "word": "\u201cAs right religion received neither its origin nor its \n251\nauthority from princes, but from the eternal God alone, so are not subjects bound to frame their religion according to the tastes of their princes. For oft it is that princes, of all others, are the most ignorant of God's true religion. If all the seed of Abraham had been of the religion of Pharaoh, whose subjects they long were, I pray you, madam, what religion would there have been in the world? And if all in the days of the apostles had been of the religion  of the Roman emperors, I pray you, madam, what religion would there have been now upon the earth? . . . And so, madam, you may perceive that subjects are not bound to the religion of their princes, although they are commanded to give them reverence.\u201d",
