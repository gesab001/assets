    "word": "6. I have been aroused by the Spirit of the Lord to sound an alarm, that these world-bound souls may be awakened to the peril in which they are placed through their course of backsliding. For Christ's sake, let all those who profess to be Christians, depart from all iniquity, all dishonesty. For Christ's sake, for your own soul's sake, I urge you to reform. Let there be a solemn consideration of your privileges and responsibilities. Let there not be found among you a selfish, earthly ambition for place and position or money-getting. This spirit prevails to a large extent, and the religion of Christ is brought down to a low, common level. There is great need that the converting power of God may be felt throughout the office, that all may realize that the words of Christ are to be fulfilled in life and character. Every day Jesus is in that office taking note of every worker in every department and line of work. The voice of God speaks to all who are there employed, warning and reproving them in his Word, and through the testimonies of his Spirit. But these warnings are first neglected, then despised, then stubbornly resisted and assailed.",
