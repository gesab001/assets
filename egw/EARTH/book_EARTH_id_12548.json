    "word": "God has given his Word power, but at what a cost! What labor and pain, and anguish of soul have \n\n\n                              [19] \n\nbeen endured! What time and money have been bestowed! And how much of God's talents has been wasted under misconception in counterworking the work of God, at the very time the message was to go with a loud voice and ripen off the harvest of the earth! Men in high places of trust have gone from place to place as agents, working on the enemy's side. While the workers of God, sent forth with a special message, have prosecuted their work as men who must give an account, they have not been appreciated. Their way has been hedged up, and their labor counterworked as far as possible.",
