    "word": "\"Dear Brethren:\"- \n     During my stay in southern California I was enabled to visit places that in the past had been presented to me by the Lord as suitable for the establishment of sanitariums and schools. . . . I have been instructed that the work in southern California should have advantages that it has not yet enjoyed. \n\n\n                              -479- \n\nI have been shown that in southern California there were properties for sale on which buildings are already erected that could be utilized for our work, . . and that such properties will be offered to us at much less than their original cost. . . The work in southern California is to advance more rapidly than it has advanced in the past. The means lying in banks or hidden in the earth is now called for to strengthen the work in southern California. Every year many thousands of tourists visit southern California, and by various methods we should seek to reach them with the truth.",
