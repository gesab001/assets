    "word": "In the wilderness of temptation the destiny of the human race had been at stake. Christ was then conqueror. Now the tempter had come for the last fearful struggle. For this he had been preparing during the three years of Christ\u2019s ministry. Everything was at stake with him. If he failed here, his hope of mastery was lost; the kingdoms of the world would finally become Christ\u2019s; he himself would be overthrown and cast out.

With the issues of the conflict before Him, Christ\u2019s soul was filled with dread of separation from God. . . .",
