    "word": "The Jews had excited the envy and hatred of Herod against Christ, through their false interpretations \n                                                                           23\nof the prophets. They taught that Christ was to reign over an earthly empire, in unsurpassed glory. Their proud boasting presented the Saviour of the world and his mission to the earth altogether in a false light. Their lofty ideas and their proud boasting did not result as Satan had at first purposed they should, in the destruction of the infant Saviour, but rebounded back upon themselves, filling their homes with mourning. Jeremiah, in prophetic vision, says: \"In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.\" Herod did not long survive his cruel work. He died a fearful death, and was compelled to yield to a power he could not turn aside or overcome.",
