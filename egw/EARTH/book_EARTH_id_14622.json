    "word": "Jesus Christ was the True Witness. He declares He came from the Father. \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\" John 3:11-13. He said He came to reveal the Father. \n                                                                           886",
