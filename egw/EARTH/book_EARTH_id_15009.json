    "word": "A Blessed Work \n\n     My brethren and sisters, it takes time to give nurture and admonition. Tell them of the Father who loved them so that He gave His only Son for their salvation. Tell them the story of Christ's earthly life and His sacrifice in their behalf. This will touch their hearts. By such instruction they will see that you want them to be conformed to His likeness.",
