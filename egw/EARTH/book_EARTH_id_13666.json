    "word": "When Christ said to the sick of the palsy, \"Be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee,\" He gave His enemies a sign which they could not set aside. \"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?\" But Jesus, knowing their unspoken thoughts, said, \"What reason ye in your hearts? Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (He said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today\" [Luke 5:21-26].",
