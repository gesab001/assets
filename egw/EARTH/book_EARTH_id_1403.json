He addresses His commandment-keeping people in these last days, \"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\" \"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from freshly lusts, which war against the soul.\" 1 Peter 2:9, 11.",
