    "word": "MR No. 796 - The Church Not Perfect\n\n     The church upon the earth is not perfect. It is not the church that will be when Zion is triumphant. Earth is not heaven. The church is composed of erring men and women who will need patient, painstaking effort that they may be educated, trained, and disciplined by precept and example to do their work with acceptance and to be crowned with glory and immortality in the future life.--Letter 22, 1889, p. 7. (Written at Battle Creek, Michigan, January 16, 1889, to R. A. Underwood.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. July 16, 1980",
