    "word": "\"Again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them.\" Remember, there is a witness in every assembly, One who knows whether your thoughts are holy, kind, tender, and Christlike, or whether they are hard, unkind, and satanic. A record of your words and your spirit, and of the result of your course of action, goes up to heaven. You cannot afford to be careless and inattentive in this matter.",
