    "word": "You have a serious, solemn work to do to prepare the way of the Lord. You need the heavenly unction, and you may have it. \"Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.\" Who can be trifling, who can engage in frivolous, common talk, while by faith he sees the Lamb that was slain pleading before the Father as the intercessor of the church upon earth?",
