    "word": "Dwelling Upon Christ Provides Stimulus.--If we would permit our minds to dwell more upon Christ and the heavenly world, we should find a powerful stimulus and support in fighting the battles of the Lord.

Beside the loveliness of Christ all earthly attractions will seem of little worth.--RH, Nov 15, 1887.",
