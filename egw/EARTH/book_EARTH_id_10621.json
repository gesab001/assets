    "word": "\u201cYe are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?\u201d Read Revelation, read from the beginning to the close. Not only read, but study most earnestly, determined to understand. \u201cBlessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.\u201d Read chapter 2:1-5. There is to be a doing of the first work. \u201cNevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou has left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\u201d See also chapter 3:1-8.",
