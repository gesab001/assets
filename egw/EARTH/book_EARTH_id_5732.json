    "word": "As the living cloud comes still nearer, every eye beholds the Prince of life. No crown of thorns now mars that sacred head, but a diadem of glory rests on His holy brow. His countenance outshines the dazzling brightness of the noonday sun. \"And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.\" . . . The heavens are rolled together as a scroll, the earth trembles before Him, and every mountain and island is moved out of its place. . . .",
