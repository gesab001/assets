    "word": "God's servants should remember that in every assembly Christ is present. Angels are ascending and descending the heavenly ladder. A living connection has been made between earth and heaven, and God's glory shines upon the congregation. God requires the men who stand before the people as His mouthpieces to have clear discernment. He requires them to speak under the influence of His Spirit. There is no need for their brains to be beclouded by indigestion. They should guard the door of the lips, allowing nothing to enter that will make a disturbance.",
