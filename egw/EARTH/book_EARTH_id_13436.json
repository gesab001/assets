    "word": "The crowns of the saints were of the purest gold, and were decked with stars, and shone like the sun, as they moved all together to the top of the city. Their faces shone with glory, for they were in the express image of Jesus. Then the wicked saw what they had lost. And fire was breathed from God upon them and consumed them. Then was the execution of the judgment. The wicked received according as the saints, in unison with Jesus, had meted out to them through the 1,000 years. The same fire from God that consumed the wicked purified the whole earth. The mountains melted with fervent heat, the atmosphere also, and all the stubble was consumed. Then our inheritance opened before us glorious and beautiful. Then we inherited the whole earth made new. We shouted with a loud voice, Glory Alleluia.",
