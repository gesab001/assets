    "word": "The Improvement of Our Talents \n\n\n     In the parable of the talents the servant who had five talents traded upon them wisely, and in the day of reckoning was able to bring double that number to the Master. The one also who had two doubled his talents. But the man who had one talent hid it in a napkin and buried it in the earth. And when the master returned and reckoned with his servants, the sentence pronounced upon this unslothful servant was, \"Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents\" (Matthew 25:28).",
