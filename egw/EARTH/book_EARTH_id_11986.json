Dear Brethren and Sisters at --: \n     Let not the enemy of God and man control your thoughts, your words and actions. The message from the lips of Christ is, \"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not.\" There will be many great failures in earthly banks, and in speculations, including mining and real estate.",
