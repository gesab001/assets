    "word": "The God who gives mental capabilities, and who entrusts talents to the men and women who are His by creation and by redemption, expects that these talents and these capabilities will be increased by use. But when men glory in their capabilities and cause the praise of them to flow to finite beings, they dishonor God, and He will remove that in which they glory. When the physician is tempted to feel that he has methods which he can carry independent of the gospel of Christ, independent of the people for whom God has wrought that He might place them above every other people on the face of the earth, and he attempts to carry his plans, he will not meet with success. God establishes His instrumentalities among a people who recognize the laws of the divine government. The sick are to be healed through the combined efforts of the human and the divine. Every gift, every power, that Christ promised to His disciples, He bestows upon those who will serve Him faithfully.",
