    "word": "It is especially true that new and startling themes \n\n                            - 9 - \n\nshould not be presented to the people at too great length. In every address given, let there be an application of truth to the heart, that whosoever may hear shall understand, and that men, women, and youth may become alive unto God. Try to lead all, from the least to the greatest, to search the word; for the knowledge of His glory is to fill the whole earth as the waters cover the sea.",
