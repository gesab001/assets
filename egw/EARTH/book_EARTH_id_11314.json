    "word": "At the meeting on a mountain in Galilee, all the believers who could be called together were assembled. . . . At the time appointed, about five hundred believers were collected in little knots on the mountainside, eager to learn all that could be learned from those who had seen Christ since His resurrection. . . . Suddenly Jesus stood among them. No one could tell whence or how He came. . . . Now He declared that \u201call power\u201d was given to Him. His words carried the minds of His hearers above earthly and temporal things to the heavenly and eternal.\u2014DA 818, 819.",
