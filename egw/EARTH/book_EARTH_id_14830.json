The Lord has given me a message for Dr. Caro and Brother Sharp and for our ministers in this country. I was instructed that temptations would come to them which they did not suspect as temptations, and the import of which they did not discern. The message was given me that Dr. Kellogg would be displeased if the Medical Missionary work in this country were connected with the work of the Union Conference. But there is to be no separation in the different lines of missionary work done by Seventh-day Adventists. The different parts of the work are to combine to make a great whole. He who is the Strength of Israel has His army on earth. His soldiers are to stand united with the army of heaven in the work of giving truth to our world, in places nigh and regions afar off. His servants are to work in perfect harmony, those in a place which has been blessed with advantages supplying those in more destitute regions with facilities for the work.",
