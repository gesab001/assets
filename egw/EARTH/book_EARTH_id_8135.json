    "word": "Greater wonders than have yet been seen will be witnessed by those upon the earth a short period previous to the coming of Christ. \"And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.\" \"And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.\" \"And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.\"",
