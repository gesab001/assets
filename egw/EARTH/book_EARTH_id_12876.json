    "word": "Darkness covers the earth, and it is time for God's servants to \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins.\" Isaiah 58:1. Where is a voice of alarm to be heard? The Christian world needs to be aroused, that they may stand. The ladder must be climbed. Jacob saw that it reached from earth to heaven. When at Bethel, while fleeing from the wrong he had committed, as he was lying in his lonely condition, God had pity and compassion upon him and revealed Himself to him. There was presented before him the plan of salvation. Angels were seen ascending and descending from heaven, and Jacob was permitted to see the court of heaven, and there he saw that the light was permitted to shine from heaven to the inhabitants of the earth.",
