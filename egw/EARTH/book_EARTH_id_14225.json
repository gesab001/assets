    "word": "God's holy law comes sounding down along the line to our time. If the words of this law were hung up in prominent places, as are the pictures on our walls, would they not have a more powerful influence for good than do these pictures? The words of God's law could be printed on cards and hung up on the walls of your houses. The attention of some will be arrested as their eyes fall upon the ten commandments. Thus the Lord will impress hearts and minds. The law of the Lord is holy, just, and good, and perfect, and it is of the greatest importance that men and women read and understand this law, which is God's pledged word to all who dwell upon the earth.",
