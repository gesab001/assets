    "word": "In these days, persecution and reproach for Christ's sake, are scarcely known. But very little self-denial and sacrifice is necessary in order to put on a form of godliness, and have the name upon a church book. But to live in such a manner that our ways will be pleasing to God, and our names registered in the book of life, will require watchfulness and prayer, self-denial and sacrifice on our part. Professed Christians should be no example for the youth, only as far as they follow Christ. Right actions are unmistakable fruits of true godliness. The Judge of all the earth will give every one according as his works shall be. Children who follow Christ, have a warfare before them. They have a daily cross to bear in coming out from the world and being separate, and imitating the life of Christ. \n                                                                           148",
