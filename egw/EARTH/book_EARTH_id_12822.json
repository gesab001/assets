    "word": "\"I do set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth . . . And I will remember My covenant, . . . and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh\" [Genesis 9:13-15]. In the rainbow above the throne is an everlasting testimony that \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" [John 3:16]. Whenever the law is presented before the people, let the teacher of truth point out the throne arched with the rainbow of promise, the righteousness of Christ. The glory of the law is Christ. He came to magnify the law and make it honorable. Make it distinct that mercy and truth have met together in Christ, and righteousness and peace have embraced each other. It is when you are looking to His throne, offering up your penitence and praise and thanksgiving to God, that you perfect Christian character, and represent Christ to the world. You abide in Christ and Christ abides in you; you have that peace that passeth all understanding. We need constantly to meditate upon Christ and His attractive loveliness. We must direct minds to Jesus, fasten them upon Him. In every discourse dwell upon the divine attributes.",
