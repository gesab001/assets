    "word": "Those who live during the last days of this earth's history will know what it means to be persecuted for the truth's sake. In the courts injustice will prevail. The judges will refuse to listen to the reasons of those who are loyal to the commandments of God, because they know that arguments in favor of the fourth commandment are unanswerable. They will say, \"We have a law, and by our law he ought to die.\" God's law is nothing to them. \"Our law\" with them is supreme. Those who respect this human law will be favored, but those who will not bow to the idol sabbath will have no favors shown them.",
