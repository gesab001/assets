    "word": "Love is the principle that underlies God's government in heaven and on earth, and this love must be interwoven in the life of the Christian. The love of Christ is not a fitful love; it is deep, and broad, and full. Its possessor will not say, \"I will love only those who love me.\" The heart that is influenced by this holy principle will be carried above everything of a selfish nature.",
