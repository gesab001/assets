    "word": "Danger from Worldly Books. \n\n     14. I have a word from the Lord for you who are handling sacred things, and yet who do not appreciate the value of eternal things, and have not spiritual discernment to understand the work that you are doing. The Spirit of God is grieved because works of a worldly character, which are calculated to charm the senses, to fill the mind with that which can be compared only to wood, hay, and stubble, are multiplied in the office of publication. These books are read with eagerness, and they contain no spiritual nutriment, whereby the soul can acquire moral strength, give no true idea of Christian life, or instruction in regard to the common duties of life. The atmosphere they breathe is one that is detrimental to solid Christian experience. Were Christ upon the earth today, he \n                                                                           35\nwould cleanse the office of many things that are not in accordance with our high profession, as he cleansed the temple of its unholy traffic. \"It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\" Let every soul begin to cleanse his own soul temple, and thus cooperate with Christ in the work of purifying the office.",
