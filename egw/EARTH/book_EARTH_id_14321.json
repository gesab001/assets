    "word": "Our expectation is from God who in the crucified One, has given us rich and powerful truths and weighty arguments to move the hearts of men. The simple prayer indited by the Holy Spirit will ascend through the gates ajar, the open door [of] which Christ has declared, \"I have opened, and no man can shut\" [cf. Revelation 3:7]. Those prayers, mingled with the incense of the perfections of Christ, will ascend as fragrance before the Father, and answers will come. The Holy Spirit will descend, and souls will come to a knowledge of the truth. Sinners will be converted, and their faces turned from the world and earthly things toward heaven. The Sun of righteousness will inspire them with motives for action, and they will realize that they are witnesses for Christ.",
