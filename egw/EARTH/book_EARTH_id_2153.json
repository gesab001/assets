    "word": "In like manner I saw that Jesus regarded with the deepest compassion the disappointed ones who had waited for His coming; and He sent His angels to direct their minds that they might follow Him where He was.

The disappointment of the first disciples well represents the disappointment of those who expected their Lord in 1844.",
