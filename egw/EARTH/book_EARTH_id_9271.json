    "word": "The Pipe Versus Heaven.--I have seen many an example of the power of these habits. One woman I knew who was advised by her physician to smoke as a remedy for the asthma. To all appearance she had been a zealous Christian for many years, but she became so addicted to smoking that when urged to give it up as an unhealthful and defiling habit, she utterly refused to do so. She said, \"When the matter comes before my mind distinctly, that I must give up my pipe or lose heaven, then I say, 'Farewell heaven;' I cannot surrender my pipe.\" This woman only put into words that which many express by their actions. God, the maker of heaven and earth, He who created man and claims the whole heart, the entire affections, is held subordinate to the disgusting, defiling nuisance, tobacco.--Letter 8, 1893.",
