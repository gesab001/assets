    "word": "God was dishonored by the plans devised for issuing bonds as a means of obtaining money with which to complete the Battle Creek Sanitarium building; for the talent of means in the hands of our people is thus tied up where it can not be used for the proclamation of the third angel's message in fields still unentered. There is a world to be warned; and God's people must be cautioned against becoming so impoverished financially by tying up their means in great institutions that they will have little or nothing left with which to provide facilities in needy fields and with which to carry forward the Lord's work in all parts of the earth.",
