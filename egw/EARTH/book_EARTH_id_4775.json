    "word": "It is the love of Christ that makes our heaven. But when we seek to tell of this love, language fails us. We think of His life on earth, of His sacrifice for us; we think of His work in heaven as our advocate, of the mansions He is preparing for those who love Him; and we can but exclaim, \"O the heights and depths of the love of Christ!\" As we linger beneath the cross, we gain a faint conception of the love of God, and we say, \"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\" But in our contemplation of Christ, we are only lingering round the edge of a love that is measureless. His love is like a vast ocean, without bottom or shore.",
