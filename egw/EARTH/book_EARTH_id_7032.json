    "word": "There had been a time in Peter's experience when he was unwilling to see the cross in the work of Christ. When the Saviour made known to the disciples His impending sufferings and death, Peter exclaimed, \"Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee\" (Matthew 16:22). Self-pity, which shrank from fellowship with Christ in suffering prompted Peter's remonstrance. It was to the disciple a bitter lesson, and one which he learned but slowly, that the path of Christ on earth lay through agony and humiliation. But in the heat of the furnace fire he was to learn its lesson. Now, when his once-active form was bowed with the burden of years and labors, he could write, \"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you. . . . But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings.\"--The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 524, 525.",
