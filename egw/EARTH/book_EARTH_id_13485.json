    "word": "Christ's commission to His first disciples is the great missionary charter of the gospel. If His followers would fulfill their mission, they would have the reward of His approval. To them would be spoken the words, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant, . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\" [Matthew 25:21]. And this commission His followers today are ever to hold sacred, and to work out in their experience. In following Christ's example and in bringing into their life practice the principles that He laid down for the work of the first disciples, they, like them, are to make His name a praise in the earth.",
