    "word": "THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH SEEM TO BE GIVING WAY.\u2014There is a mighty earthquake. The firmament appears to open and shut. The glory from the throne of God seems flashing through. The mountains shake like a reed in the wind, and ragged rocks are scattered on every side. There is a roar as of a coming tempest. The sea is lashed into fury. There is heard the shriek of the hurricane, like the voice of demons upon a mission of destruction. The whole earth heaves and swells like the waves of the sea. Its surface is breaking up. Its very foundations seem to be giving way. Mountain chains are sinking. Inhabited islands disappear with their living freight. The seaports that have become like Sodom for wickedness are swallowed up by the angry waters. Great hailstones, every one \u201cabout the weight of a talent,\u201d [Revelation 16:21] are doing their work of destruction. The proudest cities of the earth are laid low. The costly palaces, upon which \n28\nthe world\u2019s great men have lavished their wealth in order to glorify themselves, are crumbling to ruin before their eyes.\u20144SP 453, 454.",
