    "word": "Read the 21st chapter of Luke. In it Christ gives the warning, \"Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may \n\n\n                                     -229- \n\nbe accounted worthy to escape all these things, and to stand before the Son of man\" (Luke 21:34-36).",
