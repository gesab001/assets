    "word": "To the disciples this commandment was new; for they had not loved one another as Christ had loved them. He saw that new ideas and impulses must control them, that new principles must be practiced by them; through His life and death they were to receive a new conception of love. The \n\n\n                                      -282- \n\ncommand to love one another had a new meaning in the light of his sacrifice. During every hour of Christ's sojourn on earth, the love of God was flowing from him in irrepressible streams. All who are imbued with his spirit will love as he loved. The very principles that actuated Christ will actuate them in all their dealings with one another.",
