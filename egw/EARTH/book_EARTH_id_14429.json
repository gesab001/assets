    "word": "The path of disobedience leads to eternal death. The path of obedience leads to eternal life. \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\" When the redeemed from all the nations of the earth enter their heavenly home, they will have free access to the tree of life. No angel with flaming sword will stand guard, as it was necessary for an angel to do after Adam and Eve sinned.",
