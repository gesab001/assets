Here the chilly winds of affliction blow upon us, and the waves of trouble roll against us. But in the near future, when Christ comes, sorrow and sighing will be forever ended. Then will be the Christian\u2019s summer. All trials will be over, and there will be no more sickness or death. \u201cGod shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying . . . : for the former things are passed away.\u201dMs 28, 1886 quoted in 7BC 988.",
