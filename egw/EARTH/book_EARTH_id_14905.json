    "word": "The God of power and glory, the Strength of Israel, is being put out of sight by man's glorification of human capabilities. A change must be brought about. There is no need of so much of man's devising. We are nearing the close of this earth's history. God says I will overturn, overturn, until man stands in his appointed place. I am the true Shepherd of My flock. The voice and judgment of man is not to be the voice (390) and judgment of My people. Church members are to be educated, line upon line, and precept upon precept, to look to God for wisdom and counsel.",
