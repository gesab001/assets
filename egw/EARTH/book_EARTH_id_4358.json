    "word": "Angels are hastening to and fro in heaven. An angel returning from the earth announces that his work is done; the final test has been brought upon the world, and all who have proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have received \"the seal of the living God.\" Then Jesus ceases His intercession in the sanctuary above. . . . Christ has made the atonement for His people, and blotted out their sins. The number of His subjects is made up; \"the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven,\" is about to be given to the heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to reign as King of kings, and Lord of lords.--GC 613, 614 (1911).",
