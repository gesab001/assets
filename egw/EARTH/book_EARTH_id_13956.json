    "word": "The wicked rulers, the apostate churches, have been converted to the world, and they show just exactly what they would do in this age of the world if they dared. If Christ were on the earth today, they would have no more desire for Him than had the Jewish nation at His first advent. They would do as did the Jews. Were it in their power, they would crucify Christ because He tells them the truth. They are educating up to this point. Rulers and teachers who have caused souls to stumble over their perverted teachings, statesmen, senators, governors, all people who might have understood the prophecies, but who did not read and search to see if they were applicable for this time and concerned their individual selves, will be taken in the snare. They will reap eternal loss. They will suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.",
