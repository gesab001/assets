    "word": "How beautiful the earth was when it came from the Creator's hand. God presented before the universe a world in which even His all-seeing eye could find no spot or stain, no defect or crookedness. Each part of His creation occupied the place assigned to it, and answered the purpose for which it was created. Like the parts of some great machine, part fitted to part, and all was in perfect harmony. Peace and holy joy filled the earth. There was no confusion, no clashing. There was no disease to afflict man or beast, and the vegetable kingdom was without taint of corruption. God looked upon the work \n\n\n                                     -31- \n\nof His hands, wrought out by Christ, and pronounced it very good. He looked upon a perfect world, in which there was no trace of sin, no imperfection. --Letter 29, 1903, p. 2. (To the Members of the Churches in Australia and New Zealand, January 25, 1903.)",
