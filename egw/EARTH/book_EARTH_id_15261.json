    "word": "The Lord demands uprightness in the smallest as well as the largest matters. Those who are accepted at last as members of the heavenly court, will be men and women who here on earth have sought to carry out the Lord's will in every particular, who had sought to put the impress of heaven upon their earthly labors. In order that the earthly tabernacle might represent the heavenly, it must be perfect in all its parts, and it must be in the smallest detail like the pattern in the heavens. So it is with the characters of those who are finally accepted in the sight of heaven.",
