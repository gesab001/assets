    "word": "The kingdom of heaven is likened to treasure hid in a field, \"the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\" He buys it that he may work it, plow up every part of it, and take possession of its treasures. It is the Holy Spirit's office to direct this search and to reward it. The searcher, while digging the field, finds leads of precious ore of which he seeks to estimate the value, and he sinks the shaft deeper, for still more valuable treasure. Thus many a rich lode is discovered. The gold fields of the earth are not so interlaced with veins of precious ore as is the field of revelation with leads that bring to view the unsearchable riches of Christ.",
