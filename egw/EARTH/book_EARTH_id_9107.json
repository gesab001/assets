    "word": "Noah's Sacrifice and God's Promise\n \n\n     Noah did not forget God, who had so graciously preserved them, but immediately erected an altar and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar, showing his faith in Christ the great sacrifice, and manifesting his gratitude to God for their wonderful preservation. The offering of Noah came up before God like a sweet savor. He accepted the offering and blessed Noah and his family. Here a lesson is taught all who should\n70\nlive upon the earth, that for every manifestation of God's mercy and love toward them the first act of all should be to render to Him grateful thanks and humble worship.",
