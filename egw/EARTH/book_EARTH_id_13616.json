    "word": "But there are mercies mixed with judgment. Revelation 7:3, 4. The Lord has a people whom He will preserve. John beheld the \"four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree\" (Revelation 7:1, 3) till the seal of the living God shall be placed upon those who love God and keep His commandments. The elements of nature are to be placed in the power of angels of God. He holdeth the winds in His fists; He gathereth the waters in the hollow of His hand; He maketh the clouds His chariot; \"The Lord sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth King forever\" (Proverbs 30:4; Isaiah 40:12; Psalms 104:3; 29:10).",
