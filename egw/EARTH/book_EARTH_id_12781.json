    "word": "The prophecies in the eighteenth of Revelation will soon be fulfilled. During the proclamation of the third angel's message, \"another angel\" is to \"come down from heaven, having great power\" and the earth is to be \"lightened with His glory.\" The Spirit of the Lord will so graciously and universally bless consecrated human instrumentalities, that men, women, and children will open their lips in praise and testimony, filling the earth with the knowledge of God and with His unsurpassed glory, as the waters cover the sea.",
