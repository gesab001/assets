    "word": "When god spoke His law with an audible voice from Sinai, He introduced the Sabbath by saying, \u201cRemember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\u201d He then declares definitely what shall be done on the six days, and what shall not be done on the seventh. He next gives the reason for thus observing the week, by pointing us back to His example on the first seven days of time. \u201cFor in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\u201d This reason appears beautiful and forcible when we understand the record of Creation to mean literal days.",
