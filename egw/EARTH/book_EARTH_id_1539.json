    "word": "The Power of Earth Broken \n\n     Christ came to give to men the wealth of eternity, and this wealth, through connection with Him, we are to receive and impart. Not to ministers only, but to every believer, Christ says, The world is enshrouded in darkness. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. Everyone who truly loves God will be a light in the world.",
