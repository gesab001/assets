    "word": "Chapter 4 \n\n     30 (Luke 13:18). Not Like Earthly Governments.--The government of the kingdom of Christ is like no earthly government. It is a representation of the characters of those who compose the kingdom. \"Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God?\" Christ asked, \"or with what comparison shall we compare it?\" He could find nothing on earth that would serve as a perfect comparison. His court is one where holy love presides, and whose offices and appointments are graced by the exercise of charity. He charges His servants to bring pity and loving-kindness, His own attributes, into all their office work, and to find their happiness and satisfaction in reflecting the love and tender compassion of the divine nature on all with whom they associate (RH March 19, 1908).",
