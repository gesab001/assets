It seems to me, as I look upon the towering mountains that surround your valleys, that if I lived in this place, I would mark the spot where so many suffered in ages past for \n233\nthe truth, and taking courage from them, would lift the cross and obey the truth at any cost. As I think of those who have yielded their lives rather than the truth, it is plain to me what God has revealed concerning his people: \u201cThey shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.",
