    "word": "Satan has declared to His synagogue that man could not keep God's commandments. One soul saved would prove this statement false. One soul saved would demonstrate the righteousness of God's law. Christ came to this earth and by a life of obedience showed that man could obey. He canceled the guilt resting on the sinner. That the sinner might stand before God clothed with the robe of righteousness, Jesus clothed Himself with the robe of sorrow.",
