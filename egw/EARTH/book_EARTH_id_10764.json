    "word": "Every hour of the day we should realize that the Lord is near, that He sees all we do, and hears every word we utter. . . . Cheap, earthly, unchristian words may be represented as \"strange fire,\" and with this God can have nothing to do. The loud, boisterous laugh is a denial of God in the soul, for it reveals that the truth is not ruling in the heart. . . . By our vain words and unchristian example we dishonor God, and imperil not only our own souls but also the souls of those with whom we associate.",
