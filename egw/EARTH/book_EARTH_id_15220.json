    "word": "Although some mistakes have been made, the light given me is that instead of criticising and condemning, all should learn how to avoid such mistakes in the future. Who makes as his own the message of truth for this time. The Prince of Life offered Himself, a willing sacrifice, to save sinners living in the Southern states, as well as to save sinners living in remote parts of the earth. Workers must be called to this field as well as to distant lands. And the very least that these new laborers can say of the mistakes made, the better it will be for their own souls and for the future prosperity of the work. God views matters correctly. The infinite One alone is wise enough to pronounce correct judgment upon the work done. The Lord Jesus calls for workers, and he is the only Agency who can work through human minds and hands for the full development of the interests of his cause in this field.",
