    "word": "I want to tell you, dear friends, just now prior to the second appearing of Christ, you mingle with the earth, you mingle with the world; your business, your cares, your perplexities crowd upon you; the earthly becomes supreme, the heavenly subordinated to the earthly. Thus it was with the disciples. In order for them to understand the words of God and the Scriptures, there must be an application of the truth, a special divine enlightenment which they had not hitherto had; and He tells them that when the Holy Ghost shall come, the Comforter, He should bring all things that Christ had said unto them to their remembrance, and there would be an opening of their understanding.",
