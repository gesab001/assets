    "word": "Maintaining a High Moral Standard \n\n     Abandonment of Principle Marks the Times.-- Everywhere are seen wrecks of humanity, broken-down family altars, ruined homes. There is a strange abandonment of principle, the standard of morality is lowered, and the earth is fast becoming a Sodom. The practices which brought the judgment of God upon the antediluvian world, and which caused Sodom to be destroyed by fire, are fast increasing. We are nearing the end, when the earth is to be purified by fire. --Gospel Workers, pp. 125, 126. (1915)",
