    "word": "Nimes, Sunday, October 17, 1886. We walked out. The stores were most of them open, as on any other day, the market just as active as on any day of the week. The noisy clamor, the exchange of produce, the buying and selling, were like the Temple courts in the days of Christ--as if Sunday to them had no sacredness. We visited a building called the square house. There was a large portico or piazza sustained by many pillars. Within were relics and \n\n\n                                     -62- \n\nancient inscriptions upon them. This building was erected before Christ, built by Augustus Caesar for his sons. It is very ancient in appearance. It was covered up with rubbish in the destruction of buildings in Nimes, but was unearthed and stands just where it stood before Christ.",
