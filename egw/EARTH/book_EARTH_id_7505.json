    "word": "(Ezekiel 31:7.) The Christian a Sturdy Cedar.--When the love of Jesus is abiding in the soul, many who are now but withered branches will become as the cedars of Lebanon, \"whose root is by the great waters.\" The cedar is noted for the firmness of its roots. Not content to cling to the earth with a few weak fibers, it thrusts its rootlets, like a sturdy wedge, into the cloven rock, and reaches down deeper and deeper for strong holds to grasp. When the tempest grapples with its boughs, that firm-set tree cannot be uprooted. What a goodly cedar might not every follower of Christ become, if he were but rooted and grounded in the truth, firmly united to the Eternal Rock (RH June 20, 1882).",
