Here He repeats the servant's words, not acknowledging their truth, but showing what, even according to his own account, the servant ought to have done. The Lord virtually says: \"You made no effort to trade upon My entrusted capital, and to gain an increase to promote My glory in the earth. \"Thou oughtest . . . to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall \n                                                                           134\nhave abundance: but from him that hath not [traded on his Lord's goods] shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness\" (Matthew 25:27-30). To every soul to whom the light of truth has come is this lesson given.",
