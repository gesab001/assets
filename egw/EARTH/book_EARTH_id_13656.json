    "word": "Every Converted Soul to \"Preach.\" To every converted soul He says, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" It is not necessary that the Lord should first sit in earthly legislative councils and inquire of those who think they must plan for His work, \"Will you permit men whom I have chosen to unite with you in working in some part of My moral vineyard?\" Christ was standing only a few steps from His heavenly throne when He gave His commission to His disciples, and included as missionaries all who should believe in His name. Jesus wants every minister to whom He has committed a sacred trust to remember His injunctions, to consider the vastness of His work, and to place the obligation of preaching the gospel to the world upon the large number to whom it belongs.",
