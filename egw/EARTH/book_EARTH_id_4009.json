    "word": "God brought his people Israel from Egypt that they might keep his Sabbath, and he gave them special directions how to keep it. The ten precepts spoken by his own voice from Sinai, and the instructions given to Moses, were recorded for the benefit of all who should live upon the earth, to the close of time. God has given man six days for labor, but he has reserved the seventh to himself, and he has pronounced a blessing upon those who keep it holy. The day before the Sabbath is to be made a day of preparation, that everything may be in readiness for its sacred hours. \u201cBake that which ye will bake today, and seethe that ye will seethe.\u201d \u201cTomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord.\u201d Divine mercy has directed that the sick and suffering should be cared for; the labor required to make them comfortable is a work of necessity, and no violation of the Sabbath. But all unnecessary work should be avoided. Many carelessly put off till the beginning of the Sabbath little things that should have been done on the day of preparation. This should not be. Any work that is neglected until the commencement \n218\nof holy time should remain undone until the Sabbath is past.",
