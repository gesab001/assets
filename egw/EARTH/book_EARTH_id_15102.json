    "word": "A man lives unto God when he continually recognizes Him as a present Helper. When there is a recognition of the Lord Jesus Christ, there will be a holy fear lest he shall make mistakes. The soul will be drawn out continually in earnest prayer as he realizes his need. As he draws night unto God, God will draw night unto him, the love of God will be kindled in his heart, and he will be able to speak the words of God. The language of the heart will then be, \"Whom have I in heaven but Thee, and who on earth do I desire besides Thee?\" \n                                                                           275",
