    "word": "Importance of healthful diet\n     God has given us the fruits and grains of the earth for food, that \n19\nwe might have unfevered blood, calm nerves, and clear minds. The stimulating diet and drink of this day are not conducive to the best state of health. Tea, coffee, and tobacco are all stimulating, and contain poisons. They are not only unnecessary, but harmful, and should be discarded if we would add to knowledge, temperance. We should live by \u201cevery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u201d It is for us to \u201csearch the scriptures,\u201d and bring our habits into harmony with the instruction of the Bible. We are admonished, \u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\u201d",
