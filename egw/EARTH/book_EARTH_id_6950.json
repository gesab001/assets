    "word": "Christ has taught us to pray, \"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\" This opens before us the height to which we are to attain by steady progress and continual advancement. As members of the church of Christ, we are to do His will on earth. If all would do unto others as they would have others do unto them, we would see indications of a converted world. Upon this principle the Christian is to build. We are to ascend a ladder whose top reaches to heaven.",
