    "word": "Families and institutions should learn to do more in the cultivation and improvement of land. If people only knew the value of the products of the ground, which the earth brings forth in their season, more diligent efforts would be made to cultivate the soil. All should be acquainted with the special value of fruit and vegetables fresh from the orchard and garden. As the number of patients and students increase, more land will be needed. Grape vines should be planted, thus making it possible for the institution to produce its grapes. The orange orchard that is on the place would be an advantage.",
