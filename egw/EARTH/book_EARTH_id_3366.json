    "word": "The claim that Christ by his death abolished his Father's law, is without foundation. Had it been possible for the law to be changed or set aside, then Christ need not have died to save man from the penalty of sin. The death of Christ, so far from abolishing the law, proves that it is immutable. The Son of God came to \u201cmagnify the law, and make it honorable.\u201d [Isaiah 42:21.] He said, \u201cThink not that I am come to destroy the law;\u201d \u201ctill heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in nowise pass from the law.\u201d [Matthew 5:17, 18.] And concerning himself he declares, \u201cI delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.\u201d [Psalm 40:8.]",
