    "word": "Every worker who follows the example of Christ will be prepared to receive and use the power that God has promised to His church for the ripening of earth\u2019s harvest. Morning by morning, as the heralds of the gospel kneel before the Lord and renew their vows of consecration to Him, He will grant them the presence of His Spirit, with its reviving, sanctifying power. As they go forth to the day\u2019s duties, they have the assurance that the unseen agency of the Holy Spirit enables them to be \u201claborers together with God.\u201d [1 Corinthians 3:9.]\u2014(Gospel Workers, 510, 511.)",
