    "word": "\"'Many of the books piled up in the great libraries of earth, confuse the mind more than they aid the understanding. Yet men spend large sums of money in the purchase of such books, and years in their study, when they have within their reach a book containing the Words of Him who is the Alpha and Omega of wisdom. The time spent in a study of these books might better be spent in gaining a knowledge of Him Whom to know aright is life eternal. Those only who gain this knowledge will at last hear the words, \"Ye are complete in Him.\"",
