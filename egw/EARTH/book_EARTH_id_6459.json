    "word": "THE COMFORTER COMES IN ANSWER TO THE PRAYER OF FAITH.\u2014At all times and in all places, in all sorrows and in all afflictions, when the outlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we feel helpless and alone, the Comforter will be sent in answer to the prayer of faith. Circumstances may separate us from every earthly friend; but no circumstance, no distance, can separate us from the heavenly Comforter. Wherever we are, wherever we may go, He is always at our right hand to support, sustain, uphold, and cheer.\u2014(The Desire of Ages, 669, 670.)",
