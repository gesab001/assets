    "word": "The original apostasy began in disbelief and denial of the truth; but if we would triumph, we must fix the eye of faith steadfastly upon Jesus, the Captain of our salvation. We are to follow the example of Christ, and in all that Jesus did on earth. He had an eye single to the glory of God. He says, \"As the Father gave Me commandment, even so do I.\" Divinity and humanity were united in Christ, that He might reveal to us God's purpose, and bring man into close union with Himself. This union will enable us to overcome the enemy; for through faith in Christ we shall have divine power.",
