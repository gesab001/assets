    "word": "SOME HAVE INFERRED THAT THE EARTHLY SANCTUARY WAS A SYMBOL OF THE CHURCH, REASONING FROM THOSE SCRIPTURES IN WHICH THE CHURCH IS CALLED THE TEMPLE OF GOD. BUT IT IS NOT INFREQUENTLY THE CASE IN SCRIPTURE THAT IN DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS THE SAME FIGURE IS EMPLOYED TO REPRESENT DIFFERENT OBJECTS. THE BIBLE PLAINLY TEACHES THAT THE HOLY PLACES OF THE EARTHLY SANCTUARY WERE \u201cPATTERNS OF THINGS IN THE HEAVENS.\u201d HEBREWS 9:23. THE EXPRESSION, \u201cTEMPLE OF GOD,\u201d IS SOMETIMES EMPLOYED TO DESIGNATE THE SANCTUARY IN HEAVEN, AND SOMETIMES THE CHURCH. ITS SIGNIFICANCE, IN EACH CASE, MUST BE DETERMINED BY THE CONTEXT.",
