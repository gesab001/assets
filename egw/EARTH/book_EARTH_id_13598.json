    "word": "This day a telegram came responding that Brother McCoy's wife [Eliza] and daughter Ella May McCoy were dead; also Brother Young, elder of the church, the father of Brother McCoy's wife. Here are three cut right out of the family. We cannot be surprised at the great grief of our afflicted brother. He seems bowed to the very earth with his great sorrow. We feel like weeping with him but direct him to Jesus.--Manuscript 89, 1893, pp. 5, 6. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. September 5, 1985",
