    "word": "Those with whom God has entrusted His truth must so order their intercourse with the world as to secure to themselves a calm, hallowed peace, as well as a sacred and most thorough knowledge of how to meet men with their prejudices, where they are, and minister to them light, comfort, and peace found in the acceptance of the truth of God. They should take for [their] example the inspiring, authoritative, and social life of Christ. They must cultivate the same beneficent spirit which He possessed, and must cherish the same broad plans of action in meeting men where they are. They should have a kind, generous spirit toward the poor, and in a special sense feel that we are God's stewards. They must hold all they have as not their own but lent them in trust to advance the cause of Christ upon the earth. Like Christ, they should not shun the society of their fellow men, but encourage it, with the purpose of bestowing upon others the heavenly benefits God has given them. \n\n\n                                   -321-",
