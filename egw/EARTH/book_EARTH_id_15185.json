    "word": "We all need to sow a crop of patience, compassion, and love. We shall reap the harvest we are sowing, Our characters are now being formed for eternity. Here on earth we are being trained for heaven. We owe everything to grace., free grace, sovereign grace. Grace in the covenant ordained our adoption as sons of God. Grace in the Saviour effected our redemption, our regeneration, and our adoption to heirship with Jesus Christ. Let this grace be revealed to others.",
