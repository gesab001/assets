    "word": "God Wants His People to Be Ready to Meet Him in Peace--God is deferring the bringing of His judgment upon the earth in order that those who are supposed to be His people, but who have been bringing in the very things He has condemned in ancient Israel, working according to methods He will not accept, may get ready to meet Him in peace. Those who have been devising and bringing in selfish, covetous principles, and taking credit to themselves for their sharpness, will never see the kingdom of God unless they are decidedly changed in character; for selfishness is an abomination in the sight of the Lord, and is a dishonor to Christ, their Creator and Redeemer, whose name they claim. God says, \"I will thoroughly purge My floor of all chaff. I will sift My people as in a sieve. Those who name My name must be thoroughly cleansed from all false and corrupting principles. Those whom I claim as My heritage will even now be wondered at as a peculiar people, cleansed from all fraud, all injustice. Those who enter the city of God will here have worked righteousness revealing to the world the principles of heaven.\"--Ms. 15, 1901, pp. 3-4. (Diary, Feb. 21, 1901.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D.
