    "word": "Chap. 59 - The Bible in Education\n\n\n\"The words of Jehovah are pure\nwords; as silver tried in a\nfurnace on the earth, purified seven\ntimes.\"\n\nGod's Word a Treasure House\n\n     The Bible is of the highest value because it is the word of the living God. Of all the books in the world it is the most deserving of study and attention, for it is eternal wisdom. The Bible is a history that tells us of the creation of the world and opens to us past centuries. Without it we should have been left to conjecture and fable in regard to the occurrences of the remote past. It reveals to us the Creator of the heavens and the earth, with the universe that He has brought into being, and it sheds a glorious light over the world to come.",
