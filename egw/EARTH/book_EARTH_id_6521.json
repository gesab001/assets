    "word": "Especially should we, with unwavering faith, seek God for grace and power to be given to His people now. We do not believe that the time has fully come when He would have our liberties restricted. \n275\nThe prophet saw \u201cfour angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.\u201d Another angel, ascending from the east, cried to them, saying: \u201cHurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.\u201d This points out the work we have now to do. A vast responsibility is devolving upon men and women of prayer throughout the land to petition that God will sweep back the cloud of evil and give a few more years of grace in which to work for the Master. Let us cry to God that the angels may hold the four winds until missionaries shall be sent to all parts of the world and shall proclaim the warning against disobeying the law of Jehovah.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, 717, 718.)",
