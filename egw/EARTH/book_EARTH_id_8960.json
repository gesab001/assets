    "word": "A large company of evil angels were very busy. Satan was in their midst, and all looked with the most exulting satisfaction upon the company struggling for the crown. Satan seemed to throw a peculiar charm upon those who eagerly sought it. Many who sought this earthly crown were professed Christians. Some of them seemed to have a little light. They would look wishfully upon the heavenly crown, and often seemed charmed with its beauty, yet could obtain no true sense of its value and glory. While one hand was reaching forth languidly for the heavenly the other was reached eagerly for the earthly, determined to possess that, and in their earnest pursuit for the earthly, they lost sight of the heavenly. They were left in darkness, yet they were anxiously groping about to secure the earthly crown. Some became disgusted with the company who sought it so eagerly, and they seemed to have a sense of their danger, and turned from it, and earnestly sought for the heavenly crown. The countenances of such soon changed from dark to light, from gloom to cheerfulness and holy joy.",
