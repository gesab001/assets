    "word": "As Jesus stood among men clothed with the garb of humanity, He longed to unfold to His disciples the deep mysteries of the plan of redemption. But with sadness He was forced to say, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" The temporal, the earthly, was so mingled in their minds with the spiritual and the eternal that the sacred and heavenly were eclipsed. Eternal realities did not stand out before them in clear lines, and the precious lessons Christ desired to give them must be withheld because they would not be able to comprehend them.",
