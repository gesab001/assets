    "word": "Let the workers remember always that they are dependent on God. Let them not trust in human wisdom, but in the wisdom of the One who declares, \"All power is given unto Me in (91) heaven and in earth. . . Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Let them go forth two and two, depending upon God, not on man, for wisdom and success. Let them search the Scriptures, and then present the truths of God's Word to others. Let them be guided by the principles that Christ has laid down.",
