    "word": "\"He doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do\" (Revelation 13:13, 14). No mere impostures are here foretold. Men are deceived by the miracles which Satan's agents have power to do, not which they pretend to do.--GC 553 (1911).",
