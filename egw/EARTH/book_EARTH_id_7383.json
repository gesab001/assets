    "word": "An Early View of Sabbath Importance [SEE \n      ALSO EARLY WRITINGS, PP. 32-34, FOR THE \n    VISION IN 1847 ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SABBATH.] \n\n\n     I saw that we sensed and realized but little of the importance of the Sabbath, to what we yet should realize and know of its importance and glory. I saw we knew not what it was yet to ride upon the high places of the earth and to be fed with the heritage of Jacob. But when the refreshing and latter rain shall come from the presence of the Lord and the glory of His power, we shall know what it is to be fed with the heritage of Jacob and ride upon the high places of the earth. Then shall we see the Sabbath more in its importance and glory.",
