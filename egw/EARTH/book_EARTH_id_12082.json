    "word": "Time is precious. The destiny of souls is in the balance. At infinite cost a way of salvation has been provided. Shall Christ's great sacrifice be in vain? Shall the earth be entirely controlled by Satanic agencies? The salvation of souls is dependent upon the consecration and activity of God's church. The Lord calls upon all who believe in Him to be workers together with Him. While their life shall last they are not to feel that their work is done. Until the time comes when Christ shall say, \"It is finished,\" His work for the saving of souls will not decrease, but will grow in importance, and be far-reaching. . . .",
