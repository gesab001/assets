    "word": "Encourage the hearts of those for whom Christ has given His life. Lead them to understand that they are not to depend upon their surroundings for their Christian experience. It will cost you an effort to make them realize their responsibility to become laborers together with God. But consider that Christ, during the years of His earthly ministry, toiled all day, and often without success. Urge upon souls the eternal loss that all must sustain who refuse to give heart and mind and soul unreservedly to Christ. Every day passed in which Christ is refused admittance to the soul, is a day lost. Then show those for whom you labor how much is to be gained by surrender to God.",
