    "word": "Christ came to the earth to present a true and exalted standard. Brief as was the period of His public ministry, He accomplished the work He came to do. How impressive were the truths He taught, how complete His lifework! What spiritual food He daily imparted as He presented the bread of life to thousands of hungry souls. His life was a living ministry of the Word. He was the Light of the world, pointing to men the Way, the Truth, and the Life. He was its food, the Bread of life. He promised nothing that He did not perform. \"Ask,\" He said, \"and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\" (Matthew 7:7).",
