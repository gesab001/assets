    "word": "In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us. . . . \"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: . . .\" (Isaiah 9:6). God has adopted human nature in the person of His Son, and has carried the same into the highest heaven. It is the \"Son of man\" who shares the throne of the universe. . . . In Christ the family of earth and the family of heaven are bound together. Christ glorified is our brother. Heaven is enshrined in humanity, and humanity is enfolded in the bosom of Infinite Love.",
