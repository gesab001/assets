    "word": "What can we think of a people who have had no great light as the church at Battle Creek, who profess faith in the testimonies and then go directly against the light given. I shall not repeat again what has been so often repeated in favor of dress reform. I will state that the simple, modest, convenient and healthful style of dress we advocate answers to us as did the ribbon of blue to the children of Israel. \"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue. And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may \n                                                                           61\nlook upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them. And that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes. That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy into your God.\" The great God, the Maker of Heaven and earth, has condescended to the particulars of dress, specifying the style of dress the children of Israel should wear for the purpose of preserving their peculiarity from other nations, and distinguishing them as a people who acknowledged the Creator of the universe as their God, whose ordinances and commandments they obeyed.",
