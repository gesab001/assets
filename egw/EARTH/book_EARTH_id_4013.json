    "word": "Several centuries ago, parts of Switzerland were often visited by earthquakes. They have since entirely ceased; but floods, avalanches, snowstorms, and land-slides still threaten the inhabitants with frequent dangers. We passed through one scene of desolation caused by a land-slip in the summer of 1806. The season had been very rainy, and one afternoon about five o'clock a strata composed of flint rocks, limestone, and other soft formations, upwards of one mile in length, one thousand feet in breadth, and one hundred feet in thickness, was precipitated from a height of three thousand feet into the valley below, burying four villages, with four hundred and fifty-seven of the inhabitants. The scene of this catastrophe was between the celebrated Rossberg and Rigi mountains. From the top of the Rossberg to a point nearly half way up the Rigi the surface of the earth was converted into a rocky chaos. Time has covered these fragments of rock with moss and other vegetation, but the track of the slide can still be distinctly traced.",
