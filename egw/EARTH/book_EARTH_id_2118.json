    "word": "THIS PROPHECY OF JOEL, WHICH SPEAKS OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE LAST DAYS, WAS NOT ALL FULFILLED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL DISPENSATION. THIS IS EVIDENT FROM THE WONDERS IN HEAVEN AND IN EARTH, INTRODUCED IN THIS TEXT, WHICH WERE TO BE PRECURSORS OF \"THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE DAY OF THE LORD.\" THOUGH WE HAVE HAD THE SIGNS, THAT TERRIBLE DAY IS STILL IN THE FUTURE. THE WHOLE GOSPEL DISPENSATION MAY BE CALLED THE LAST DAYS, BUT TO SAY THAT THE LAST DAYS ARE ALL 1800 YEARS IN THE PAST, IS ABSURD. THEY REACH TO THE DAY OF THE LORD AND TO THE DELIVERANCE OF THE REMNANT OF GOD'S PEOPLE: \"FOR IN MOUNT ZION AND IN JERUSALEM SHALL BE DELIVERANCE, AS THE LORD HATH SAID, AND IN THE REMNANT WHOM THE LORD SHALL CALL.\" \n                                                                           143",
