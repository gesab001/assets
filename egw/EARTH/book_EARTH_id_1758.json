    "word": "105\nChapter 8 - \"The Labourer Is Worthy of His Hire\"\n\n     Lord, how shall I best serve and glorify Thy name in the earth? How shall I conduct my life to make Thy name a praise in the earth, and lead others to love, serve, and honor Thee? Let me only desire and choose Thy will. Let the words and example of my Redeemer be the light and strength of my heart. While I follow and trust in Him, He will not leave me to perish. He shall be my crown of rejoicing.\n --Review and Herald, Aug. 10, 1886",
