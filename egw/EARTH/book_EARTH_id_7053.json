    "word": "Growing Older but Continuing to Testify \n\nDear Brother [G. I.] Butler: \n     ... I greatly desire that the old soldiers, grown gray in the Master's service, shall continue to bear their testimony right to the point, that those younger in the faith may understand that the messages which the Lord gave us in the past are very important at this stage of the earth's history.  Our past experience has not lost one jot of its force.  I thank the Lord for every jot and tittle of the Sacred Word.  I would not draw back from the hard parts of our experience.",
