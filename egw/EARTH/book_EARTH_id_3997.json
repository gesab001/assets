    "word": "When tempted to sin, let us remember that Jesus is pleading for us in the heavenly sanctuary. When we put away our sins and come to him in faith, he takes our names in his lips and presents them to his Father, saying, \u201cI have graven them upon the palms of my hands; I know them by name.\u201d And the command goes forth to the angels to protect them. Then in the day of fierce trial he will say, \u201cCome, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.\u201d What are the chambers in which they are to hide? They are the protection of Christ and holy angels. The people of God are not at this time all in one place. They are in different companies, and in all parts of the earth; and they will be tried singly, not in groups. Every one must stand the test for himself.",
