    "word": "We do not know what faith really is until we try to exercise it. We all need more of that firm, persevering faith that Jacob manifested while wrestling with the angel on that eventful night. Few realize how severely his faith was tested at that time. He had separated himself from all earthly friends, that he might be alone with God. All who made life dear to him were exposed to danger and death. The bitterest drop in his cup of anguish was the thought that his own sin had brought this great peril upon his wives and children, who were innocent of the sin of which he was guilty. He had decided to spend the night in humiliation and prayer. God could soften the heart of his brother. God was his only refuge and strength. In a desolate place, infested by robbers and murderers, he bowed in deep distress upon the earth. His soul was rent with anguish, and with earnest cries mingled with tears he made his prayer before God. A strong hand is suddenly laid upon his shoulder. He immediately grapples his assailant, for he feels that this attack is a design upon his life; that he is in the hands of a robber or murderer.",
