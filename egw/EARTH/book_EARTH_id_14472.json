    "word": "\"If I act conscientiously, I must meet the crisis; for I believe that the precepts that the Lord has given concerning His work in the past and at the present time, point out the right way, and His plans, His thoughts, are much higher than man's plans, man's thoughts, as the heavens are higher than the earth. God's voice is to be heard; His wisdom is to guide us. We must not be broken up by any human wisdom or devising. God has outlined His plan in His Word, and in the Testimonies He has sent to His people.",
