    "word": "When unkind, discouraging words are spoken to you, do not retaliate. Do not reply unless you can return a pleasant answer. Say to yourself, \"I will not disappoint my Saviour.\" The Christian woman is a gentlewoman. On her lips is ever the law of kindness. She utters no hasty words. To speak gentle words when you are irritated will bring sunshine into your hearts and make your path more smooth. A schoolgirl, when asked for a definition of meekness, said, \"Meek people are those who give soft answers to rough questions.\" Christ says, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\" They will be fit subjects for the kingdom of heaven, for they are willing to be taught.-- Review and Herald, April 7, 1904.",
