    "word": "There are those who always take a negative position. This counts nothing toward building up the work. What has been done here in Michigan? What has been done in America, in the fields that have needed laborers and efficient helpers? I ask you what field where the people have never heard the truth, has been searched out and worked? Who has been preparing men to take hold of the field? And yet upon us rests the responsibility of fulfilling Christ's command, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" After Christ's baptism he preached the gospel to the cities that were round about. He was working and healing--the medical missionary work was bound up with the preaching of the gospel. I am so thankful for the medical missionary work, carried in gospel lines. It is to be taught, it is to be carried forward; for it is the very work that Christ did when on this earth. He was the greatest missionary the world ever saw.",
