    "word": "We must lift up the Man of Calvary; and may every one of you learn to exalt Christ before you leave this meeting,--before you go out to labor for others. May new chapters of experience open before you in regard to the confidence you may have in God. The Saviour asks, \"When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\" Satan has cast his dark shadow between you and your God; he has enshrouded the people in gross darkness. But you must have light from the throne of God; you must be rooted and grounded in the truth, so that when you come into the presence of those who cherish error, you may not be darkened by their influence, and be shaken away from the precious light.",
