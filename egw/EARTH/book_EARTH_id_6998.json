    "word": "All heaven is interested in the work that is going on in the earth today. The angels look with interest upon those who are honored in having a part to act as colaborers with God. When the servants of Christ have a realizing sense of the presence of One who is mighty to save, they will be filled with gratitude to God for the power of His grace. . . . Those who dedicate their all to Christ will learn how to win souls; for they will have a close connection with the Redeemer of the world. . . .",
