    "word": "This same covenant [the covenant of grace] was renewed to Abraham in the promise \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed\" (Genesis 22:18). This promise pointed to Christ. So Abraham understood it, and he trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sins. It was this faith that was accounted to him for righteousness. The covenant with Abraham also maintained the authority of God's law. The Lord appeared unto Abraham, and said, \"I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect\" (Genesis 17:1). The testimony of God concerning His faithful servant was, \"Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws\" (Genesis 26:5). . . .",
