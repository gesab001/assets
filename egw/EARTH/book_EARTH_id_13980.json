    "word": "The Work in the Southern Field \n     There is a great work to be done in the Southern field. This is one of the barren places of the earth to be worked. But inexperienced young men and young women should not be asked to go to this field as laborers. There are married men and women of experience who can settle in the large Southern cities to work \n\n\n                                   -248- \n\nfor the white people, as well as the colored people. The unpromising condition of the field should not deter anyone from laboring there.",
