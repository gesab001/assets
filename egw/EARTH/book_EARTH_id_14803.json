    "word": "The sophistries used by selfish, avaricious men, to bring in self-serving, were wrong from the very first.

Had they been eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God, what would have been their experience? \"He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.\" \"As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, even so he shall live by me.\"",
