    "word": "God's benevolent design embraces every branch of his work. The law of reciprocal dependence and influence is to be recognized and obeyed. None of us liveth to himself.\" The enemy has used the chain of dependence to draw men together. They have united to destroy God's image in man. To counter work the gospel by perverting its principles. They are represented in God's word as being bound up in bundles to be burned. Satan is uniting his forces for perdition. The unity of God's chosen people has been terribly shaken. God presents a remedy. This remedy is not one influence among many influences, and on the same level with them: it is an influence above all influences upon the face of the earth, corrective, uplifting and ennobling. Those who work in the Gospel should be elevated and sanctified; they are dealing with God's great principles. Yoked up with Christ, they are laborers together with God. Thus the Lord will bind His followers together, that they may be a power for good, each acting his part, yet all cherishing the sacred principles of dependence on the Great Head.",
