    "word": "Throughout His entire earthly life the Lord Jesus Christ was seeking to impress His divine image upon man. He is our sin-bearer. He desires to help you carry His cross in service. In trial He is close beside you, trying to lead you to realize how sorry He is when you make mistakes. He is always ready to reach out for the hand that is stretched out for help. Remember always that it is not a human heart, a human sympathy, that draws us to Christ, it is a love that is divine, that blends with the love of the human agents. Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. How? By making them His own.",
