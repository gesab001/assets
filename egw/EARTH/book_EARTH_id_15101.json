    "word": "J. A. Burden: The governments of earth provide that if we conduct a medical school, we must take a charter from the government. That in itself has nothing to do with how the school is conducted. It is required, however, that certain studies shall be taught. There are ten subjects required. Physiology is one of these. It is required that those who labor as physicians shall be proficient in these subjects. In starting our sanitariums for the care of the sick, we must secure a charter from the government; our printing offices must do the same. Would the securing of a charter for a medical school, where our students might obtain a medical education, militate against our depending upon God.?",
