    "word": "The Terror of the Lost \n\n     When the earth is reeling to and fro like a drunkard, when the heavens are shaking and the great day of the Lord has come, who shall be able to stand? One object they behold in trembling agony from which they will try in vain to escape. \"Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him\" (Revelation 1:7). The unsaved utter wild imprecations to dumb nature--their god: \"Mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne\" (Revelation 6:16).--TMK 356 (1896).",
