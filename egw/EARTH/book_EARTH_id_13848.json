    "word": "It is not alone by the men in high places of responsibility in the ministry or in any other lines of work, not alone by men holding positions on boards or committees or by the managers of our sanitariums and publishing houses, that the work is to be done that will cause the earth to be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. This work can be done only by the whole church acting their part under the guidance and in the power of Jesus Christ.--Ms 72, 1902. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Nov. 5, Entire Ms.",
