    "word": "Chapter 23 \n\n     16 (John 7). Christ's Sacrifice Provides Bounties.--The rivers of blood that flowed at the harvest thanksgiving, when the sacrifices were offered in such large numbers, were meant to teach a great truth. For even the productions of the earth, the bounties provided for man's sustenance, we are indebted to the offering of Christ upon the cross of Calvary. God teaches us that all we receive from Him is the gift of redeeming love (RH Nov. 10, 1896).",
