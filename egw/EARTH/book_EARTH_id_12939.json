    "word": "Rain, None Before the Flood.--After seven days it began to rain. Up to this time there had been no rain, there had a mist arisen to water the earth but as the rain began to fall slowly at first, then more came, they began to inquire, What shall this come to? And at last the heavens were opened and the rain poured down in torrents.--Ms 32, 1886.",
