He who created man and who understands his needs appointed Adam his food. \"Behold,\" He said, \"I have given you every herb yielding seed, . . . and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.\" Genesis 1:29, A.R.V. Upon leaving Eden to gain his livelihood by tilling the earth under the curse of sin, man received permission to eat also \n222\n\"the herb of the field.\" Genesis 3:18.",
