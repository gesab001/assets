    "word": "In the fulness of time Christ came, and in human nature lived on this earth a life unmarred by spot or stain of sin. With His whole being He hated sin of any kind. The emissaries of darkness give Christ the credit for being the one who expelled them from heaven. They hate Him for His purity. When He came to this world, His purity was a constant reproach to the proud, sensual generation then living on the earth. They hated Him, and in the end crucified Him.",
