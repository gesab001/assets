    "word": "Stewards of Christ's Grace--Why are so many who profess to be children of God devoting their God-entrusted capabilities to selfish purposes? They are stewards of the grace of Christ, and should lift up Jesus before the world. They should talk of Christ. His praise should be on their lips because the Sun of Righteousness is shining in their hearts. Through them His holy name should be exalted in the earth.--RH Aug. 16, 1898.",
