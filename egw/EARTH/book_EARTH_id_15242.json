    "word": "Many convicted and converted will bow in humility before the Lord, making an unreserved consecration of themselves to Him. The message is to go to all parts of the world. \"Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.\" The words inscribed on the Lord's temple harmonize with his unlimited invitation of mercy. \"My house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.\" It shall proclaim that I am the living God, sit upon my throne as ruler, giving audience to the world. And what is the response?--\"Let all the people praise thee, O God, let all the people praise thee, and let the whole earth be filled with thy glory.\"",
