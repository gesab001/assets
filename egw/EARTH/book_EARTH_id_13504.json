    "word": "My brother, look unto Jesus. You need not look to any human agency for the supply of grace that you can find in its perfection in Christ. The Saviour took human nature upon Him, and came to this earth, and in His humanity He was tempted in all points like as human beings are tempted. Thus was removed every excuse for the plea that Christ does not know that temptations come to man. The Saviour came to succor all who are tempted.",
