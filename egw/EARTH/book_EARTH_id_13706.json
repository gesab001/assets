    "word": "The parable of the talents is given to represent the kingdom of heaven, and to show the necessity of an accurate use of the endowments that God has \n\n\n                                   -272- \n\nentrusted to us. It is of the highest importance that we understand these parables and know wherein they have any bearing upon us individually. The ten virgins are represented as watching in the evening of this earth's history. They represent the church of professed Christians. This lesson should fill our minds with serious thought, and drive us to our Bibles, the Word of the living God. It should lead us to most earnest supplication that God will lead us into all truth.",
