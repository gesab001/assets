    "word": "In the day of His coming, the last great trumpet is heard, and there is a terrible shaking of earth and heaven.

The fire having fulfilled its mission, the dead that have been laid away in the grave will come forth--some to the resurrection of life, to be caught up to meet their Lord in the air, and some to behold the coming of Him whom they have despised and whom they now recognize as the Judge of all the earth.",
