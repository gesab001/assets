    "word": "We have reason to praise God with heart and voice. \"Ye are My witnesses,\" He says. Amazing condescension on the part of Christ! To all who seek Him at the footstep of mercy He gives power to witness for Him. The Lord Jesus has placed Himself under obligation never to disappoint a true seeker for the Holy Spirit's guidance. He presents the earthly to represent the heavenly. He appeals to the love of earthly parents. \"What man is there of you,\" He says, \"whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"--Letter 68, 1900. \n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nSeptember 14, 1989. Entire Letter.",
