    "word": "\u201cO that these covetous ones could get a view of Heaven,\u2014of its purity, its loveliness,\u2014and behold the holy angels engaged in working for the salvation of man! All Heaven astir! Angels \n337\nare going forth on their mission, descending to watch over the tempted children of God, and to shield them from the power of the evil angels. And while these angels are descending, others are ascending to bear their tidings. Angels are constantly passing and repassing each other in their upward and downward flight, fulfilling their mission of love. I would that all could get sight of this; I think that they would catch a little of the zeal and fervor of these devoted angels, which they manifest for the salvation of man. It would inspire them with that interest which would call forth effort, and they would cheerfully sacrifice for the salvation of their fellow-men. In addition to this, all the happiness derived from earth, and from a selfish hoarding of earth's treasure, would appear so meager, compared with the beauty and unsurpassed glory of Heaven, that earth's treasures would be eclipsed, and would appear but dross could they win the heavenly treasure.",
