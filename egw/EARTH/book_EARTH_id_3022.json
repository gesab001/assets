    "word": "Christ will not be satisfied until the victory is complete, and \"He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied\" (Isaiah 53:11). All the nations of the earth shall hear the gospel of His grace. Not all will receive His grace; but \"a seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation\" (Psalm 22:30). \"The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High,\" and the \"earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\" \"So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun\" (Daniel 7:27; Isaiah 11:9; 59:19).",
