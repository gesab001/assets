    "word": "The ladder represented Christ. He is the channel of communication between heaven and earth, and angels go to and fro in continual intercourse with the fallen race. The words of Christ to Nathanael were in harmony with the figure of the ladder, when He said, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man\" (John 1:51). Here the Redeemer identifies Himself as the mystic ladder that makes communication possible between heaven and earth. . . .",
