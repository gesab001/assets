    "word": "This earth is the place of preparation for heaven. The time spent here is the Christian's winter. Here the chilly winds of affliction blow upon us, and the waves of trouble roll against us. But in the near future, when Christ comes, sorrow and sighing will be forever ended. Then will be the Christian's summer. All trials will be over, and there will be no more sickness or death. \"God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things have passed away.\"--Ms 28, 1886, pp. 1-4. (\"The Hope Set Before Us,\" sermon at Nimes, France, Oct. 24, 1886.)",
