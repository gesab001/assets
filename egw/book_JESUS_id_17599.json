Here are the conditions upon which every soul will be elected to eternal life. Your obedience to God\\92s commandments will prove your right to an inheritance with the saints in light. God has elected a certain excellence of character; and everyone who, through the grace of Christ, shall reach the standard of His requirement will have an abundant entrance into the kingdom of glory. All who would reach this standard of character will have to employ the means that God has provided to this end.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 129}
