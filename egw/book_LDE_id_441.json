{"word": "The prophet saw \"four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.\" Another angel, ascending from the east, cried to them, saying, \"Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.\" This points out the work we now have to do, which is to cry to God for the angels to hold the four winds until missionaries shall be sent to all parts of the world, and shall have proclaimed the warning against disobeying the law of Jehovah.--RH Extra, Dec. 11, 1888.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 125}
