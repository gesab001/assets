{"word": "The inhabitants of the world, under Satan's leadership, are binding up in bundles ready to be burned. We have no time, not a moment, to lose. The judgments of God are in the land, and those who stand obstinate, unconvinced by the warnings that God sends, will be bound up in bundles ready to be burned. Let ministers and church members go forth into the vineyard. They will find their harvest wherever they proclaim the forgotten truths of the Bible. Missionaries, men and women, are needed. They will find those who accept the truth, and take their position beside their teacher to win souls to Christ. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 163}
