{"word": "Avoid a Hard, Loveless Religion.--I raise my voice against this...iron, hard, loveless religion. If A and B had cherished far less of self and far more of Jesus Christ, they would have been continually learning, continually growing into Christ's spirit and Christ's mind, reflecting His character in unselfishness and love while connected with the publishing office; and today they would have been connected with the publishing house and would have been on vantage ground. But, oh, what a lack has there been of the genuine, holy love of God in the Review and Herald office. Had the first love been burning on the altar of their hearts, it would have been exhibited in tenderness, in compassion, in unselfish acts, and God's blessing would have been upon them; but when self is continually cherished, God has no use for such workers.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 132}
