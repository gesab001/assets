{"word": "Angels of God are watching the children with the deepest interest, to see what characters they develop. \n                                                                           132\nIf Christ dealt with us as we often deal with each other, and with our children, we should stumble and fall through utter discouragement. I saw that Jesus knows our infirmities, and himself hath felt their experience in all things but in sin, therefore he hath proportioned a way and a path to our strength and capacity, and, like Jacob, hath marched softly and in evenness with the children as they were able to endure, that he might entertain us by the comfort of his company, and be to us a perpetual guide. He does not despise, neglect, or leave behind the children of the flock.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "4bSG", "page": 131}
