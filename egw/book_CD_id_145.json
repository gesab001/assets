{"word": "\"Do All to the Glory of God\" \n\n     (1896) Special Testimonies, Series A, No. 9, p. 58 \n\n\n     75. By the inspiration of the Spirit of God, Paul the apostle writes that \"whatsoever ye do,\" even the natural act of eating or drinking, should be done, not to gratify a perverted appetite, but under a sense of responsibility,--\"do all to the glory of God.\" Every part of the man is to be guarded; we are to beware lest that which is taken into the stomach shall banish from the mind high and holy thoughts. May I not do as I please with myself? ask some, as if we were seeking to deprive them of a great good, when we present before them the necessity of eating intelligently, and conforming all their habits to the laws God has established.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 56}
