    "word": "\"For His disciples Christ prayed: \"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.\" A pleasant, self-satisfied feeling is not an evidence of sanctification. A faithful record is kept of all the acts of the children of men. Nothing can be concealed from the eye of the high and holy One that inhabiteth eternity. Some make Christ ashamed of them by their devising and planning and scheming. God does not approve of their conduct, for the Lord Jesus is dishonored by their spirit and their works. They forget the words of the apostle: \"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\" 1 Corinthians 4:9.",
