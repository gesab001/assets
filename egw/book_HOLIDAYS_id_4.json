{"word": "Chap. Seventy-Six - Holidays And Anniversaries\n\n     The Need of Guidance in Holiday Observance.-- I saw that our holidays should not be spent in patterning after the world, yet they should not be passed by unnoticed, for this will bring dissatisfaction to our children. On these days when there is danger that our children will be exposed to evil influences and become corrupted by the pleasures and excitement of the world, let the parents study to get up something to take the place of more dangerous amusements. Give your children to understand that you have their good and happiness in view.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AH", "page": 472}
