{"word": "Encourage a Happy Frame of Mind.--If there is anyone who should be continually grateful, it is the Christian. If there is anyone who enjoys happiness, even in this life, it is the faithful follower of Jesus Christ. It is the duty of God's children to be cheerful. They should encourage a happy frame of mind. God cannot be glorified by His children living continually under a cloud and casting a shadow wherever they go. The Christian should cast sunshine instead of a shadow. . . . He will bear a cheerful countenance.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 147}
