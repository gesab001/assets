    "word": "The thrilling truth that has been sounding in our ears for many years, \"The Lord is at hand; be ye also ready,\" is no less the truth today than when we first heard the message. The dearest interests of the church and people of God, and the destiny of an impenitent and ungodly world, for time and for eternity, are here involved. We are all judgment bound. \"The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and \n                                                                           15\nthe dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain [unto the coming of the Lord] shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\" Christ will then be revealed from heaven, \"taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel.\"",
