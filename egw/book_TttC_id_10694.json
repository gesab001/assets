He says: \"I will turn My hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin: and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city. Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.\" Isaiah 1:25-27. These \n                                                                           153\nwords are full of importance. They have a lesson for all who occupy the editorial chair.",
