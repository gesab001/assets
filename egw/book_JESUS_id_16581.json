{"word": "K.--57--'96 \n     Health reform is as closely related to the gospel as the arm is to the body; but the arm can not take the place of the body. The proclamation of the gospel message, the commandments of God, and the testimony of Jesus, is the burden of our work. This message is to be proclaimed with a loud voice, and is to go to the whole world. The presentation of health principles is to be united with the proclamation of this message, but it is not in any way to take the place of it, or be independent of it.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSDF", "page": 88}
