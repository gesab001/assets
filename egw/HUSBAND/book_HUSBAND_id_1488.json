    "word": "\"Vain philosophy.\" The members of the body are controlled by the head. Spiritualists lay aside the Head, and every member of the body they believe must act themselves, and fixed laws will lead them on in a state of progression to perfection without a head. John 15:1-6. \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.\"",
