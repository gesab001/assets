    "word": "We had the care of building with hired money, which caused perplexity. We kept up our appointments and labored extremely hard all through the hot weather. For want of means we went into the field together, hoeing, and cutting and raking hay. I took the fork and built the stack, while my husband, with his feeble arms, pitched the hay to me. I took the brush and painted the inside of much of our house. In these things we both wearied ourselves too much. Finally I suddenly failed and could do no more. For several mornings I fainted, and my husband had to attend the Greenbush grove meeting without me.",
