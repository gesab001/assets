    "word": "I feel perfectly safe with May under your care, and I did not propose her going to Brother Lockwood's because I had any lack of confidence in you, but only for the reasons I have named. I have written to Brother Lockwood to rent my house if possible. If he should do this, then I would want May to be with you, and if she makes a wise improvement of her time, continue at the school. Brother Lockwood may be able to rent the house; if not, it will be an expense to me rather than an income. You are on the ground and I am not. I leave it to you and your husband's judgment to do as you think I would do if I were there in regard to May.",
