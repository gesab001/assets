    "word": "MR No. 1426 - Ellen White Acknowledges Her Imperfection\n\n     (Written to \"Dear Husband,\" May 16, 1876, from Oakland, California.) \n\n     It grieves me that I have said or written anything to grieve you. Forgive me and I will be cautious not to start any subject to annoy and distress you. We are living in a most solemn time and we cannot afford to have in our old age [ELLEN WHITE WAS 48 YEARS OF AGE AND HER HUSBAND WAS 54 WHEN THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN.] differences to separate our feelings. I may not view all things as you do, but I do not think it would be my place or duty to try to make you see as I see and feel as I feel. Wherein I have done this, I am sorry.",
