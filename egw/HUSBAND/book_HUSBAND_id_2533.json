    "word": "Wallings Mills, Colo., Monday, Oct. 20, 1873. We had some important writing to do, which kept my husband busily at it until time to take his seat in the wagon. We took Sister Hall and Addie and May Walling with us. We ate our dinner on the way to Black Hawk. The day was very mild and the children enjoyed the ride very much. We traded some in Black Hawk and in Central [City]. We did not get home until after sundown. . . . My husband wrote letters after he returned home. Sat up quite late answering letters.",
