    "word": "I see by your letter you fear we have moved too fast in sending to Czechowski. We have not sent yet and shall not till you return. We did not think of sending much, only those things sent in for the poor and clothes that George or some others could not wear. But it will take time to get up a box and I am desirous to have brought in from other places what is on hand.--Letter 13, 1860, pp. 1, 2. (To \"Dear Husband,\" November 7, 1860.)",
