    "word": "(Brother and Sister R, Senior) I saw that old Brother R has been under the cloud in darkness, but the cloud was passing away. The spirit of his companion is displeasing to God. She does not take a course to make herself and Brother R happy. There is too much fretting, complaining, and groaning. I saw that she did not look upon her past course in the right light. Had she conducted herself properly, they need not now be homeless and Brother R be compelled to labor so hard to obtain the necessaries of life. Brother R's course has been all wrong in the past, but it was the injudicious, determined course of his wife that drove him to desperation, and she should now take a very humble place in the church, for she has brought a stain upon \n\n\n                              -331- \n\nthe cause of God. I saw that she must yield her set will, her complaining, and possess a cheerful disposition, yield to her husband and make him happy.",
