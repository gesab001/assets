    "word": "My husband is fast wearing. We attended the four camp-meetings west. Our brethren are urging our attending the camp-meetings east. But we dare not take additional burdens upon us. We came from the labor of camp-meetings west, in July, 1871, to find a large amount of business that had been left to accumulate in my husband's absence. We have seen no opportunity for rest yet. My husband must be released from the burdens upon him. There are too many that use his brain in the place of using their own. In view of the light which God has been pleased to give us, we plead for you, my brethren, to release my husband. I am not willing to venture the consequences of his going forward and laboring as he has done. He served you faithfully and unselfishly for years, and finally fell under the pressure of the burdens placed upon him. Then his brethren, in whom he had confided, left him. They let him drop into my hands, and forsook him. I was his nurse, his attendant, and physician, for nearly two years. I do not wish to pass through the experience a second time. \n                                                                           48\nBrethren, will you lift the burdens from us, and allow us to preserve our strength as God would have us, that the cause at large may be benefited with the efforts we may make in his strength? Or will you leave us to become debilitated so that we will become useless to the cause? \n\n                                               -",
