    "word": "Vulgar Speaking to Be Avoided.--Fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, I beseech you, do not indulge in low thought and vulgar speaking. Coarse sayings, low jests, want of courtesy in the homelife, will \n\n\n                                                 157 \n\nleave an impression upon you, and if frequently repeated will become second nature. The home is too sacred a place to be polluted with vulgarity, sensuality, and recrimination. There is a Witness who declares, \"I know thy works.\" Let love, truth, kindness, and forbearance be the plants cultivated in the garden of the heart.--Lt 18b, 1891.",
