    "word": "Be careful how you build, for it is for time and for eternity. Counsel together, have your seasons of prayer together; make no move independently or in opposition to one another. Christ is our living head, and we are members of His body, and all dependent upon the head. It is not our Lord's plan that any member of His body shall suffer for want of proper exercise; for if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; if one is enlightened and honoured of God, all rejoice. Every member derives its life and working power from the same source, \u201ceven Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.\u201d \u201cAnd the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary.\u201d \u201cFor we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\u201d Each worker is to use his God-given ability to the utmost for the upbuilding of Christ's kingdom on the earth. We each have an individuality in manner and bearing, and this is as it should be; but this need not prevent our working together in perfect harmony.",
