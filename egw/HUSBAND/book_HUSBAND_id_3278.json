    "word": "Years ago, my husband and I used to study how we should manage perplexing matters in the office, and deal with men of peculiar temperaments. . . \"Well,\" my husband used to say, \"let us pray about it.\" And so we would kneel down, often in the night season, and we would pray the Lord to pen the way, so that we could approach men wisely, and give them the right instruction. Afterward, when we would try to talk kindly with them, and yet plainly, they would almost always yield. They did not always remain steadfast in their determination to pursue a right course; and because they returned to their former ways, we often had the same battle to fight over and over again. But whatever the matters might be, we felt that the Lord knew all about them, that He could tell us how to act, and that He could move on hearts. . .",
