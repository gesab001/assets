    "word": "Healdsburg, Cal., Feb. 17, 1884. \nDear Brother and Sister_____: \n\n\n     I have been thinking much of the Health Institute at St. Helena. My thoughts crowd into my mind, and I wish to express some of them to you. I am sure that_____has a work to do for herself which she does not realize. All that she has thought and done, and all that her husband has thought and done, she has looked up as beyond criticism, as just right. I know that this is a deception of the enemy. If anything is said to question her course or his, it appears to both of you that you are treated unjustly. This deception of the enemy \n\n\n                                   - 69 - \n\nwill have to be broken before you will be right.",
