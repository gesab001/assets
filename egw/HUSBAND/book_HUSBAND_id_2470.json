    "word": "We were rejoiced to see Brother Radley at this meeting. He came on Sunday, and remained until the meeting closed, Wednesday. We have felt great anxiety for him. His wife embraced the truth first, and he came along more slowly. He was very cautious in regard to committing himself. We visited him, and saw that he was a man of few words, and seldom attended our meetings. I talked with him personally in regard to his responsibilities as a husband and father. He has two boys, little lads, and three girls. All are interesting, and at an age when they need the leading and guiding of a father. The mother has done the best she could.",
