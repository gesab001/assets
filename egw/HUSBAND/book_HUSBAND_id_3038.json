    "word": "Walling's Mills, Wednesday, September 3, 1873. Brother and Sister Downs went with us to gather raspberries. We took dinner in the tent and had a very pleasant time with our brother and sister. We gathered about twenty-six quarts. Lucinda canned about eleven cans in the tent. We brought home about ten quarts of berries. My husband invited Mr. Parker, the editor, to come home with us. We had a very social chat with him. Preparing his supper and getting supper for two hungry men made our work hard. Sister Hall had to bake. We sat up till ten helping her. For two nights she did not get to rest until midnight.",
