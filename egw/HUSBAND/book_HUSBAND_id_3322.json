    "word": "There were some men and women who invested means in the Publishing Association as a donation. Afterwards, through misfortune they were brought to actual distress and want. When my husband was stricken down by disease they came to the ones who occupied his place, and begged that some of the means which they had invested in good faith should be returned to them. The matter was treated on the policy plan, that business is business, religion is religion. The managers reasoned that nothing donated to the cause should be returned to the donors under any circumstances, and they took no measures to relieve the situation of those in distress. When my husband returned to his position in the office, these persons laid the matter before him. In the case of means donated by widows, my husband had objected when it was freely offered, and had entered upon the books the statement that the money should be repaid when donors needed it. Notwithstanding this, their cases were passed by with indifference. Such management may be dictated by worldly policy, but it is not in accordance with the character of Christ. We can best serve the cause of God by ever considering in tenderness the needs of suffering humanity.",
