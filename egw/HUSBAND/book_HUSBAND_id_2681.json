    "word": "Wright, Sunday, April 26, 1868--Attended meeting. My husband spoke in the forenoon on the tenth of Revelation. . . . It was an interesting subject. I spoke in the afternoon upon brotherly love--\"I was an hungered and ye gave me no meat, thirsty,\" etc. I was quite free. After meeting closed we went two miles to the water and baptized eight. Brother Kellogg spoke in the evening upon the health question. I was too weary to go out. We feel an interest for the people.--Ms 15, 1868, pp. 8, 9. (Diary, April 1 to 30, 1868.)",
