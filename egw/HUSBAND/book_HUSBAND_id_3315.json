Then he led them from the upper chamber out through the city to the Mount of Olives. On their way they passed a beautiful vine, and the disciples charmed with its loveliness, called the Saviour's attention to it. As they looked upon it, Christ said, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\"",
