    "word": "Religion the True Science of Healing.--Religion is a principle of the heart, not a magical word or a trick of the mind. Look to Jesus only. This is your only hope and your husband's only hope of gaining eternal life. This is the true science of healing for body and soul. The mind must not be centered upon any human being, but upon God.-- Lt 117, 1901.",
