    "word": "Chapter XVII. - Visit to Mass. and N. H.\n\n     One morning at family prayer, at Bro. Howland's, I was shown that it was duty for us to go to Dartmouth, Mass. Soon after, my husband went to the post-office and brought a letter from Bro. Collins, urging us to come to Dartmouth, for their son was very sick. We immediately went, and found Bro. Collins' son, thirteen years old, had been sick nine weeks with the whooping cough, and was wasted almost to a skeleton. He had fits of coughing \n                                                                           109\nwhich would stop his breath, and his father was obliged to rush to the door with him in his arms that he might regain his breath.",
