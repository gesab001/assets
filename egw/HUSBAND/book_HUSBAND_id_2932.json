    "word": "\"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase\" [1 Corinthians 3:6]. These were men ordained of God as His helping hand to do this work; if they became exalted because of their success, and lifted up their souls unto vanity, the Lord would remove their light from them. \"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither is he that watereth; but God that \n\n\n                               -198- \n\ngiveth the increase\" [verse 7]. Now the wise conclusion: \"Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we are laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" [verses 8, 9].",
