    "word": "Husbands and wives should feel it their privilege and their duty to reserve for the privacy of each other's society the interchange of love \n\n\n                                 -140- \n\ntokens between themselves. For while the manifestation of love for each other is right in its place, it may be made productive of harm to both the married and the unmarried. There are persons of an entirely different cast of mind and character, and of different education and training, who love each other just as devotedly and healthfully as do those who have educated themselves to manifest their affection freely; and there is danger that by contrast these persons who are more reserved will be misjudged, and placed at a disadvantage.",
