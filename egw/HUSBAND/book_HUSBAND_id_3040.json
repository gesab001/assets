    "word": "Walling's Mills, Sabbath, September 6, 1873. We had a rainy day. About nine o'clock a gentleman on horseback inquired if we had seen \n\n\n                                     -206- \n\ntwo men pass. I had seen them about midnight going by our house. They stopped to drink at the spring and then started up the hill on the road to Black Hawk upon the run. These men had been stealing and the authorities were in search of them. Mr. Walling and an officer rode up to the door. Mr. Walling ate a lunch, changed horses and drove on. I wrote to Elder Loughborough. My husband also wrote a letter; sent by Mr. Walling.",
