    "word": "(Denver) Sabbath, June 28, 1873--We have another beautiful day, but quite warm. We took our writing and walked quite a distance to the shade of a tree to find a quiet place to write. We enjoyed the quiet, but the shade was not sufficient to prevent our being burned by the sun. My husband corrected a sermon which has been reported to be put in Review. We took our simple lunch under the tree. About noon we saw a covered carriage coming towards us. It was Mr. Walling. We decided to start after sundown that night for the mountains. We did not get away from the city until past eight o'clock. We traveled to Golden City and put up at a hotel. We did not get to rest before one o'clock. \n\n\n                                  -124-",
