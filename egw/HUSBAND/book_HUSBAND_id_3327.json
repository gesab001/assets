    "word": "The farm should have careful husbandry. We are sorry that Brother Jacobs has been obliged to leave Huntsville. He has left, not because of unfaithfulness or inefficiency, but because of the condition of his health and the feebleness of Sister Jacobs, brought on by hard work. Brother and Sister Jacobs should have had the help of others who were spiritual minded and intelligent. It may be that if proper facilities are provided to make the labor on the farm less taxing, Brother Jacobs might be encouraged to return and resume his work. If he should return, however, he should have able assistants to work with him.",
