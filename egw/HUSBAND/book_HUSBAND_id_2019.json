Admonition to Walter's Second Mother-in-law \n\n     Dear Sister: [WRITTEN AUGUST 26, 1895, TO THE MOTHER OF WALTER C'S SECOND WIFE.] In regard to the marriage of your daughter with Walter C, I see where you are troubled. But the marriage took place with your consent, and your daughter, knowing all about him, accepted him as her husband; and now I can see no reason why you should carry any burden over this matter. Your daughter loves Walter C, and it may be that this marriage is in the order of God in order that both Walter and your daughter may have a richer Christian experience and be built up where they are deficient. Your \n                                                                           68\ndaughter has pledged herself to Walter C in marriage, and to break her marriage vows would be far from right. She cannot now disannul her obligations to him.",
