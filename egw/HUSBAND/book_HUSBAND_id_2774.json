    "word": "Vina Belden Wished to Stay on Norfolk Island--I received in the Australian mail a letter from Vina Belden, who is still living on Norfolk Island. She writes that she has had an ill turn, but is improving. Her trouble was heart difficulty. I wish for many reasons that she could leave the island, but the people there do not want her to leave, and she herself wants to remain. Indeed, I do not think anyone could persuade her to go. She desires to be buried beside her husband.--Letter 308, 1907, p. 2. (To Mrs. Mary P. Foss, September 30, 1907.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. July 23, 1980",
