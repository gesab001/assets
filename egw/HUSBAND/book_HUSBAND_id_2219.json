    "word": "I have been shown families where the husband and father has not preserved that reserve, that dignified, godlike manhood which a follower of Jesus Christ should. He has failed in his kind, tender, courteous acts due to his wife, whom he has promised before God and angels to love and respect and honor while they both shall live. The girl employed to do the work has been free and somewhat forward in her attentions to dress his hair and be affectionately attentive, and he is pleased, foolishly pleased. He is not as demonstrative in his attention and love as he once was to his wife. Be sure Satan is at work here. Respect your hired help, treat them kindly, considerately, but go no farther. Let your deportment be such that there will be no advances to familiarity from your help. If you have words of kindness and acts of courtesy to give, it is always safe to give them to your wife. It will be a great blessing to her, and will bring happiness to her \n                                                                           34\nheart which will be reflected back upon you again. Also, I have been shown that the wife has let her sympathies and interest and affection go out to other men. They may be members of the family, whom she makes confidants, relating her troubles and, perhaps, her private family matters, to them. She shows a preference for their society.",
