    "word": "You are in a hard field, but it is where God would have you. There is work to be done, but you will be surprised when I tell you that in order to do it, you must work less. You must husband your vital forces in order to accomplish more and better work. Counsel with your brethren, and work in harmony with them; they will be a strength rather than a hindrance to you. Do not try to go on your own independent judgment.",
