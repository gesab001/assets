    "word": "MR No. 1351 - Counsel Not to Return to Husband, But to Work in a Sanitarium\n\n               (Written April 6, 1907, to Mrs. Walter Harper.) \n\n     I have received your letter, and in reply to it I would say, I cannot advise you to return to Walter Harper unless you see decided changes in him. The Lord is not pleased with the ideas he has had in the past of what is due to a wife. At one time I spoke very plainly to Walter in regard to his responsibilities to his wife. It is very clear to me that it would be a mistake for you to be united again while your love for him is quenched. He cannot make you happy unless his views are changed.",
