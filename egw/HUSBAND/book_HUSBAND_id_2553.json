    "word": "Sister _____ and her husband were at the meeting. . . . Her husband opposed her much and has while intoxicated presented to her head a loaded pistol, but the Lord has kept her from being harmed. . . . About one month ago this violent man was thoroughly converted. He has no appetite, he says, for liquor, and his bloated appearance has changed. He looks like a quiet, pleasant man.--Letter 3, 1861, p. 1. (To Henry, Edson, and Willie White, March 18, 1861.)",
