    "word": "I had a lengthy interview with a sister of Sister Bowen. She has an unbelieving husband who opposes her violently and is cruel and abusive to her and to her children. She attended this meeting without his knowledge, on her way to visit her father and mother. She knows not what is before her. Her husband found her reading the Bible. He took the large family Bible, cut out the family record, besmeared its pages with kerosene oil, and threw it into the fire. He burns all her books and papers if he can find them. His ingenuity to discover anything that is of a religious character and consume it, is satanic. The enmity of Satan against God and the truth is not abated, and we need to be imbued with the Spirit of God.--Ms. 44, 1890, pp. 4-5 (Diary 16, pp. 288-289).",
