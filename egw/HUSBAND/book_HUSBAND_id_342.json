    "word": "Very many families are living in a most unhappy state, because the husband and father allows the animal in his nature to predominate over the intellectual and moral. The result is that a sense of languor and depression is frequently felt, but the cause is seldom divined as being the result of their own improper course of action. We are under solemn obligations to God to keep the spirit pure and the body healthy, that we may be a benefit to humanity, and render to God perfect service. The apostle utters these words of warning: \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\" Romans 6:12. He urges us onward by telling us that \"every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.\" 1 Corinthians 9:25. He exhorts all who call themselves Christians to present their bodies \"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\" Romans 12:1. He says, \"I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\" 1 Corinthians 9:27.",
