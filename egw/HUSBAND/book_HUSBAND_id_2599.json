    "word": "MR No. 326 - Sacrificing for the Cause\n\n     We know best how this cause started. We have studied, in every way, ways and means in order that we might have something to carry us from place to place in the cause of truth. To reach the very first conference that we ever had in the State of Connecticut, my husband worked at cutting cordwood at twenty-five cents a cord. He was not used to work, and the rheumatism came in his wrists so that night after night he was unable to sleep because of the pain. Our prayers ascended night after night that God would relieve him from pain. . . . He would say, \"Wife, we must be sure to keep $5.00 by us, and if we come short of means we will not use that five dollars.\"",
