    "word": "MR No. 1436 - The High Honor of Being a Child of God\n\n     (Written to \"Dear Sister Gosrick,\" June 1, 1898, from Sunnyside, Cooranbong, N.S.W.) \n\n\n     I commenced a letter to you, and had it nearly finished, but was called away, and now I cannot find it. I will write a few lines to you. I feel deep sympathy for you, knowing that you are sorely tempted. The enemy is trying to make you faint and become discouraged. I feel no less sympathy and deep interest for your husband. Our Saviour will be his Saviour if he will accept Him. Never, never are any of us to feel that it is anything but the highest honor to become the sons and daughters of God.",
