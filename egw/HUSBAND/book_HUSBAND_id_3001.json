    "word": "No one can so effectually ruin a woman's happiness and usefulness as her own husband. Heaven has registered the words and actions of men who have tyrannized over their wives. And no one can do one hundredth part as much to chill the hopes and aspirations of a man, no one can paralyze his energies and make life a heart-sickening burden as [can] his own wife; and she may ruin his influence and his prospects. From the marriage hour many men can date their success or their failure.",
