    "word": "Adam and Eve were permitted to eat of all the trees in their Eden home, save one. The Lord said to the holy pair, \u201cIn the day that ye eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, ye shall surely die.\u201d [See Genesis 3.] Eve was beguiled by the serpent, and made to believe that God would not do as he had said. She ate, and thinking she felt the sensation of a new and more exalted life, she bore the fruit to her husband. The serpent had said that she should not die, and she felt no ill effects from eating the fruit,\u2014nothing which could be interpreted to mean death, but, instead, a pleasurable sensation, which she imagined was as the angels felt. Her experience stood arrayed against the positive command of Jehovah, yet Adam permitted himself to be seduced by it.",
