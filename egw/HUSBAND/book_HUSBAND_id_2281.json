He is not always in a condition of physical and spiritual health to make decisions in regard to such matters; and should they be brought before him, and he devote that thought, and study, and prayer to the subject which are required in order to give an answer according to the mind of God, he would be unable to stand under the burden. If others are to throw their burdens of anxiety, close thinking, and earnest prayer upon him, they will fail to gain that deep, living experience which they might otherwise obtain in carrying forward the work. He should not feel that he is responsible for all their planning and executing. And if my husband gives hasty decisions, without taking in all the bearings of the question before him, he is liable to make mistakes, and to mar the cause of God. When my husband is known to have sufficient physical and mental health for counsel and advice, then the large plans devised by others may be laid before him. The long experience he has had, and the light God has given me, may be of great service to the cause of God, when important decisions are to be made. \n                                                                           30",
