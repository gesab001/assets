    "word": "\"I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman. Every branch in Me. . . that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit . . . . Abide in Me, and I in you.

I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing. . . . Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples\" (John 15:1-8). Can you, my brother, claim the right of discipleship? Are your fruits unto holiness?",
