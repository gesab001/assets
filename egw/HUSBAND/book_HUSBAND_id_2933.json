    "word": "November 20, one week ago, Brother Henry Nichols and self went to Topsham. We had just risen from the dinner table Thursday [Nov. 21], when one of Brother Foey's children came in and said their mother was insensible. We hastened over the river one mile and found our dear Sister Foey dying. My distress was great as I found she did not know me. She continued long in great distress until between three and four o'clock and then breathed her last. She has left a husband and three children to mourn their loss. \n\n\n                                   -208-",
