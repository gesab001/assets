    "word": "Walk not in the shadow of the cross. Do not give expression to weeping, lamentation and woe; but encourage your soul to hope and joy. The cross points upwards to a living Saviour, who is your advocate, and is pleading in your behalf. I remember that my husband used to sometimes halt in the shadow of the cross, and he could see nothing but the dark side. He was sorely tried and perplexed. He suffered being tempted. So sorely were we tried that I thought death would be preferable to the sufferings we endured. Clouds surrounded us, and everything was unfavorable to the light, hope, and courage of the soul. We are in the same danger now of not discerning the light that shines from the cross of Calvary. We have been halting in the shadow of the cross of Calvary. At times we have failed to gather about us the warm bright rays which come to us from an uplifted Saviour.",
