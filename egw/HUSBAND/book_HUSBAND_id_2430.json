    "word": "Bro. Smith has a most precious gift that Satan would have buried. He can write, and he can preach the truth with acceptance, \n                                                                           47\nand he should not excuse himself, but, in confidence and faith, move forward, and God will sustain him. Bro. Smith can fill an important position in the cause and work of God. He should be guarded, and not allow influence to discourage and depress him. Home influences have confused his faith, and clouded his discernment, and had a tendency to disqualify him to judge who was really deserving of his sympathies. He could not see but that those whom God could not approve and bless, and upon whom rested his frown, were about as near right as those whom God was especially leading, and giving testimonies of reproof and warning. This has been a great discouragement to my husband.",
