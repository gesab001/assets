    "word": "120\n  \nVISIT TO BROTHER SNOW\n \n     From Volhey we journeyed toward Port Gibson, sixty miles distant, to meet another appointment August 27 and 28. \"On our way,\" wrote my husband in a letter to Brother Hastings dated August 26, \"we stopped at Brother Snow's in Hannibal. In that place are eight or ten precious souls. Brother Bates, Brother and Sister Edson, and Brother Simmons stopped all night with them. In the morning Ellen was taken off in vision, and while she was in vision, all the brethren came in. One of the number was not with us on the Sabbath [truth], but was humble and good. Ellen rose up in vision, took the large Bible, held it up before the Lord, talked from it, then carried it to this humble brother, and put it in his arms. He took it while tears were rolling down his bosom. Then Ellen came and sat down by me. She was in vision one and a half hours, in which time she did not breathe at all. It was an affecting time. All wept much for joy. We left Brother Bates with them, and came to this place with Brother Edson.\"",
