    "word": "George [Amadon?] and self have written Brother C. as comforting a letter as we could under the circumstances. We shall make up a box and send to the family the things sent in for the poor. It will do them much good this winter. I shall write to Convis to help and to Bro. Byington's family and we can make out a box, I think, worthy of sending. We have stockings and socks which will be of good service to them and unless they have them, will not be used this winter. I shall send a bed quilt that has been handed in for the poor.--Letter 12, 1860, p. 1. (To \"Dear Husband,\" October 28, 1860.)",
