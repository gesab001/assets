    "word": "I know what I am talking about, for my husband's brother, Nathaniel White, died of consumption in my home, also Sister Annie White, and [Luman V. Masten] the foreman of our printing office in Rochester, New York. I could not bring on these the painful experience of being separated from their family, and placed in a home with a large number of consumptives. I placed them where they would be comfortable, and where they could receive the attention of their friends to the last. Every precaution can be taken when one in a family is afflicted with this disease, and his friends can give him loving attention and watchcare. But separate him from his home, and he is painfully conscious of the cause. And the sight of the sick and the dying around him hastens his life to its close.",
