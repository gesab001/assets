    "word": "Grand Lake, Colorado, Monday, September 29, 1873. We improved a portion of the day in getting hay for horses. My husband swung the scythe. Willie pitched the hay into the wagon and Lucinda and I trod it down. My husband and Willie worked diligently to make a warm stable of an old house nearby, and in securing hay for horses. My husband is encouraged in regard to his health. He can endure considerable physical exercise. His food does not distress him as it did.",
