    "word": "My sister, you and your mother should do all in your power to please your husband. Remember that he is a nervous dyspeptic. I hope you may never know what a nervous dyspeptic has to endure. Do everything you can to restore your husband to health. In no case withhold your sympathy, but encourage him in every way possible. Give up your own ideas and your own wishes if by so doing you can help him. Thus you will be blessed. Do not persist in having your own way when you know that this afflicts him.",
