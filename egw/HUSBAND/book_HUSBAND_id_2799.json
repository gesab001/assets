    "word": "Humboldt, Wyoming County, Nevada, Wednesday, July 28, 1880--Dear Children: It is not yet two days since we left you and it seems one week. We have had a pleasant and comfortable time thus far. The train stopped six hours at Rockwell. We went out in search of our people. We were made welcome at Sister Prosser's. Her husband is not a believer but he gave us a hearty welcome. We took dinner with them. Was sorry I was not in a better visiting order, for I was so worn visiting was a tax. We prayed with them about two o'clock and then went to the train only a few rods from their house. We have not yet put up our bed. We, Sister Hall and myself, lie down and sleep much of the time. The more I sleep the more I want to sleep. I am not worth much.",
