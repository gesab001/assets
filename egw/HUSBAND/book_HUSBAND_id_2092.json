    "word": "When man fell, God commenced to work to defeat the plans of Satan. God works in man. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). In the beginning the Lord enjoined upon man the cultivation of the earth. This work was made much harder because of the transgression of the law of God. By transgressing, man worked against his own present and eternal good. The earth was cursed because through disobedience man gave Satan opportunity to sow in the human heart the seeds of evil. The ground that in the beginning produced only good began to produce tares, and their growth called for continual warfare.",
