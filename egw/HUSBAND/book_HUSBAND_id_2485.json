    "word": "After my husband's first sickness, there was a change in the order of things, not pleasing to God. In place of seeking to carry out the directions given of God, a selfish, unchristlike spirit prevailed. The cloud of the Lord's displeasure was gathering over the office. The people of God were becoming discouraged. They had denied themselves to pay their tithes, and refused themselves conveniences which they thought they must have; but the wants of the cause were dearer to them than self-indulgence, and they were much blessed in making their freewill offering. But when they saw that men in the office were grasping for higher wages, their confidence was shaken. Did the Lord require so much more of them than of those closely connected with the office? \n                                                                           268",
