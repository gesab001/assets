    "word": "July third we left Greenville in company with Brother Smith, to visit Wright. My husband spoke Sabbath forenoon, with freedom. He stated that while the world at large was celebrating our national independence a few of us were observing an institution as old as the world, the rest day of Jehovah. My husband spoke upon the importance of keeping the very day of the week upon which God rested if we would observe the true memorial of His rest, as the people of the country were observing the fourth of July in commemoration of the independence of the people.",
