    "word": "In our early experiences the Lord gave us favor with the people, and we had many wonderful opportunities to demonstrate what could be done through the principles of health reform to restore to health those whose cases had been pronounced hopeless. At one time the wife of the high school teacher in Battle Creek was thrown from a sleigh and seriously injured. We took her into our house, which was close by, and cared for her. The doctor called, and when he saw what we were doing, he said, \"You are doing the very best that can be done. I leave the case with you.\" She recovered. Some years afterward she came to my house, bringing her husband and her little girl. She said to the child, \"This is Mrs. White. You would not be here today if she had not saved my life several years ago.\" We knelt down together and thanked the Lord for His mercy.",
