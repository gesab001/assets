    "word": "In the mountains, Colorado, Tuesday, September 23, 1873. We rose early and packed up bedding and provisions for a start on our journey, after committing our case to God for His protection and guarding care. The road was so rough for about six miles, Sister Hall and myself decided to walk. My husband rode a pony. Willie walked. Brother Glover drove the horses. The road was very rough. We had to walk over streams and gulches, on stones and upon logs. We gathered some gum from the trees as we passed along.",
