    "word": "Grand Lake, Colorado, Tuesday, September 30, 1873. Another beautiful, sunshiny day. We have the men who took fish to Central and Black Hawk. They have again come with supplies and to get more fish. My husband and Willie talked with them considerably. Mr. Westcott killed a wolf this morning. It was a large, savage-looking beast. He was caught in a trap and was howling half the night, which seemed very dismal. The fur of the wolf was very fine and thick.--Ms 11, 1873. \n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nSeptember 14, 1989. Entire Ms.",
