    "word": "Woman, if she wisely improves her time and her faculties, relying upon God for wisdom and strength, may stand on an equality with\n152\nher husband as adviser, counselor, companion, and coworker, and yet lose none of her womanly grace or modesty. She may elevate her own character, and just as she does this she is elevating and ennobling the characters of her family and exerting a powerful though unconscious influence upon others around her.--HR, June 1, 1880.",
