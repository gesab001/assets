    "word": "Since writing the above, Lilly Belden Gilbert has arrived with her husband and two children. Lilly has taken a decided stand for the truth, and her husband opposes and threatens, yet she holds the faith firmly and says she will not give it up. I have just spoken with her. She is glad to see me. Father Belden is here. His son-in-law, Hull, and his wife have come into the truth. They are here on the ground. I dare not visit with them tonight, for I must speak tonight and must not become too weary. Again good-bye and good-night.--Letter 66, 1887. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nApril 18, 1991. Entire Letter.",
