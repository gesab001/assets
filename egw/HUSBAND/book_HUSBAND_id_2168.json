    "word": "Often I said to my husband while he was with me, \"If only I could have the assurance beforehand, how much good it would do me.\" He would answer, \"God has never failed to bless you the moment you rise to speak; so whatever may be your feelings, you must put your trust in Him, hanging your helpless soul on His promises.\" This I have tried to do. I have learned that we must act our part, cooperating with God. He gives strength for every duty.--Ms 111, 1901.",
