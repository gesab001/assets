    "word": "When I have heard a wife mourning that her husband did not show her all the affection she thought he should, I have sent a silent petition to God that this soul might be refreshed with the Word. From the light God had given me. I knew that she needed to drink deep of the cool waters of Lebanon \n\n\n                                  -307- \n\ninstead of the turbid streams of the valley. When women will feed upon the words of Christ, when their thirsty souls shall drink of the water of life, they will have far less sentimentalism, and far greater spirituality. They will purify their souls by obeying the truth.",
