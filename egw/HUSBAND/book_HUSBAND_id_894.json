    "word": "God is fitting up men to bear burdens, to plan and  execute, and my husband must not stand in the way. He cannot encircle the cause of God in his arms; it is too broad. Many heads and many hands are needed to plan and labor, not saving themselves. For want of experience, mistakes will be made; but if the workers connect with God, He will give them an increase of wisdom. Never since the creation of the world were such important interests at stake as now depend upon the action of men who believe and are giving the last message of warning to the world.",
