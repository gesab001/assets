    "word": "Sister Bourdeau has been a laborer of no little influence, meek, cheerful, hopeful, and patient, a treasure of greater value than finest gold. She is needed with her husband. Some have envied her what they thought was an easy position. They have liberty to enter the field as workers. They have the privilege of becoming missionaries for God and testing the easy work of laboring for souls. We need more workers, earnest workers. But those who have so little idea of the real nature of the work as to think it a position of ease to labor in hard fields among those whose hearts are as hard as steel, show that they have not any sense of the real work for this time.",
