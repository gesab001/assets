    "word": "The painful experience we had in Rochester while our brethren neglected to share our burdens was marked of God. At this time, Bro. Andrews was on the wrong side. Instead of lifting the burdens where they most needed to be lifted, he was with the murmurers and the jealous ones. He occupied a position where, if his course was questioned by my husband, he felt aggrieved, and the impression he gave to others by his words and deportment led them to settle in their minds that my husband and myself were wrong. Brn. Orton and Lamson did not receive the correct impression; and a large circle connected with these thought Bro. White was severe and overbearing, and they felt justified to array themselves against us, because so good a man as Bro. Andrews was abused by Bro. White. The carrying out of their peculiar feelings of sympathy, led them to unite in blinding the eyes of Luman Masten to his own case. They daubed him with untempered mortar, crying, Peace, peace, to the dying man going down into the grave with his sins unconfessed. This unsanctified sympathy has proved the ruin of thousands. \n                                                                           73",
