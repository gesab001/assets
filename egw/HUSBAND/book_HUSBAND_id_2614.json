    "word": "A very influential man has seen notice of the Health Institute in a Chicago paper, and he came here yesterday. He is a health reformer and has eaten but one meal a day for ten years. He is a healthy-looking man and wishes to become acquainted with my husband and myself. He will spend Sabbath and first day here. He has felt no union with Dr. Trall or Fowler, because he saw that they were leaning toward infidelity. --Letter 61, 1874. (To Brother Littlejohn, November 11, 1874.)",
