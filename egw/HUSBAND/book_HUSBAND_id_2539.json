    "word": "Dear Husband and Children Three:  We hope you will be cheerful and happy while you are in the mountains. This precious opportunity of being all together as you now are may never come to you again. . . . Lay aside your work, let the writings go. Go over into the park and see all that you can. Get all the pleasure you can out of this little season. I sometimes fear we do not appreciate these precious opportunities and privileges until they pass, and it is too late. . . .",
