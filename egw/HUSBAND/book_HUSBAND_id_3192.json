    "word": "I was instructed that as the Lord had led my husband and my self and the many other helping hands to sacrifice in order to establish the Battle Creek Sanitarium, so it was the Lord's purpose for the managers of the long established and prosperous medical institution at the heart of the work to help to establish other medical institutions in destitute fields even if doing this led them to limit their expenditure for their own convenience. They should have been anxious and glad to see a memorial established in Australia for this was God's will concerning them. But they did not heed the invitation. The work that they might have done, they did not do. Dr. Kellogg and his brother made personal gifts; but this was not fulfilling the Lord's requirement. Certain ideas prevailed that were not inspired of God. Certain things were done that brought great discouragement to our work and workers in Australia, binding about and greatly hindering the work that the Lord specified should be done. Had the Doctor and his associates heeded the word of God at this time, the medical work in Australia would be years in advance of what it now is.",
