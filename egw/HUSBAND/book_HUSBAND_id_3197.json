    "word": "I remember that when I was in Oakland there was a sister who was in great trouble. She said, \"My mother troubles me. My father is a good man; but my mother has her eyes fixed on so many young couples where the husband is disloyal that she seems to think her husband and everyone else is disloyal. I do not know what she will do or drive him to. She thinks he is unfaithful, and she talks of it and dwells upon it till she brings all her misery on the rest of us, as though she were imposed upon, when there is no need of it at all.\"",
