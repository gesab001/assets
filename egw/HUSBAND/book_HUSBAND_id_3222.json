    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., Wednesday, December 31, 1890 \n\n     I devoted much time to writing for Brother Smith, but did not feel quite free to send it to him. Held it, to decide whether I had better talk with him. If Brother Uriah Smith would discern things in their true light he would not consent to things that are now being transacted. Brother Smith was with us in the rise of this work. He understands how we--my husband and myself--have carried the work forward and upward step by step, and have borne the hardships, the poverty, and the want of means. With us were those early workers. Elder Smith, especially, was one with my husband in his early manhood. He knows how we were pressed about for want of means--that our diet was of a very meager sort. Turnips were used for potatoes, because potatoes were too costly to come upon our table. We worked without wages, only using the means positively necessary to live, and our furniture was composed of such things as bottomless chairs that had to be reseated--prepared for use with canvas seats. He knows that we all acted our part bravely, to accommodate ourselves to the situation uncomplainingly while in Rochester, New York, and at different places where we were located. We know how much it cost us to lay the foundation for the work to be advanced onward and upward in our publishing work to its present prosperity.",
