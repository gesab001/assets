This movement embraced the Battle Creek Reform Club, six hundred strong, and the W.C.T.U., two hundred and sixty strong. God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Bible were familiar words with these earnest workers. Much good had already \n\n\n                             -237- \n\nbeen accomplished, and the activity of the workers, the system by which they labored, and the spirit of their meetings, promised greater good in time to come. It was on the occasion of the visit of Barnum's great menagerie to this city on the 25th of June, that the ladies of the Women's Christian Temperance Union struck a telling blow for temperance and reform by organizing an immense temperance restaurant to accommodate the crowds of people who gathered in from the country to visit the menagerie, thus preventing them from visiting the saloons and groceries, where they would be exposed to temptation. The mammoth tent, capable of holding five thousand people, used by the Michigan Conference for campmeeting purposes, was tendered (416) for the occasion. Beneath this immense canvas temple were erected fifteen or twenty tables for the accommodation of guests.",
