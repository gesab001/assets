    "word": "The most marked and effectual evidence of the truth is revealed in the harmony which should exist among the Lord's builders, among His husbandry. We must all draw together. Our strength is in our unity. We are weak when we do not love one another, and when we love our own selves more than we love Jesus. Christ declares that the demonstration of this unity is the evidence to the world that God has sent His Son into the world. When all who love God and keep His commandments work unselfishly, each working to build up not merely that which is under his immediate supervision, regardless of his fellow-laborers who are tugging and toiling with very few facilities with which to do the work; when they, in harmonious love, in unity of heart and action, interestedly favor others as they themselves have been favored, they will reveal to our world the great principle of the love of Christ.",
