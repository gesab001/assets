    "word": "It is nearly one week now before the camp meeting commences. Next Thursday I shall have my tent upon the ground. . . . I cannot sleep nights. My heart is drawn out in prayer to God for a fitness for the work. He will hear; He will answer. I shall be imbued with His Spirit. I shall be strengthened by His might. I have not a doubt of it. Work! I need not cross the plains to find it. It is heaping up everywhere. The harvest is ripe for the sickle and so few laborers. I have no course to mark out for you, not even a suggestion to make. I leave you with your God. Seek His counsel and all will be well. You need have no fears that my judgment or ideas shall conflict with yours. God will teach us. Trust in Him. But my work must be here on the Coast till I get marching orders.--Letter 31, 1878, pp. 2, 4. (To \"Dear Husband,\" June 20, 1878.)",
