G. White \n                                              at the Bible School \n                                              February 7, 1890 \n\n\n     I have been thinking of the lesson that Christ gave to His disciples just prior to His entering the Garden of Gethsemane, knowing it would be His last opportunity to instruct His disciples before His crucifixion. He says to them, as he points to a vine--and the vine is something that the Jews greatly prized and respected and considered very beautiful--\"I am the true vine; my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit shall be taken away.\" Now, here is something for us to study. \"Taken away.\" We have our opportunities now to bear fruit; we have our opportunities now that we can reveal that we are fruit-bearing branches of the vine. And if we go on now in a careless and indifferent manner, then what will be our position? He tells us He will take us away, for we cannot do anything without Christ; and if we are as a dead branch and do not draw any sap and nourishment from the living vine, we shall become withered branches. He says every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it (pruneth it), that it may bring forth more fruit. Then He tells them that \"It is My Father's good pleasure that ye bring forth much fruit.\" Are we the branches of the living vine? Now, if we are, we are distinct; we are not all blended together; there are a number of branches, but we have one parent stock. If we are in Christ, and Christ is in us, will not our conversation, our words--everything we say--our deportment--everything we do--will it not have reference to Jesus Christ?",
