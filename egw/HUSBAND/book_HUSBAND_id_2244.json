    "word": "It is a matter of deep regret that the first managers of our Institute should take a course to nearly overwhelm it in debt and discouragement. But the financial losses which stockholders have felt, and have regretted, have been small in comparison to the labor, perplexity, and care which myself and husband have borne without pay, and which physicians and helpers have borne for small wages. We have taken stock in the Institute to the amount of $1500, which is \"assigned,\" which is a small consideration compared with the wear we have suffered in consequence of former reckless managers. But as the Institute now stands higher in reputation and patronage than ever before, and as the property is worth more than all the money that has been invested, and as former errors have been corrected, those who have lost their confidence have no excuse for cherishing feelings of prejudice. And if they still manifest a lack of interest it will be because they choose to cherish prejudice rather than to be led by reason.",
