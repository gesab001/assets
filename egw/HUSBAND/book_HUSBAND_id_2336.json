[THE \n     TESTIMONY, OF WHICH THE ABOVE PARAGRAPHS \n     ARE A PART, WAS READ IN JULY, 1881, BEFORE \n     THE LEADING MEMBERS OF THE BATTLE CREEK \n     CHURCH. IN THAT TESTIMONY THE SPIRIT OF \n     BITTERNESS MANIFESTED TOWARD MY HUSBAND BY \n     CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH WAS REPROVED, \n     AND THE RESULTS TO WHICH IT WOULD LEAD WERE \n     POINTED OUT. IT WAS A NEGLECT TO HEED THE \n     REPROOF THEN GIVEN THAT LED TO A REPETITION \n     OF THE SAME SIN.] \n\n\n     It pains me to say I have been shown that there are unruly tongues among the church members at Battle Creek. There are false tongues, that feed on mischief. There are sly, whispering tongues. There is tattling, impertinent meddling, adroit quizzing. Among the lovers of gossip, some are actuated by curiosity, others by jealousy, many by hatred against those through whom God has spoken to reprove them. All these discordant elements are at work. Some conceal their real sentiments, while others are eager to publish all they know, or even suspect, of evil against another.",
