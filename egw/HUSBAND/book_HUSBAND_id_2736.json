    "word": "We are a selfish set of beings. To those who are not related to us, the milk of human kindness is seldom given. There is abundance of overflowing love manifested to those who are related to us, but to others-- just as near and dear to the heart of Infinite Love--there is a coldness, uncourteousness, and selfish withholding of that love that flowed forth in such large measure to the special favorites and relatives.

God is not pleased with this favoritism. My husband is perfect, my children are perfect, and I myself am perfect. That is with many about the sum total of their religious experience--they act it out. \n\n\n                                      -57-",
