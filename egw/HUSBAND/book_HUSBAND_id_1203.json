    "word": "My husband died in 1881.  During the time that has passed since then, I have missed him constantly.  For one year after his death, I felt my loss keenly, until the Lord, when I was at the gates of death, healed me instantly.  This was at a camp meeting held at Healdsburg, about a year after my husband's death.  Since that time I have been willing to live, or willing to die, just as the Lord sees I can best glorify Him.  -- Letter 396, 1906.",
