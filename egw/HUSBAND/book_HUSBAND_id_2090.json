    "word": "Said Christ, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.\" \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" \"Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit\" (John 15:1, 5, 2). That unpruned branch may have looked good to human eyes but the eye of One who never slumbers nor sleeps leaves it not alone to die of discouragement. The Husbandman pruneth it, that it may produce fruit unto life eternal. . . .",
