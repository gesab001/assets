    "word": "Friday, March 31, 1876, Oakland, California, Ellen White to James White \n\n\n     Dear Husband: . . . I enjoy the presence of God and yet my soul is continually drawn out for more of His salvation. I am writing and having freedom in my writing. Precious subjects I am handling. The last I completed or about completed yesterday--Jesus healing the impotent man at the pool of Bethesda. It is a great subject, the discourse of Christ, following the healing as He was accused of the Jews of Sabbath breaking.--Letter 1, 1876, p. 2.",
