    "word": "A couple leave the boat at Samoa. The lady, Mrs. Goward, caught sight of Desire of Ages and she expressed her admiration of the book. I made her a present of it, and gave her the little book Christian Education. She said when she took it up she could not lay it down. She said she never saw things in print so enlightening and so beneficial. Her husband has been reading Desire of Ages. He says it is a wonderful book. Both seem very thankful for these books. Now they leave Samoa for another island. They think much of Dr. Braught and the islanders miss him very much.",
