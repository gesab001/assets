    "word": "(Colorado) Sunday, June 29, 1873--We all rested the few hours of the night after we retired. We were on our way about half past seven. We rode about three miles and stopped for breakfast. We purchased milk and had a very good breakfast. The scenery is very grand. Large mountains of rocks stretching toward heaven, tower one above another. My husband endured the journey well. We took dinner and enjoyed eating in the open air. My husband has been wonderfully preserved.--Ms. 8, 1873, pp. 9, 10. (Diary, June 25-29, 1873.)",
