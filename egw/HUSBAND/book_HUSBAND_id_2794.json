    "word": "Forgive me for any words of impatience that have escaped my lips, every seeming act of wrong in your sight. I mean to make straight paths for my feet and to have control over my own spirit, to keep my own heart in the love of God, and make sure work for eternity. Perils surround us; perplexities we must meet, and we cannot meet them aright unless we are fully consecrated to God and have self under the full control of His Spirit. May the Lord teach and lead and guide you is my prayer, and may nothing shake our hold on Him.--Letter 5, 1880, pp. 3-6. (Addressed to her husband, Elder James White, from Oakland, Calif. March 18, 1880.) \n\nWhite Estate, Wash. D. C. May 19, 1981",
