    "word": "\"My selfish sorrow nearly killed me, and crippled my husband in his labors. But the Lord had mercy upon us, and He let me see the selfishness of my heart. Now I am as one who has awakened out of a deep sleep. I am not in the world to amuse myself, to seek to be amused or petted, or to work for my own selfish interests. I am here to do my duty. I try to show that I respect and honor my husband by being interested in his work in the various lines of the cause of God. I no longer make myself miserable over things I cannot help, but try to adapt myself to circumstances. If the Lord sees fit to give me another child, I shall hold it, not as a plaything but as a sacred, entrusted charge; not as an idol, but [as] a soul that I am to train for the courts above.",
