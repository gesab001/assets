    "word": "In many families we hear very little affection expressed. The members of the family seem cold and alienated, and regard all manner of expressions of affection as sentimental. There is no need of sentimentalism, but there is need of thoughtful courtesy one toward another, of chaste, ennobling, dignified manifestations of regard. Many who profess to love God seem to pride themselves on their hardness of heart. In language and action they reveal a character that is an offense to God. The tenderest affection should be cherished in the family circle. Especially between the husband and the wife should thoughtful love and refined courtesy ever be manifested. Brothers and sisters should never act as though they did not love one another; they should learn to restrain hasty words and manifestations of impatience. Every member of the family should manifest kindly affection one for another.",
