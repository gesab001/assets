    "word": "Some years ago, while rowing on Lake Goguac [in Michigan] with my husband, we saw a beautiful lily, I asked my husband to get it for me, and to pluck it with as long a stem as he could. He did so, and I examined it. In the stem was a channel through which flowed the nourishment best suited to the development of the lily. This nourishment it took, refusing the vileness with which it was surrounded. It had a connection with the sand far below the surface, and from there drew the sustenance which caused it to develop . . . its loveliness.",
