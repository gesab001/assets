    "word": "This woman is a well-appearing lady, and has been a teacher in the Sunday schools for ten years. Her ministers said that they could not think of such a thing as losing her. \"Oh,\" said she, \"I can teach in the Sunday school just as I have done.\" Said he, \"That is just what I wish to speak to you about. The church is not willing for you to continue to teach if you keep the Sabbath.\" Her husband has not the moral courage to take his position, although he is fully convinced of the Sabbath question. He is just trembling under the cross. May the Lord give him strength and grace to be obedient to all of His commandments.",
