The vine was greatly admired by the Jews, and Jesus said to his disciples, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away.\" Here is a truth for us to study. \"Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away.\" We now have an opportunity to be fruit-bearing branches of the True Vine; but if we are careless and indifferent, what will be our condition?--We shall be fruitless; we shall be taken away. We can do nothing without Christ; we shall have no sap or nourishment except as we get it from the living Vine. No branch can bear fruit except through a connection with Christ.",
