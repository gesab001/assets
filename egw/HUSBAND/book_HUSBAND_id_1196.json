    "word": "Ellen White Chose Not to Remarry \n\n     Since twenty-one years ago when I was deprived of my husband by death, I have not had the slightest idea of ever marrying again.  Why?  Not because God forbade it.  No.  But to stand alone was the best for me, that no one should suffer with me in carrying forward my work entrusted to me of God.  And no one should have a right to influence me in any way in reference to my responsibility and my work in bearing my testimony of encouragement and reproof.",
