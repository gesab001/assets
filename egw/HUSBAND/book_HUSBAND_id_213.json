    "word": "HEALING OF GILBERT COLLINS\n \n     One morning in February, 1849, during family prayers at Brother Howland's, I was shown that it\n121\n122\nwas our duty to go to Dartmouth, Massachusetts. Soon after, my husband went to the post office, and brought a letter from Brother Philip Collins, urging us to come to Dartmouth, for their son was very sick. We went immediately, and found that the boy, who was thirteen years old, had been sick for nine weeks with the whooping cough, and was wasted almost to a skeleton. The parents thought him to be in consumption, and they were greatly distressed to think that their only son must be taken from them.",
