    "word": "I went into Oregon when my husband was stricken with paralysis, and bore my testimony, and the power of God rested upon me. Next year I went into Upper Columbia. There were all these men of wealth. Those who had the most were complaining the most. Here they were with all their complaints, when I stepped into the desk and asked what they were complaining about. I knew what they were complaining about, and said to Brother Miller, \"You invested so much money in the cause. What did you do after you pledged this much? You went and talked your disaffection, and God cut your crops down according to your withholding. According to this He has cut down your crops. We want to elevate this conference,\" said I, and turned around to Brother Van Horn, and told him to put my name down in place of Brother Miller's. \"I will stand where he stands. I will be responsible for him.\" I called for another in the same way, and when I called for a third, they got ashamed and began to feel that they would not allow Sister White to pay their money.",
