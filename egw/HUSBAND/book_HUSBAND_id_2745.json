    "word": "Now, Father, you are with your dear children. You may never have this privilege again. I repeat once more, Make the most of it. Do not think that so much writing is necessary. This will keep. Lay all such work aside. I know you will all please God much better by seeking to build up your strength, and laying in a good stock of vitality that you can draw upon in time of need. I should feel sad to see this precious opportunity spoiled by your doing unnecessary things in the line of writing.--Letter 1, 1878, pp. 2-4.(To \"Dear Husband and Children Three,\" Aug. 24, 1878.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. January 2, 1980",
