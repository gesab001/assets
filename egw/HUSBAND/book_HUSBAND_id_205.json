    "word": "FIRST VISIT TO CONNECTICUT\n\n     While at Topsham we received a letter from Brother E. L. H. Chamberlain, of Middletown, Connecticut, urging us to attend a conference in that State in April, 1848. We decided to go if we could obtain means. My husband settled with his employer, and found that there was ten dollars due him. With five of this I purchased articles of clothing that we very much needed, and then patched my husband's overcoat, even piecing the patches, making it difficult to tell the original cloth in the sleeves. We had five dollars left to take us to Dorchester, Massachusetts.",
