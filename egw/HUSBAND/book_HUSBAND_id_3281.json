    "word": "We had to work wonderfully hard before our institutions were established. We went from place to place giving treatments. \n\n\n                              -539- \n\nThere are a great many who cannot go to the sanitariums, but we may go right in where they are and see the sick and tell them how to treat themselves. That is the way my husband and I would do, and we took them right into our house, he would take the men and I the women and work that way. What is Satan doing? He links himself with every discordant spirit in the world. Satan and his vast, vast, numbers who are disobedient to the heavenly commands, and they will represent these things that are of great importance and give all to understand that they know all about it and that they can do thus and so. We are not building up what we should outside of our churches, and this is the very work the Lord wants carried forward. We have every endowment and capability and every facility provided for discharging the duties that devolve upon us. We should be grateful to God for these advantages.",
