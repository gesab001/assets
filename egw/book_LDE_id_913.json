Now, in their despair, these teachers confess before the world their work of deception. The multitudes are filled with fury. \"We are lost!\" they cry, \"and you are the cause of our ruin\"; and they turn upon the false shepherds. The very ones that once admired them most, will pronounce the most dreadful curses upon them. The very hands that once crowned them with laurels, will be raised for their destruction. The swords which were to slay God's people, are now employed to destroy their enemies.--GC 655, 656 (1911).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 247}
