{"word": "The Sabbath question is to be the issue in the great final conflict in which all the world will act a part. Men and women have honored Satan\\92s principles above the principles that rule in the heavens. They have accepted the spurious sabbath, which Satan has exalted as the sign of his authority. But God has set His seal upon His royal requirement. Each sabbath institution [both true and false] bears the name of its author, an ineffaceable mark that shows the authority of each. It is our work to lead the people to understand this. We are to show them that it is of vital consequence whether they bear the mark of God\\92s kingdom or the mark of the kingdom of rebellion, for they acknowledge themselves subjects of the kingdom whose mark they bear. God has called us to uplift the standard of His downtrodden Sabbath. How important, then, that our example in Sabbathkeeping should be right.\\97Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, pp. 351-353.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 141}
