{"word": "The test will come, not as regards the outward complexion, but as regards the condition of the heart. Both the white and the colored people have the same Redeemer, who has paid the ransom money with His own life for every member of the human family. If those to whom Christ first sends His invitation to the marriage supper refuse to receive the message, He will send His messengers into the highways and hedges to compel the people to come in, by means of a message so full of the light of Heaven that they will not dare to refuse. The gospel was first to be brought to those to whom God had entrusted precious truths that He desired they should make known to others. He entrusted to them the responsibility of imparting the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom He had sent. The Lord wrought wondrously for the children of Israel.

The disciples of Christ were commissioned to proclaim the message of mercy to those in the highways and the byways of the Lord's great moral vineyard. \"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.
