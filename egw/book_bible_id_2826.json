{"word": "14: Time Management\n \n\n     Success or failure in ministry depends much on one's use of time.--Some might now have been thorough workmen had they made a good use of their time, feeling that they would have to give an account to God for their misspent moments. They have displeased God because they have not been industrious. Self-gratification, self-love, and selfish love of ease have kept some from good, withheld them from obtaining a knowledge of the Scriptures that they might be thoroughly furnished unto all good works. Some do not appreciate the value of time and have idled away in bed the hours that might have been employed in the study of the Bible.--2T 499.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 81}
