    "word": "An Ever-Widening Work \n\n     God's servants are to make use of every resource for enlarging His kingdom. The apostle Paul declares that \n                                                                           15\nit is \"good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth,\" that \"supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men.\" 1 Timothy 2:3,4,1. And James says: \"Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.\" James 5:20. Every believer is pledged to unite with his brethren in giving the invitation, \"Come; for all things are now ready.\" Luke 14:17. Each is to encourage the others in doing wholehearted work. Earnest invitations will be given by a living church. Thirsty souls will be led to the water of life.",
