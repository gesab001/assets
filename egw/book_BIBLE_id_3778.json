{"word": "Not to Be Deterred by Ridicule.--Our ministers should become intelligent upon this question. They should not ignore it, nor be turned aside by those who call them extremists. Let them find out what constitutes true health reform, and teach its principles, both by precept and by a quiet, consistent example. At our large gatherings, instruction should be given upon health and temperance. Seek to arouse the intellect and the conscience. Bring into service all the talent at command, and follow up the work with publications upon the subject. \"Educate, educate, educate,\" is the message that has been impressed upon me.--Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, page 117.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 245}
