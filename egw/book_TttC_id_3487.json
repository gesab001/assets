    "word": "Balaam inquired of God if he might curse Israel, because in so doing he had the promise of great reward. And God said, \"Thou shalt not go;\" but he was urged by the messengers, and greater inducements were presented. Balaam had been shown the will of the Lord in this matter, but he was so eager for the reward that he ventured to ask God the second time. The Lord permitted Balaam to go. Then he had a wonderful experience, but who would wish to be guided by such an experience? There are those who would understand their duty clearly if it were in harmony with their natural inclinations. Circumstances and reason may clearly indicate their duty; but when against their natural inclination, these evidences are frequently set aside. Then these persons will presume to go to God to learn their duty. But God will not be trifled with. He will permit such persons to follow the desires of their own hearts. Psalm 81:11, 12: \"But My people would not hearken to My voice.\" \"So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.\"",
