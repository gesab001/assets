    "word": "Sands (Stanley), Virginia, Wednesday, November 5, 1890 \n\n     On the cars we met Brother Lawhead and his son. We were passing over the same ground that we went over two years ago in journeying to Williamsport at the time of the flood. We changed cars at Elmira and at Williamsport, and then we journeyed to Harrisburg. We tarried there until the next morning. We walked to the hotel from the depot--a few blocks--and we found crowds everywhere yelling at the top of their voices because it was election of the State officers and governor of the State. We did not return until eleven o'clock at night. The noise and shouting kept up all night. We had to be at the train at half-past four o'clock. We were called at a quarter before four, giving us three-quarters of an hour to dress and to be at the depot, check baggage, and buy tickets.",
