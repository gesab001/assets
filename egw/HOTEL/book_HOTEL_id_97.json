Could get no one to go with me and Father, and I went alone. I had not been able to eat anything from Sunday noon until Tuesday noon and then only a very little. The journey on Grand Trunk was much easier than anticipated. We arrived at Montreal about eleven o'clock, stopped at a hotel that night. Next day at about noon arrived at Sherbrook. We here took the stage for Magog, sixteen miles. Oh, what a barren rocky country. Poverty, poverty reigning everywhere. We reached the campground about two hours before sundown.",
