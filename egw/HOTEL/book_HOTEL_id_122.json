    "word": "After I ceased speaking, ladies and gentlemen came to the tent saying they did not get here till I was about done and wished to know if I would speak upon the ground again. We told them I would speak Monday afternoon. But after this a hotel keeper in the village made a request for me to speak in the Methodist church Monday evening. He obtained the consent of ministers and trustees. All were unanimous and urgent. I assented. So I spoke this morning, Monday, then in the evening in the Methodist church. No Adventist has been able to get a hearing heretofore in that church. My prayer is that this effort may tell to the glory of God in the advancement of His truth.",
