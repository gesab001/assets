    "word": "January 31 \n\n     Yesterday some of the company who have been entertained at our house made their departure. Brother Colcord, W. C. White and Sister Bree who has been attending school in Melbourne, all departed for New Zealand. Brother Lawrence, Brother Sisley, and Brother Rousseau leave today for Dora Creek. Doctor Kellogg and Sister Rousseau are still here. We shall keep a free hotel as long as we are living in Granville; for there is no other way to do. We shall have to have council meetings and committee meetings at our home, and those who come to these meetings must be entertained at our house and sit at our table. We like to have them here, but it is almost a constant draft upon us.",
