    "word": "About 8 p.m. we reached Cologne, or \u201cKoln,\u201d as the Germans spell it and pronounce it. Here we spent the night. Our hotel was but a short distance from the celebrated cathedral, and we had a good view of it by moonlight. This is said to be the most magnificent Gothic edifice in the world. It is built, as cathedrals usually are, in the form of a cross, is 444 feet long, and has two towers each 512 feet high, the loftiest in Europe. The building is covered with turrets and statuary, and presents a most imposing appearance. It was more than six hundred years in building, and the names of the first architects have long since been forgotten. In 1848 was celebrated the six-hundredth anniversary of the laying of the corner-stone. The cathedral was completed in 1880, at an estimated cost of $10,000,000.",
