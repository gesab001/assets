    "word": "At the Jewel Hotel in Wyoming, about three o'clock: We are disappointed in getting through tonight. We learned about one hour since that there were several breaks in the road and no means of transfer. One washout is forty rods long. We have secured a room in a hotel until tomorrow at eleven o'clock when we shall, if Providence favors, go on to the camp meeting. We deeply regret this delay, but make it a point to be surprised at nothing that may occur and not to become impatient or faultfinding. This place presents a very attractive appearance and the surrounding scenery is lovely. There are low bluffs covered with trees and verdure.--Letter 19a, 1875, pp. 3-4. (To Edson and Emma White, June 24, 1875.) \n\n\n                                     -134-",
