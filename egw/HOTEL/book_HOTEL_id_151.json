    "word": "Our sanitariums should never be conducted after the fashion of a hotel, I am very sorry that it is such a difficult matter for you to deny your appetite and reform your habits of eating and drinking. A meat diet changes the disposition, and strengthens the animalism. We are composed of what we eat, and eating much flesh will diminish intellectual activity. Students would accomplish much more in their studies if they never tasted meat. When the animal part of the human agent is strengthened by meat-eating, the intellectual diminish proportionately. A religious life can be more successfully gained and maintained if meat is discarded; for this diet stimulates into intense activity lustful propensities and enfeebles the moral and spiritual nature. The flesh warreth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. We need to greatly encourage and cultivate pure, chaste thoughts and to strengthen the moral powers, rather than the lower and carnal powers. God help us to wake from our self-indulgent appetites.",
