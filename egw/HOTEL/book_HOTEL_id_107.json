    "word": "(En route to Battle Creek) Friday, November 7, 1873--We had a portion of night's rest. The Legislature sits in Cheyenne, which fills the hotels. No room for us to have a bed until two o'clock; then some beds were vacated. We had a good rest when he did retire. My husband felt his mind turned to \n\n\n                                   -125- \n\nBattle Creek. We consulted together and decided to go to Battle Creek and send Sister Hall on with the little children. To this she agreed cheerfully. We arranged our trunks and parted, Sister Hall going to California and we turning our course to Battle Creek.--Ms. 13, 1873, p. 1. (Diary, Nov. 6, 7, 1873.)",
