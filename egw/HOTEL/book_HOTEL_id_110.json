    "word": "From Omaha to Kansas City, 1876--Dear Children, Willie and Mary: We arrived at Omaha about 3:30 p.m. We were immediately put on the sleeping car for Kansas City. Had good accommodations; rested well until four. We were then obliged to leave the train. We are waiting at a hotel close by depot to take the train at ten o'clock for nearest station to Melvern, which is Barbondale Avenue. We know not how far the station will leave us from the campground, but we may find definite directions there. We have endured the journey well. I have a headache this morning, but this is nothing strange, being on the road so long. I have eaten the first warm meal this morning. Mary has eaten twice on the road. We have not taken the nearest \n\n\n                                  -137- \n\nroute, but the best we could take, because tickets were not sold through. Others came the same route we have taken because it was the best and cheapest, so we have come the best way. I thought you would be relieved to hear this. We will write you as soon as we can after we get on the ground. We will not write much more now, but will get off another today.--Letter 29, 1876, p. 1. (To Willie and Mary White, May 25, 1876.)",
