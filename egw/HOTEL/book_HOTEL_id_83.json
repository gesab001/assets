    "word": "As one after another of the brethren have been removed by death, Bro. Andrews has been left almost alone, with more and greater care. All these things should have been convincing to Bro. Andrews in regard to his duty. But that which should have told with the greatest weight of all was, the fact that the Office of publication was removed because of unfaithfulness of those who should have felt the deepest interest in the cause and work of God. This company who bound themselves together by cords of unsanctified sympathy would not receive reproof and counsel. The straight testimony was irksome to them. And they determined to separate themselves from us, and they left Rochester. Rochester was a central place, and the house of Bro. Andrews has been like a hotel. If Bro. Andrews had exercised his reason, and if his judgment had been unbiased, he could have seen before this that he had made a mistake.",
