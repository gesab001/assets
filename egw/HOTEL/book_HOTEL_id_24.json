We asked for breakfast at six, but were told that it would be impossible to furnish anything so early. By previous experience we had learned that usually at this hour the fires were not built, nor were the doors unlocked. So, to carry out our plan, we purchased bread, fruit, and milk in the evening, and asked for dishes to be brought to our rooms that we might prepare our own breakfast. The porter was [told] to get up early and have the door unlocked at half past six; but this he failed to do until wakened by us in the morning. After this experience, we concluded that in order to enjoy traveling in Europe it is better to conform to the customs of the country than to try to introduce our own. We could have taken a later train, but thought that the early one would be less crowded and more pleasant.",
