    "word": "This property is now in our possession. It cost the company from whom we purchased it about $140,000.00. They erected the buildings, and ran the place for a time as a sanitarium. Then they tried to operate it as a tourist hotel. But this plan did not succeed, and they decided to sell. It was closed last April, and as the stockholders became more anxious to sell, it was offered to us for $40,000.00, and for this amount our brethren have purchased it.",
