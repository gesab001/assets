    "word": "Visit to Brother Abbey's--Brookfield \n\n     The next day we resumed our journey by packet, and went as far as Madison Co., N.Y. We then left the packet, hired a carriage, and rode twenty-five miles to Brookfield, where was the home of Brother Ira Abbey. As it was Friday afternoon when we arrived at the house, it was proposed that one should go to the door and make inquiries, so that should we be disappointed in our hope of a welcome, we might return with the driver, and put up at a hotel over the Sabbath.",
