    "word": "\"Learn of Me,\" said Christ; \"for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" He will instruct those who come to Him for knowledge. There are multitudes of false teachers in the world. The apostle declares that in the last days men will \"heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears,\" because they desire to hear smooth things. Against these Christ has warned us: \"Beware of false prophets, which \n                                                                           377\ncome to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits.\" The class of religious teachers here described profess to be Christians. They have the form of godliness and appear to be laboring for the good of souls, while they are at heart avaricious, selfish, ease-loving, following the promptings of their own unconsecrated hearts. They are in conflict with Christ and His teachings, and are destitute of His meek and lowly spirit.",
