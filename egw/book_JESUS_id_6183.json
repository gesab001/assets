{"word": "RANSOMED HOST CHRIST\\92S CHIEF GLORY.\\97In the intercessory prayer of Jesus with His Father, He claimed that He had fulfilled the conditions which made it obligatory upon the Father to fulfill His part of the contract made in heaven, with regard to fallen man. . . . He declares Himselfglorified in those who believe on Him. The church, in His name, is to carry to glorious perfection the work which He has commenced; and when that church shall be finally ransomed in the Paradise of God, He will look upon the travail of His soul and be satisfied. Through all eternity the ransomed host will be His chief glory.\\973SP 260, 261 quoted in SD 296.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 73}
