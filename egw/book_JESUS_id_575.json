{"word": "Chap. Fifty-Two - Choosing the School\n\n     We Sustain Terrible Losses.--At times I find myself wishing that God would speak to parents with an audible voice as He spoke to the wife of Manoah, telling them what they must do in training their children. We are sustaining terrible losses in every branch of the work through the neglect of home training. It was this that impressed upon our minds the need of schools where a religious influence should predominate. If anything can be done to counteract the great evil, in the strength of Jesus we will do it.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 303}
