    "word": "These examples of human steadfastness, in the might of divine power, are a witness to the world of the faithfulness of God's promises--of His abiding presence and sustaining grace. As the world looks upon these humble men, it cannot discern their moral value with God. It is a work of faith to calmly repose in God in the darkest hour-- however severely tried and tempest-tossed, to feel that our Father is at the helm. The eye of faith alone can look beyond the things of time and sense to estimate the worth of eternal riches. \n                                                                           526",
