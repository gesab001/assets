{"word": "Thursday we took the cars for London. Here we had the pleasure of meeting Eld. W. M. Jones, editor and publisher of the Sabbath Memorial, and pastor of an S. D. Baptist church in London, where he has for many years stood in defense of the Bible Sabbath. We appreciated his kindness in accompanying us to the British Museum, and in explaining to us many things of interest. It would have been pleasant and profitable to spend considerable time among these interesting relics; but we were obliged to be content with only a few hours here in order that we might meet appointments at Southampton.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 163}
