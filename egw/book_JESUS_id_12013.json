{"word": "The tempter's voice will be heard on every side, telling you that you are not now required to keep the law of God. This is a device of Satan. God has a law, and men must keep it. If they disregard these rules, they will not have that perfection of character . . . required to become members of the royal family . . . for God wrote these ten holy rules on tables of stone and kept them in the ark of God's testimony. The cover of this ark . . . was called the mercy-seat, to signify that although death was the penalty for transgressing the law, mercy came through Jesus Christ to pardon the repentant, believing sinner.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 66}
