    "word": "To protect the people of God from the corrupting influence of the world, as well as to promote physical and moral health, the dress reform was introduced among us.

It would distinguish God's people from the world, and thus serve as a barrier against its fashions and follies. He who knows the end from the beginning, who understands our nature and our needs,--our compassionate Redeemer,--saw our dangers and difficulties, and condescended to give us timely warning and instruction concerning our habits of life, even in the proper selection of food and clothing.",
