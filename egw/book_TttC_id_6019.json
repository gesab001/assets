    "word": "The precious book of God contains rules of life for men of every class and every vocation. Examples are here found which it would be well for all to study and imitate. \"The Son of God came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\" The true honor and glory of the servant of Christ consists, not in the number of sermons preached, nor in the amount of writing accomplished, but in the work of faithfully ministering to the wants of the people. If he neglects this part of his work he has no right to the name of minister.",
