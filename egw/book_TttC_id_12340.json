    "word": "There are many souls to be brought to the saving knowledge of the truth. The prodigal is far from his Father's house, perishing with hunger. He is to be the object of our compassion. Do you ask: \"How does God regard those who are perishing in their sins?\" I point you to Calvary. God \"gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16. Think of the Saviour's matchless love. While we were yet sinners, Christ died to save us from eternal death. In return for the great love wherewith Christ has loved you, you are to bring to Him your thank offering. You are to make a gratitude offering of yourself. Your time, your talents, your means--all are to flow to the world in a tide of love for the saving of the lost. Jesus has made it possible for you to accept His love and in happy co-operation with Him to work under its fragrant influence. He requires you to use your possessions in unselfish service, that His plan for the salvation of souls shall be carried forward with power. He expects you to give your undivided energies to His work.",
