{"word": "Increasing Difficulties \n\n     Advance With Increasing Effort.--We are nearing the great and final conflict. Every advance move made now must be made with increasing effort; for Satan is working with all power to increase the difficulties in our way. He works with all deceivableness of unrighteousness to secure the souls of men. I am charged to say to ministers of the gospel and to our missionary physicians, Go forward. The work to be done calls for self-sacrifice at every step, but go forward.--Letter 38, 1908.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 30}
