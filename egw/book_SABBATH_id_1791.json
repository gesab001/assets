Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: \n                                                                           257\nwhosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed\" (verses 14-17).-- Manuscript 122, 1901.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 256}
