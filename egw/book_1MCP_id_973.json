{"word": "Noblest Traits to Be Developed.--The ideas of courtship have their foundation in erroneous ideas concerning marriage. They follow impulse and blind passion. The courtship is carried on in a spirit of flirtation. The parties frequently violate the rules of modesty and reserve and are guilty of indiscretion, if they do not break the law of God. The high, noble, lofty design of God in the institution of marriage is not discerned; therefore the purest affections of the heart, the noblest traits of character, are not developed.--MS 4a, 1885. (MM 141.) \n\n296", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 295}
