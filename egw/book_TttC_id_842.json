    "word": "Many poor souls do not know what they are doing. They unite their influence with Satan's forces, and aid him in his work. They manifest great zeal and earnestness in their blind opposition, as though they were verily doing God's service by fighting against the visions. All who desire to do so can acquaint themselves with the fruits of these visions. For seventeen years God has seen fit to let them survive and strengthen against the opposition of Satan's forces, and the influence of human agencies that have aided Satan in his work.",
