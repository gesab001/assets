{"word": "Chap. 84 - A Miracle Counterfeited\n\n     Some have found difficulty in reconciling a statement in Testimonies for the Church, volume I, page 292, with one in Great Controversy, volume I, page 184. [THE ACCOUNT PRESENTED IN THIS NOW-OUT-OF-PRINT VOLUME WAS REWRITTEN AND AMPLIFIED BY ELLEN G. WHITE AND PUBLISHED IN 1890 AS PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS. SEE PAGE 264 OF THAT VOLUME FOR THE STATEMENT PARALLELING THE ONE REFERRED TO HERE.      [WHITE TRUSTEES.]] These passages refer to the work of the sorcerers in counterfeiting the miracle performed by Aaron, of turning the rod to a serpent. The testimony says: \"The magicians could not perform all those miracles which God wrought through Moses. Only a few of them could they do. The magicians' rods did become serpents, but Aaron's rod swallowed them up.\" This last sentence, which is the one in question, is substantially the same as the Bible statement: \"They cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.\" The statement in volume I, of the Controversy, is: \"The magicians seemed to perform several things with their enchantments similar to those things which God wrought by the hand of Moses and Aaron. They did not really cause their rods to become serpents, but by magic, aided by the great deceiver, made them appear like serpents, \n                                                                           697\nto counterfeit the work of God.\" This statement, instead of contradicting the former, is simply explanatory of it.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 696}
