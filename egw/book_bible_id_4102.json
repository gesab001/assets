{"word": "The union of the divine and the human, manifest in Christ, exists also in the Bible. The truths revealed are all \"given by inspiration of God;\" yet they are expressed in the words of men and are adapted to human needs. Thus it may be said of the Book of God, as it was of Christ, that \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\" And this fact, so far from being an argument against the Bible, should strengthen faith in it as the word of God. Those who pronounce upon the inspiration of the Scriptures, accepting some portions as divine while they reject other parts as human, overlook the fact that Christ, the divine, partook of our human nature, that He might reach humanity. In the work of God for man's redemption, divinity and humanity are combined. \n                                                                           748", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 747}
