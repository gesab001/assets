{"word": "In giving to men an example of what they should be and do, Jesus, the world's Redeemer, did not have a smooth path to travel.... Jesus had been the commander of heaven, yet on earth He was as one that serveth. Uncomplainingly He endured privations, and lived the life of a poor man. He did not indulge in the luxuries that many who claim to be His followers surround themselves with; He studied not at all His pleasure, ease, or convenience. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. His whole life was one of self-denial, expressing the prayer, \"Not my will, but thine, O God, be done.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 156}
