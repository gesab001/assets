{"word": "Reproof Sometimes Needed.--While our words are ever to be kind and tender, no words should be spoken that will lead a wrongdoer to think that his way is not objectionable to God. This is a kind of sympathy that is earthly and deceiving. No license is given for undue manifestation of affection, for sentimental sympathy. Wrongdoers need counsel and reproof, and must sometimes be sharply rebuked.--MS 17, 1899.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 579}
