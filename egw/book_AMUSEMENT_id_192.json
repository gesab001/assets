{"word": "A constant strain upon the brain while the muscles are inactive, enfeebles the nerves and gives to students an almost uncontrollable desire for change and exciting amusements. When they are released, after being confined to study several hours each day, they are nearly wild. Many have never been controlled at home. They have been left to follow inclination, and they think that the restraint of the hours of study is a severe tax upon them; and because they have nothing to do after study hours, Satan suggests sport and mischief for a change. Their influence over other students is demoralizing. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 288}
