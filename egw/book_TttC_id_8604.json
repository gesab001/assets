    "word": "Chap. 83 - Unfounded Reports\n\n     Several times during the past winter [1888-89.] I have met the report that, during the Conference at Minneapolis, \"Sister White was shown that the judgment, which since 1844 had been passing upon the righteous dead, had now begun upon the living.\" This report is not true. A similar rumor, which has been afloat for about two years, originated in this wise: In a letter written from Basel, Switzerland, to a minister in California I made a remark substantially as follows: \"The judgment has been over forty years in progress on the cases of the dead, and we know not how soon it will pass to the cases of the living.\" The letter was read to different persons, and careless hearers reported what they thought they heard. Thus the matter started. The report from Minneapolis arose from someone's misunderstanding of a statement to the same effect as the one quoted from the letter. There is no other foundation for either report than this.",
