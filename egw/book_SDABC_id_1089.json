    "word": "15-19. Peace Only for the Humble.--[Isaiah 57:15-19 quoted.] These words are addressed to those who, awake to their true situation and susceptible to the influence of the Spirit of God, humble themselves before God with contrite hearts. But to those who will not heed the reproof of God, who are determined and froward, and who set themselves to go on in their own way, God cannot speak peace. He cannot heal them; for they will not acknowledge that they need healing. He declares their true condition, \"The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt\" (Letter 106, 1896).",
