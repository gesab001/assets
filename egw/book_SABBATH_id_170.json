{"word": "Gather Into the Sabbath School \n\n     Another work in which all may engage is gathering children and youth into the Sabbath school. The young may in this way labor efficiently for the dear Saviour. They may shape the destinies of souls. They may do a work for the church and the world the extent and greatness of which will never be known until the day of final accounts, when the \"Well done\" is spoken to the good and faithful.--Review and Herald, June 10, 1880.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 130}
