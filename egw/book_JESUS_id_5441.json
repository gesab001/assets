{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     The world's Redeemer went about doing good. When before the people, speaking to them the words of eternal truth, with what earnestness he watched the changing countenances of his hearers. The faces that expressed deep interest and pleasure as they listened to his words, gave him great satisfaction. But when the truth, plainly uttered, touched some cherished sin or idol, he marked the change of  countenance, the cold, stern, forbidding look, which told that the truth was unwelcome. Jesus knew that the plain reproof of sin was the very thing his hearers needed; and the light he shed into the darkened chambers of their minds would have been the greatest blessing to them, had they accepted it. His work was to lay down in simple lines, yet so as to be clearly understood, truths that if obeyed would bring peace and happiness to the soul. He could look beneath the surface, and he saw the cherished sins that were ruining the life and character, that were shutting souls away from God. He pointed out these sins, that all might see them in the true light, and put them away. In some who presented the most hardened exterior, he discerned hopeful subjects. He knew that they would respond to the light, and that they would become his true followers. How grateful we should be to God that he can read every heart as an open book. Human wisdom casts aside many souls that might be saved; for man can judge only by appearance, but God knoweth the heart.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 260}
