Some expressed their thankfulness to God that he had sent Sister White such a great distance to visit them. They had read her books and her articles in their paper, and had thus received most precious light and a great blessing. The Testimonies which had been translated into their language had opened to them the Scriptures, and had made the truth so plain that they could not resist it. A high standard had been presented for them to reach, and this had led them to read the Bible, to search \n183\ntheir hearts, to pray more, to have greater love for Jesus, and to seek more earnestly to save souls.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 182}
