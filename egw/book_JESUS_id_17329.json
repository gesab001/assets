{"word": "We have every encouragement that, if we daily surrender our wills to God, the promise will be fulfilled, \"And of his fulness have we all received, and grace for grace\" (John 1:16). Every revealing of the grace of Christ in our behalf is for us. We are to reveal His grace in our lives, in thought, word, and deed. Let us not lose our opportunity to speak and act Christ Jesus. We are to represent the mercy, the love, and the power of Christ--the power that He has given us. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 329}
