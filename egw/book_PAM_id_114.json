{"word": "Ministers who preach one way and live another are wolves in sheep's clothing.--Wearing the insignia of Christ, they serve the Lord's worst enemy, and heed not the injunction, \"Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\" Christ plainly states that this class of teachers are as wolves in sheep's clothing. They talk of grace, they preach of grace, apparently they pray for grace; but they have not the grace of Christ in their hearts. In the pulpit such ministers may appear to be excellent; but they destroy the force of their words when out of the pulpit by such a course of iniquity that they prove themselves to be ministers of sin, wolves in sheep's clothing.--ST July 18, 1892.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 55}
