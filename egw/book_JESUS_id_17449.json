{"word": "The Jews held that God loved those who served Him,--according to their view, those who fulfilled the requirements of the rabbis,--and that all the rest of the world lay under His frown and curse. Not so, said Jesus; the whole world, the evil and the good, lies in the sunshine of His love. This truth you should have learned from nature itself; for God \"maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MB", "page": 74}
