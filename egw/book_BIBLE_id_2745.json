{"word": "The Lord\\92s philosophy, plainly outlined in His Word, is to be our rule of life. The entire being is to be under the control of the One who knows the end from the beginning. The Bible, and the Bible only is to be our guide. We must follow and obey the life-giving principles of heaven, not only for our inclinations. The wisdom and the power of God, working upon the receptive heart, brings mind and character into harmony with the laws and rules of heaven. Individually we must have the guidance of the Holy Spirit, in order to communicate to the world the great facts of truth and righteousness. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 250}
