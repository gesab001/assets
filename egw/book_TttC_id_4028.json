    "word": "The people upon the mountain prostrate themselves in terror and awe before the unseen God. They cannot look upon the bright consuming fire sent from heaven. They fear that they will be consumed in their apostasy and sins, and cry out with one voice, which resounds over the mountain and echoes to the plains below with terrible distinctness: \"The Lord, He is the God; the Lord, He is the God.\" Israel is at last aroused and undeceived. They see their sin and how greatly they have dishonored God. Their anger is aroused against the prophets of Baal. With terror, Ahab and Baal's priests witness the wonderful exhibition of Jehovah's power. Again the voice of Elijah is heard in startling words of command to the people: \"Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.\" The people are ready to obey his word. They seize the false prophets \n                                                                           286\nwho have deluded them, and bring them to the brook Kishon, and there, with his own hand, Elijah slays these idolatrous priests.",
