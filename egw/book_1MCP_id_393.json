{"word": "I tell you in the fear of God: I know what you may be if your will is placed on the side of God. \"We are laborers together with God\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). You may be doing your work for time and eternity in such a manner that it will stand the test of the judgment. Will you try? Will you now turn square about? You are the object of Christ's love and intercession. Will you now surrender to God and help those who are placed as sentinels to guard the interests of His work, instead of causing them grief and discouragement?--5T 515, 516 (1889).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 124}
