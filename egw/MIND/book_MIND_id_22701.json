    "word": "All the council and committee meetings should be so planned and conducted that these wearing, taxing seasons may be lessened both in number and duration. \n\n\n                -76- \n\nThose who engage in them should give much thought to the matters to be considered before bringing them before the committee, and [they] should come quickly to the points of interest. Make them plain, and let everyone try to dispatch the business as speedily as possible, and not hold and tax the minds and bodies of men for long hours to do the business that might and should be dispatched promptly. There should be a constant effort for brevity in business meetings.",
