    "word": "All who in faith receive the Word of God will be doers of that Word. Their minds will be enlarged by a true knowledge, which Christ represents as eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God. And as they practise the truth, they hold forth the Word of life to others. Thus they become an influence among influences, a savor of life unto life.",
