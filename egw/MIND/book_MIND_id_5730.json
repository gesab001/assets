    "word": "Fresh Air. \n     872. Air, air, the precious boon of heaven, which all may have, will bless you with its invigorating influence if you will not refuse it entrance. Welcome it, cultivate a love for it, and it will prove a precious soother of the nerves. . . . It refreshes the body, . . . while at the same time its influence is decidedly felt upon the mind, imparting a degree of composure and serenity. . . . It induces sound, sweet sleep.--T., V. I, p. 702.",
