    "word": "The knowledge of God is obtained from his word. The experimental knowledge of true godliness, in daily consecration and service to God, insures the highest culture of mind, soul, and body; and this consecration of all our powers to God prevents self-exaltation. The impartation of divine power honors our sincere striving after wisdom for the conscientious use of our highest faculties to honor God and bless our fellow men. As these faculties are derived from God, and not self-created, they should be appreciated as talents from God to be employed in his service.",
