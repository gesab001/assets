    "word": "Satan had tried to eclipse from human minds the knowledge of God, and to eradicate from their hearts the attributes of God. . . . That which God had revealed was misconstrued, misapplied, and mingled with satanic delusions. Satan will quote Scripture in order to deceive. He tried to deceive Christ in this way. So he still tries to deceive. . . . Christ came to adjust truths that had been misplaced and made to serve the cause of error. He recalled them, repeated them, . . . and bade them stand fast forever.\u2014Manuscript 32, 1896 (Manuscript Releases, vol. 17, pp. 20, 21).",
