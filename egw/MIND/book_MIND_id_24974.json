    "word": "Silence is Eloquence. \n\n                                Sanitarium, Cal., Nov. 15, 1906. \n\nTo the Workers at the Madison School:-- \n     I write to you to be sure to bear in mind at this time that silence is eloquence. To open up all matters concerning the beginning of your work at Madison would not be wisdom. I have just received a letter regarding your work, but I can not now deal with it as I wish. I wish to say to you, Be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves. Some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. It will not be well for you to open to everybody all things concerning the work in Nashville and in Madison. There are those who are associated with us, and who occupy positions of trust, who may not stand the test. It will not be safe to try to make all understand everything. Those things that are of a private character, you should not make public. Let them be kept within the knowledge of your special few.",
