    "word": "I might go to any length upon this subject, but I forbear. I do hope that you, as a physician, will not by precept and example counterwork that which the Lord has given me to enlighten minds and bring in thorough reforms. I am working earnestly along these lines, and shall never cease working against the practise of meat-eating. I have had opened before me the stumbling-block which this diet question has been in your own spiritual advancement, and what a stumbling block you have placed in the paths of others, and all because your own sensibilities were blunted through the selfish gratification of the appetite. For Christ's sake look deeper, study deeper, and act in accordance with the light God has been pleased to give you and others on this subject. \n                            Mrs. E. G. White",
