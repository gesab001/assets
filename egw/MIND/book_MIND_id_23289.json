    "word": "\"Will you thinking men please to put your thoughts upon these matters for a time, and then consider what spirit is actuating you, and has been moving you at and since the Minneapolis meeting? Your questioning would certainly be sensible if directed to the very things you might well question, and your faith become strong in these things you might safely believe. If you have not had evidence that the testimonies bear the divine credentials, will you tell me what will the Lord give you in the gifts to His church that do bear the stamp of heaven? Will you please let your reasoning criticize some of these matters and settle them satisfactorily to your own minds? Will you not be obliged, as candid men, to say you have been working in the dark, away from light and evidence and truth? This spirit does not bear the marks of the divine, but of the power and subtlety of the enemy of God and of man. I say it is from beneath and not in harmony with the Spirit of God, \n                                                                           631\nor with the message He has given His servants to bear at the present time. When the Lord sends us light and food that all the churches need, we may well expect that the enemy of all righteousness will do his utmost to prevent that light coming in its native heavenly bearings to the people. He lays hold of minds full of unbelief and doubts to wheel into his service, to serve his purpose, to intercept the light that God means shall come to His chosen ones.\"",
