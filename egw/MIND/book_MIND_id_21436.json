    "word": "During the week of prayer we had good meetings in Newcastle. I spoke twice under the tent, Sabbath and Sunday afternoons. The Lord blessed me with freedom. I looked upon that people so interested in the word of God and called to mind how, a few months before, there was not a Sabbathkeeper in Newcastle. Now about thirty have been baptized, and ten more will soon go forward. We thank the Lord and praise His holy name for His wonderful works to the children of men.",
