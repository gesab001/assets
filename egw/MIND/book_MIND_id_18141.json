THE LIGHT HERE THROWN UPON THE LAST TEACHINGS AND ACTS OF CHRIST, PRIOR TO HIS CRUCIFIXION, MAKES PLAIN TO THE INQUIRING MIND MANY SACRED AND IMPORTANT TRUTHS; AND THE SPECIAL ILLUMINATIONS WITH WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN FAVORED BY HEAVEN, COMMEND THESE PAGES TO THE CAREFUL PERUSAL OF THE READER.\n\n                                                PUBLISHERS.\n\n\n                   The Sufferings of Christ\n\n                      The Passover Supper. \n\n     The scribes and priests now counseled together how they might take Jesus without raising a tumult among the people; for many of those who witnessed his mighty works believed him to be the prophet of the Most High, and would have been greatly incensed at any attempt upon his liberty. So the dignitaries decided that open violence would not be good policy, but that treachery must serve their purpose.",
