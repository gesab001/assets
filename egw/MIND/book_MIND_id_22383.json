    "word": "There is no use in talking of harmony while they continue to do this, for harmony could never exist. God forbids it. There is to be a decided change in those who have kept up their warfare against the principles delivered to us by the Lord. Truth is truth, and righteousness is righteousness. To those who have separated in principle from true believers, choosing their own course, the word is spoken, \"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\" There is to be unity, but it is to be on the right basis. The testimonies that God has given cannot be disannulled. They stand fast in conformity to the word of the living God.",
