    "word": "If ever there was a time when the writings of every one connected with our work should be closely criticized, it is now. The Lord has made known to me that His word is to be studied, and as no such representations as those made in Living Temple are made in the word, we are to reject them. We are to take the word as God has given it to us. If Christ had thought it essential for such theories to be presented to human minds, He would have included them in His teachings. As our Owner and Redeemer, He has put in His word all the instruction that is necessary for our salvation.--Manuscript 127, 1905.",
