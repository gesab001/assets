    "word": "To some the Lord has given a special work, in bearing testimonies of warning and reproof, to break down the strongholds of iniquity, to arouse conviction in the human heart, and bring man to repentance. Some messages come as the Lord's hammer, to break down the workings of Satan, and bring men to the living God. But mingled with this decided work of standing in defense of the truth is Christ's consolation, which comes when repentance reveals what sin really is. And while some are called to battle desperately with an evil work, there is another kind of message to be borne to the ones who, while suffering wrong, have endured the temptation to harbor a sense of injustice and cherish it in the mind.",
