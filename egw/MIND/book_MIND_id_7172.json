    "word": "Desecrated Shrines \n\n     Those who profess to serve God, and yet make no advancement in knowledge and piety, are Christians only in name. The soul-temple is filled with desecrated shrines. Frivolous reading, trifling conversation, and worldly pleasure, occupy the mind so completely that there is no room left for the entrance of God's Word. Worldliness, frivolity, and pride take the place which Christ should occupy in the soul. . . .",
