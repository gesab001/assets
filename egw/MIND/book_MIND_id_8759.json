    "word": "Let us not cast away our confidence, but have firm assurance, firmer than ever before. \u201cHitherto hath the Lord helped us,\u201d and He will help us to the end (1 Samuel 7:12). Let us look to the monumental pillars, reminders of what the Lord has done to comfort us and to save us from the hand of the destroyer. Let us keep fresh in our memory all the tender mercies that God has shown us\u2014the tears He has wiped away, the pains He has soothed, the anxieties removed, the fears dispelled, the wants supplied, the blessings bestowed\u2014thus strengthening ourselves for all that is before us through the remainder of our pilgrimage.",
