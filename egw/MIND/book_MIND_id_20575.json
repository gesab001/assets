    "word": "Cautions to Elder Prescott (To W. W. Prescott)--I have been shown your peril during the time of your connecting with Dr. E. J. Waggoner. You both came to the conference of 1891, enthused with what you supposed to be precious spiritual light. You were desirous of presenting this light to me, but I was shown that much of that which you supposed to be precious light was dangerous, misleading fables, and that I must have no conversation with you regarding these ideas that were filling your minds.",
