MS. 31-'08. \n\n\n                        Deeper Consecration \n\n\n     The teachers employed in our schools should be men who are acquainted with God through an experimental knowledge. They know Him because they obey all the commandments He has given them. Jehovah engraved His ten commandments on tables of stone, that all the inhabitants of the earth might understand His eternal and unchangeable character. Those teachers who desire to advance in learning and proficiency, need to lay right hold of these wonderful revelations of God. But it is only as heart and mind are brought into harmony with God that they will understand the divine requirements.",
