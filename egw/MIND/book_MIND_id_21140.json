    "word": "If the wife is a co-laborer with Christ in the work of saving souls, she will keep abreast of her husband in cultivating mind and heart. She will endeavor to stand equal with him in knowledge of the Word of God, and in obedience to all its requirements. She will keep her own soul refreshed by eating the Word and drinking the waters from the wellsprings of life. Then the words she speaks will not be prompted by envy or jealousy; they will proceed from a sanctified heart that has been daily learning lessons at the feet of Jesus. Thus instead of making herself a helpless burden, to be the object of his solicitude, and to demand a large share of his attention, the wife may strengthen her husband to do the highest service for God.",
