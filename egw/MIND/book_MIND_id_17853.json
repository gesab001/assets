Their influence, while at the Institute, was not as good as it should have been. They are too much bound up in selfishness, and they are both far from loving their neighbors as themselves. Bro. Palmer has greater interest in, and love for, the truth than sister Palmer. But he has had his mind molded very much by his wife. Selfishness has girded her about as with iron hands. Her spirit is not in accordance with the spirit and life of Christ. They do not love their neighbor as Christ loves. Sister Palmer has not, during her religious experience, given evidence that she has that love that can bear any comparison with that of her Saviour. Love one another, says Christ, as I have loved you. This command does not merely reach to the members of our own families. It reaches to our brethren, sisters, and even unbelievers. The supreme love which sister Palmer has ever had for herself has stood directly in the way of her spiritual advancement, and if continued, will surely prevent her perfecting a Christian character. Sister Palmer is deceived in herself. She thinks she is in a favorable condition before God, when the message to the Laodicean church applies to her. \"I know thy works [it is not the profession that God regards, but works], that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or \n                                                                           49\nhot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\"",
