    "word": "Do you think that any of us, when He comes, will be brought before the great Judge and will feel that we have devoted too much time to preparation? Will such thoughts come into our minds? Shall we think that we have been altogether too sympathetic, that we have devoted too much time in winning souls back to Christ, and binding up the brokenhearted? No indeed. Our thoughts will be these as we look back to those who stand before the Judge: \"Why didn't I help them at such a time when I ought to?\" or, \"O, I am glad I did deny myself and help them to stand on the solid rock.\" These are the very thoughts that will come up to us in the judgment when everyone is judged according to the deeds done in the body.",
