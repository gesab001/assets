    "word": "When God's people are worked by the Holy Spirit, they will manifest a zeal that is according to knowledge. When they are guided by the Spirit, they will no longer lead others in false paths. They will reflect the light that God has been giving for years. The spirit of criticism will be put away. Filled with the spirit of humility, they will be of one mind, united with one another and with Christ.--Ms 107, 1903, p. 7. (Diary, \"Unity With the Father,\" Sept. 15, 1903.)",
