    "word": "What do you think of my plan of dispensing with articles for the papers, so that Fannie, Marian, and I may all turn our minds to the making of books? We could get up a number of small books as I have suggested, and then after the period of a year I could again take hold of the paper work. We could work in these lines of preparing books, and take no money from the conference. I started with a full determination to write this year on \"The Life of Christ,\" but such earnest calls have been made for my labor in other fields, that I dared not refuse them, and so have not done what I expected to do on the book. I have written articles on different parts of the life and work of Christ, and after Fannie has prepared them, Marian has culled out of them matter that she could make use of in the book. But I have so many interruptions that I cannot write as I should. It is not much use for me to try to do this, and yet have the care of the churches, the responsibility of a household, and the work of a hotel-keeper; for comers and goers are continually creating an excitement at my home.",
