    "word": "Those who are bearing responsibilities in our institutions and in various branches of the Lord's work, need to be constant learners in the school of Christ. We must understand and know that the Lord is at the head of the work; although we do not always discern His overruling power. At all times it is our privilege to know that He is there, and to have the assurance that He will work with us if we will work with Him. But if one plans one thing and another plans another thing, and each endeavors to lead, we shall get things into confusion. We may avoid this if we will. We may carry this work intelligently, in the love and fear of God. If we will make up our minds to do this at any sacrifice, if we labor patiently, we shall not fail.",
