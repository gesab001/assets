    "word": "Everything on the ground is fitted up in nice order. It has cost considerable labor to take a forest and prepare it for a campground, making it attractive and beautiful, but this has been done here. It is the admiration of all who look upon it. The man owning the ground has promised them the land for five years without cost to them, in consideration of the work done to prepare it. The trees are fir and tower up high like the redwood trees of California, only more beautiful in foliage. Some oak and walnut are interspersed. White pine here reminds me of Maine. The very atmosphere is fragrant with the perfume of these evergreen trees.",
