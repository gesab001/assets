    "word": "The locality in which wealthy men dwell may appear desirable, but the heavenly intelligences are not welcomed to their houses as divine messengers. They want God afar off, that they may not be reminded of their evil works. The Lord would not be pleased for any of our institutions to be permanently erected in such a supposedly advantageous locality, for this would be like Lot choosing Sodom without any reference to the associations among \n\n\n                                   -236- \n\nwhich he was to abide. In the selection of a location for a sanitarium, we are to choose with the thought ever in mind that our work and purpose is to restore the moral image of God in man. We are connected with Christ, co-workers with the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. Each soul is of value with God, and those who are ever abusing His mercies, misappropriating and embezzling the goods of heaven, are not the men whom God can use to cooperate with Him in the grand work of redemption. They are fixing their own destiny in this world and in the future, eternal world.",
