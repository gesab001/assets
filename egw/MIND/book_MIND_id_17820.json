    "word": "Medical students, by studying the word of God diligently, are far better prepared for all other studies; for enlightenment always comes with an earnest study of the word of God. Let it be understood by medical missionaries that the better acquainted they become with the Bible history, the better qualified they will be to do their work. The students in the college at Battle Creek need to aspire to higher knowledge; and nothing can give them a knowledge of all lessons and a retentive memory like the searching of the Scriptures. Let there be genuine discipline in study. There should be a most humble, prayerful longing of the soul to know the truth. There should be faithful teachers, who will strive to make the students understand their lessons, not alone by explaining everything themselves, but by letting the students explain thoroughly every passage \n\n\n                      -35- \n\nwhich they read. Let the inquiring minds of the students be respected. \n  Dec. 1, 1895. \n\n                                               -",
