    "word": "That Ellen White had a real affection for her husband is very evident. In practically every letter she sent her love along to him. At times she closed her letters with the endearing words, \"Your Ellen\" (e.g. Letter 6, 1876). Occasionally she reminded him that his absence was sorely felt. Only two days after he left for the East she wrote, \"It takes a little time to get settled down from the excitement of your going. You may be assured that we miss you. Especially do we feel the loss of your society when we gather about the fireside evenings. We feel your absence when we sit around the social board.\" (Letter 1a, 1876). A little later she explained further, \"We miss you . . . very much, but we are so buried up in our writing we have no time . . . to be lonesome while thus engaged; but when gathered about the fireside, then there is a great miss.\" (Letter 9, 1876).",
