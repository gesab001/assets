    "word": "Many in our churches and institutions are not sanctified by the truth they profess. If they had the Spirit of Christ they would not notice small slights, but their minds would be occupied in contemplating the love of Jesus. They need spiritual discernment, that they may not be the sport of Satan's temptations. They would not then be continually seeing things of which to complain. If the instruction which Christ has given were followed out in the spirit that every true Christian should have--if each, when aggrieved, would go to the offending member and seek in kindness to correct the wrong by privately telling him his fault--many a grievous trial would be averted. But many will resort to every expedient rather than fall on the Rock Christ Jesus and be broken. All such expedients must fail.",
