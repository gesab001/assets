    "word": "This is the work of a cunning Devil. Those who are troubled with doubts, and have difficulties which they cannot solve, should not throw other weak minds into the same perplexity. Some have hinted, or have talked their unbelief, and have passed on little dreaming of the effect produced. The seeds of unbelief, in some instances, have taken immediate effect, and in some cases have lain buried quite a length of time, until the individuals take a wrong course, and give place to the enemy, and the light of God is withdrawn from them, and they fall under the powerful temptations of Satan. Then the seeds of infidelity spring up, which were sown so long ago. Satan nourishes them, and they bear fruit. Anything coming from ministers, who should stand in the light, has a powerful influence. And when they have not stood in the clear light of God, Satan has used them as agents, and has through them transmitted his fiery darts to minds not prepared to resist what has come from their ministers.",
