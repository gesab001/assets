    "word": "The Lord is still gracious; the Lord will still pardon, but your character must be transformed. There must be no guile found in the mouth of those who stand on the sea of glass. All this exaggeration, all misstatements, everything untrue, must be put away from you, and you stand forth out of every secret work, open as the day, and you living as seeing Him who is invisible. This is the last appeal I expect to make to you. I still have a letter packed away by mistake, [which] I shall send you if the Lord bids me; then our communication ends, if you remain of the same mind.",
