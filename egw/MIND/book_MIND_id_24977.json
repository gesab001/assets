    "word": "We have moral and social obligations to meet. There is an abundance of work for all to do. Many are groping in darkness and following the paths of selfish gratification, while professing the name of Christ. They have not felt the responsibility developing upon them to grow up to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. Such ones need the help of a kind heart, a helpful hand, to lead them back into the paths of righteousness. As Christians we have a special work before us which if we will do in humility of mind, God will honor with his blessing. \n\n\n                                       (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
