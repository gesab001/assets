    "word": "We are living in perilous times, when those who profess to love and obey God deny Him in their daily lives. \"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\" God does not want you to be found among this class, dear youth. In His word you may learn how to shun these evils, and in the end be overcomers. . . .",
