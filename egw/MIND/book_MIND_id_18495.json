    "word": "I saw that the family of Bro. Daigneau need a great work done for them. Samuel and Charlie have gone to great lengths in this crime of self-abuse; especially is this true of Charlie, who has gone so far in the practice of this sin that his intellect is affected, his eye sight is weakened, and disease is fastening itself upon him. Satan has almost full control of this poor boy's mind. His parents are not awake to see the evil and its results. His mind is debased, his conscience is hardened, his moral sensibilities are benumbed, and he will be a ready victim to be led into sin and crime by evil associates. Bro. and Sr. D., arouse yourselves, I beg of you. You have not received the light of health reform, and acted upon it. If you had restricted your appetites you would have been saved much extra labor and expense; and what is of vastly more consequence, you would have preserved to yourselves a better condition of health, and a greater degree of physical and intellectual strength to appreciate \n                                                                           22\neternal truths; you would have a clearer brain to weigh the evidences of truth, and be better prepared to give to others a reason of the hope that is in you. Your food is not of that simple, healthful quality to make the best kind of blood. Foul blood will surely becloud the moral and intellectual, and arouse and strengthen the baser passions of your nature. Neither of you can afford a feverish diet, for it is at the expense of the health of the body, and the prosperity of your own souls, and the souls of your children.",
