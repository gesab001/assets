    "word": "We have, Sister Harriet, everything to be thankful for, that Jesus is our Advocate and that He pleads in our behalf. As I write upon my book I feel intensely moved. I want to get it out as soon as possible, for our people need it so much. I shall complete it next month if the Lord gives me health as He has done. I have been unable to sleep nights, thinking of the important things to take place. Three hours' sleep, and sometimes five is the most I get. My mind is stirred so deeply I cannot rest. Write, write, write, I feel that I must, and not delay.",
