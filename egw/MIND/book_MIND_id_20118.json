    "word": "Merciful Redeemer, Thou knowest every one. Here are some who are weighted down with burdens that have rested heavily upon them. May they link up with Thee. May they put their arm in Thine arm, and cling to Thee, the mighty One, who hast said, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\" (Isaiah 27:5.) These are Thy words; show them how, Lord. Show them how to humble their proud hearts. Show them what it means to break their will before God, and to take Thy will. Help them to cast their helpless souls upon the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour. Present before them eternal life. Let the sweetness of Thy Holy Spirit come into the hearts of Thy ministers, that Thy melting, merciful love, may be manifest in their life. I ask Thee to dispel everything that would prevent them from working for the salvation of souls. Put it into their hearts and minds to make a covenant with Thee by sacrifice. Even now, may the melting love of Christ come into our midst. May we hear the words, \"Thou art Mine, I have begotten thee unto Myself.\"",
