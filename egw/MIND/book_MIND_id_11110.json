    "word": "The Redeemer of the world does not sanction experience and exercise in religious matters independent of his organized and acknowledged church. Many have an idea that they are responsible to Christ alone for their light and experience, independent of his recognized followers on earth. But in the history of the conversion of Saul, important principles are given us, which we should ever bear in mind. He was brought directly into the presence of Christ. He was one whom Christ intended for a most important work, one who was to be \"a chosen vessel\" unto him; yet he did not personally impart to him the lessons of truth. He arrested his course and convicted him; but when asked by him, \"What wilt thou have me to do?\" the Saviour placed him in connection with his church, and let them direct him what to do.",
