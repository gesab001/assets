    "word": "Mind to Be Educated to Exercise Faith.--Faith works by love and purifies the soul from all selfishness. Thus the soul is perfected in love. And having found grace and mercy through Christ's precious blood, how can we fail to be tender and merciful? \"By grace are ye saved through faith\" (Ephesians 5:8). The mind should be educated to exercise faith rather than to cherish doubt and suspicion and jealousy. We are too prone to look at obstacles as impossibilities.",
