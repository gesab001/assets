    "word": "Since my husband's death, I have repeatedly received such warnings as those: 'Beware of men in high places. Do not place yourself in the power or under the control of men; for there will be those who do not understand the way of God's working. You must not be bound. Do not tie your hands by any decisions you may be urged to make. Too often selfishness will control the mind and judgment of men. I have plain testimonies for you to bear, but the men who know not God and the sanctification of his Spirit will mislead. They will not receive the testimonies of the truth., they will not be corrected. They will cherish jealousy. Through envy, through resistance of the Spirit of God they will give heed to the suggestions of Satan, and will make it very hard for you to do the work I have given you to do. I have placed you so that you shall have influence and means in trust to establish my work, to advance the interest of my kingdom, and not be hindered by the judgment and decisions of men who do not make it their study to know the mind and will of God.",
