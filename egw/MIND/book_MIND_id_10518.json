    "word": "Revealed in a Flash of Light.--The question is asked, How does Sister White know in regard to the matters of which she speaks so decidedly, as if she had authority to say these things? I speak thus because they flash upon my mind when in perplexity like lightning out of a dark cloud in the fury of a storm. Some scenes presented before me years ago have not been retained in my memory, but when the instruction then given is needed, sometimes even when I am standing before the people, the remembrance comes sharp and clear, like a flash of lightning, [COMMENTING ON THE MANNER LIGHT OFTEN CAME TO ELLEN WHITE, W. C. WHITE, HER SON, IN A STATEMENT SHE FULLY ENDORSED, DECLARED: \"THE THINGS WHICH SHE HAS WRITTEN OUT, ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF FLASHLIGHT PICTURES AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS GIVEN HER REGARDING THE ACTIONS OF MEN, AND THE INFLUENCE OF THESE ACTIONS UPON THE WORK OF GOD FOR THE SALVATION OF MEN, WITH VIEWS OF PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE HISTORY IN ITS RELATION TO THIS WORK\" (WCW OCT. 30, 1911, BEFORE GC COUNCIL; SEE APPENDIX A).--COMPILERS.] bringing to mind distinctly that particular instruction. At such times I cannot refrain from saying the things that flash into my mind, not because I have had a new vision, but because that which was presented to me, perhaps years in the past, has been recalled to my mind forcibly.--Manuscript 33, 1911.",
