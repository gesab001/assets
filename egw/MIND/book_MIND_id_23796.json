    "word": "It is righteousness that exalts a nation; and it is sin that brings ruin. With humble, contrite hearts let all study the Bible. That which is revealed in the Scriptures is for you and for your children. Eat the word, and digest it; for it is the bread of life. But do not be eager and troubled to know something in regard to things that are not revealed. Some do not seem to comprehend that which is plainly opened before them in the Scriptures concerning their eternal salvation, and as a result, their practical life is greatly deficient. If they studied the word of God and obeyed it, their minds would not be so full of conjectures in regard to things they need not understand or comprehend.",
