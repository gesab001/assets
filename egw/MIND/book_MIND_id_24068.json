    "word": "It is a wrong education to teach our people to lean on human aids, instead of going to the Lord in prayer. The enemy of souls has been the instigator of this, that minds might become obscured. The people are now to be instructed differently. God's people are to meet together in counsel, but no leader or worker is to take the position that God's children are to make no move until he is first consulted. Those who bear responsibilities in the work are to cooperate with heavenly angels in teaching men and women to look to God as the source of their strength.",
