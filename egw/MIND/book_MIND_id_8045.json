    "word": "He Used Plain Language.--Argument is good in its place, but far more can be accomplished by simple explanations of the Word of God. The lessons of Christ were illustrated so clearly that the most ignorant could readily comprehend them. Jesus did not use long and difficult words in His discourses; He used plain language, adapted to the minds of the common people. He went no further into the subject He was expounding than they were able to follow Him.--GW 169 (1915).",
