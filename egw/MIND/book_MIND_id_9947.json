    "word": "When children lose their self-control, and speak passionate words, the parents should for a time keep silence, neither reproving nor condemning. At such times silence is golden, and will do more to bring repentance than any words that can be uttered. Satan is well pleased when parents irritate their children by speaking harsh, angry words. Paul has given a caution on this point: \"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.\" They may be very wrong, but you cannot lead them to the right by losing patience with them. Let your calmness help to restore them to a proper frame of mind.",
