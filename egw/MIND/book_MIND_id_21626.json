    "word": "The encroachments made by men on the liberty of their fellow men are condemned by God. These encroachments, which are not seen in their true bearing, are inspired by the enemy of God, to cut off the opportunity for God to work on minds by His Spirit. Those who do not know God, who refuse to hear His voice or to be ruled by Him, will stand with cord in hand, ready to bind the Lord's workers and trammel them in their efforts.",
