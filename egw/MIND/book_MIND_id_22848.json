    "word": "We may constantly seek the joy of His presence. We need not be all the time upon our knees in prayer, but we may be constantly asking for His grace, even when we are walking on the streets, or when we are engaged in our ordinary daily duties. We may constantly keep the mind ascending to Christ, and He will freely impart to us of His grace, for He Himself has said, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\"",
