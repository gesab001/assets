    "word": "Wisdom from God to be Interwoven in Daily Experiences--With the grace of Christ in the soul, you may be mighty through God, beating back the powers of darkness.  No power but truth will keep you steadfast, having the glory of God ever in view.  Those who are closely connected with you have solemn responsibilities.  You repose confidence in them, and it is their duty to cling to God, and have an eye single to His glory, hanging firmly upon the arm of Omnipotence, not trusting in or relying upon any human arm.  They should make the most of their own God-given faculties, for they must give an account of the same to God; they are to be constantly growing; they are never to cease to progress.  But all the aids that can be brought to them as soldiers of Jesus Christ in this holy warfare should be enlisted.  All knowledge that the apostle would acknowledge as true science, as far as possible should be acquired.  Everything that can strengthen or expand the mind should be cultivated to the utmost individual power.  And notwithstanding all this may be the privilege of those connected with you, but few are now making the standard, and there is danger of their being deceived in their own acquirements.  They will be falling back if not growing, and you will be also under delusion unless the wisdom that cometh from God be interwoven into yours as well as their daily experience.",
