    "word": "Minister In Spiritual Things. \n\n     The presidents of conferences, the ministers of the churches, should give themselves to the spiritual interests of the people, and should be excused from the mechanical labor attendant on the camp-meeting. The ministers should not be \n\n\n                     -27- \n\nwearied out, but should feel refreshed and be in a cheerful frame of mind; for this is essential to the best good of the meetings. They should be able to speak words of cheer and courage and drop seeds of spiritual truth into the soil of honest hearts, to spring up and bear precious fruit.",
