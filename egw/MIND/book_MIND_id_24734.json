    "word": "The truths contained in the Scriptures are grand, elevating, uplifting, ennobling. If the lost image of God is restored in this world, these truths must be cherished. They are graced with such simplicity that they could not possibly have originated in any human mind. A sower from a higher world went forth to sow in the world with seed. This higher phase of education only is able to prepare students for the higher school, where Christ and God will be the teachers, and where throughout eternity, we shall learn how best to magnify and glorify God's name.",
