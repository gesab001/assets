    "word": "The Beautiful Surroundings \n\n     I have now been at the Melrose sanitarium for a week, and find it one of the most favorably located sanitariums that I have ever seen. The spacious lawns, the noble trees, the beauty of the scenery all around, answer to the representations given me of what our sanitariums ought to be. The quietude is delightful. The surroundings are attractive to the eye and refreshing to the mind. Here I see the very pictures that I have been shown in vision,-- patients amid beautiful surroundings lying out in the sunshine in wheel-chairs and on cots. I see before me the sights that the Lord has helped me to present before our people in print.",
