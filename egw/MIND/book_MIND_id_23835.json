    "word": "You are to apply the laws of life and health to your own case. In violating the laws of health, even in doing the service of God, you misrepresent your maker. He is not unmindful of your work of diligence, of your fervour, but you must remember that you are not a sound man. Your digestive organs are in a very bad state. You ought to be where you can have the most nutritious food. Vegetables should not come into your diet. Some can subsist upon vegetable food, but you cannot. When your food produces gases and an offensive breath, you should know that things are not as they should be. You need a better circulation. Your imagination is very active. The Lord would have the human machinery better cared for. You do not bring yourself to time. You cannot keep up this strain as you have done; for you are lessening your physical, mental and moral powers. You must have a period of rest.",
