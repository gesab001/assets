    "word": "You need to be converted. You need to ask in humility and contrition, \"What must I do to be saved?\" The whole powers of your being need to be called into earnest effort for the salvation of your soul. As you cast yourself on Christ, you are fulfilling His purpose for you. You are no longer a law to yourself. But no violence is done to your will and your freedom of action. The mind is brought under the authority of a new law. But it is the royal law of liberty. The whole being is surrendered to God. The heart is transformed by the Spirit's power.",
