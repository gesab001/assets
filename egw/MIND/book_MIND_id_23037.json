    "word": "Principles and practices must be strictly guarded. Habits are formed by training the mind in a certain course of action. What we do once, we do more readily the second time, and we learn to pursue a certain course by force of habit. If we are trained to cavil, we shall be trained to doubt and uncertainty. When Jesus is not abiding in the soul, the natural tendency to doubt, question, and criticize will extend to God's Word, as well as to the testimonies, and the habit of caviling will ruin the soul. In place of godly fear and holy reverence in handling the Scriptures, there will be a forward, bold assumption, a proud, boasting spirit that loves to strive, and the most sacred things will be lightly regarded, the most sacred feelings will be trampled upon. God has but little to do with such workers.",
