    "word": "Will God's people be aroused? He has been calling, calling after certain ones who have defied Him; and the figures have been accumulating against them, while their ingenuity has been increasing in the work of deceiving if possible the very elect. With satanic cunning they have striven to gain control of minds and of property. They have spurned many overtures of mercy upon condition of repentance. The list of their evil deeds has been swelling. The wrath of God's signal displeasure is hanging over them; and they will not always be permitted to continue practicing their deceptive methods to draw souls into masked nets. Finally the word will go forth that divine patience has been exhausted.",
