    "word": "Do not give the same discourse over and over again. Leave some chance for the Spirit of God to impress you, to give you fresh ideas and increased light. We all need hearts susceptible to the impress of the Spirit of God, hearts thoroughly imbued with His Spirit. That which we learn in the school of Christ will be meekness and lowliness of heart. We are ever to be learners, Bible students. We cannot study the Scriptures with a heart to learn and understand without obtaining fresh ideas, increased light. Do not have your set discourses, going over the same ground, having the same ending, and leave no chance for the Spirit of God to bring to your mind things new and old from the treasury of truth.",
