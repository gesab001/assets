    "word": "You should learn to be just before you are generous with yourself. Principle must be observed in making donations for the cause of God. Your brethren's stewardship belongs to them, and you have a stewardship of your own. God does not make a steward of their means. May God help you to look upon all these matters in the right light. Wherever you go to labor, and the Lord gives you success, many become attached \n\n\n                          [31] \n\nto you. When God works with your effort, you can accomplish much good; but when your weakness is developed, and the brethren see that your practice is contrary to your teaching, it throws them into confusion, and begets doubt and suspicion in their minds in regard to your whole ministry, and the arguments you have presented. Those who have genuine belief in the truth say, \"I cannot see how Elder Daniels can preach as he does and retain his influence with the people, when he does not practice what he teaches.\" Although you may have the sound, ennobling doctrines of the Bible, although you may preach the word, presenting line upon line, and precept upon precept, yet if your discourses are not backed up out of the pulpit by personal piety and devotion, if you do not practice your own teachings, you become a stumbling-block to those who are weak in the faith.",
