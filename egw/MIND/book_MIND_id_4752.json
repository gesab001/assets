    "word": "Some, through inexperience, will make mistakes, but should be kindly shown how they can do their work better. And thus you can be educating, until you have men and women of experience in the cause of God, who can bear responsibilities, and who will be prepared for the good work that is suffering so much for the want of laborers. We need men who can take responsibilities; and the best way for them to gain the experience they need, is to engage with heart and mind in the work.\u2014MS.",
