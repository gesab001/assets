    "word": "We are encouraged as we see the work that is being done in Chicago, and in a few other places. But years ago the large responsibility that centered in Battle Creek should have been distributed. You may look with great satisfaction at the wide-spreading growth of the Sanitarium in Battle Creek, but God does not look with the same approval upon this as you do. If institutions had been built up in other localities, if men had been authorized in carrying responsibilities, there would have been far more strength, far more accuracy in the work, and we should have moved more in accordance with the mind and will of God than we have moved. As it is, a few men are carrying heavy responsibilities. A few wield an influence that has a controlling power on the management of the work far and near, yet some of these men need to be converted. Christ says to them as he said to Nicodemus, \"Ye must be born again.\" \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" He asked the question, \"Art thou ruler in Israel, and knowest not these things?\" Many are controlled by a spirit that is not Christlike, They have not yet learned in the school of Christ the lesson of meekness and lowliness of heart. Their lives are not fashioned after the divine similitude. Year after year they carry responsibilities of a sacred order, yet prove themselves incapable of distinguishing between the sacred and the common. How long shall such men continue to yield a controlling influence? How long shall their word be permitted to exalt or to cast down, to condemn, or to lift \n                                                                           1418\nup? How long shall they hold such power that no one dare to make a change in their methods?",
