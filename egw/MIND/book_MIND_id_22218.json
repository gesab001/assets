    "word": "I sent you a long letter containing account of the meeting in southern California directly after I sent the one you mention. You probably received it soon after. Sometimes I have been too nervous to write. Once Mary wrote for me. I have written you several letters since I came to Washington Territory. I am very much pleased to get this letter from you because it relieves my mind of a great anxiety. I know nothing [of] what God has for me in the future, but I do hope to have clear light in regard to my duty and to do everything as for eternity.",
