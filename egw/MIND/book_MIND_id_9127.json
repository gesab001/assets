    "word": "Ministers should sometimes gain listeners' interest in Bible doctrine by first giving talks on health.--In our sanitariums our ministers, who labor in Word and doctrine, should give short talks upon the principles of temperance, showing that the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and bringing to the minds of the people the responsibility resting upon them as God's purchased possession to make the body a holy temple, fit for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. As this instruction is given, the people will become interested in Bible doctrine.--Te 245.",
