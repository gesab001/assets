    "word": "Though I may fail to make an impression on the minds of some of my brethren, I shall not keep silent; I will begin to plead with another class. I have said quite enough to those who ought to have taken heed. I have endured agony of soul because of the disregard of the warnings God has given, because of the want of consecration on the part of men who should be in touch with God, living channels of light, faithful sentinels with eyes keen to see and discern the needs for this time. God has given me relief. I have spoken the word of the Lord, and now I will wait and let God bear me up. I will trust in Him, and Him alone. I feel shaken off from every human being. I shall look to God, and to Him alone, to learn my duty, for I dare not trust in man or make flesh my arm. My work will be to cry aloud and spare not, whether men will bear or forbear.",
