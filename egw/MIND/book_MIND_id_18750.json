    "word": "The young are in great danger. Much evil results from their light and trifling reading. Much time is lost which should be spent in useful employment. Some would even deprive themselves of sleep that they might finish some ridiculous love story. The world is flooded with novels of every description.

Oh! that the young would reflect upon the influence the exciting story-reading has upon the mind.",
