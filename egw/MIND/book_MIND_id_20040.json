    "word": "Peter was not pleased to listen to the words of Christ, for what He said was contrary to the expectation of the Jewish nation. They had been instructed that Christ was to reign as a temporal prince on David's throne, and break from off them the Roman yoke which brought them into subjection as a people to a nation which they despised. Although Christ from time to time had striven to impress their minds with the idea that His kingdom was not a temporal, earthly kingdom, but a spiritual, heavenly kingdom, they could not comprehend His teachings, and really believe His words. The priests and the scribes had often declared that Christ was to come in glory. The description that applied to His second coming, they applied to His first advent, and therefore their statements were false. They gave utterance to the very suggestions of Satan.",
