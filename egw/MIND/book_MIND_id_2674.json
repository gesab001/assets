    "word": "The Students to Cooperate \n\n     Some will say, \"We shall have fewer students.\" This may be; but those that you do have will appreciate their time, and see the necessity of diligent work to qualify them for the positions they must fill. If the Lord is kept ever before the students as the One to whom they should look for counsel, like Daniel, they will receive of Him knowledge and wisdom. All will then become channels of light. Lay the matter before the students themselves. Inquire who of them will practice self-denial and make sacrifice to cancel the debt already incurred. With some students only the willing mind is needed. \n                                                                           271",
