    "word": "A Son's Interference. [THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN JULY 28, 1902, TO THE SON OF ELDER GEORGE I. BUTLER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE. ELDER BUTLER'S WIFE DIED NOVEMBER 15, 1901, LEAVING HIM A WIDOWER AT THE AGE OF 68. AS A RESULT OF HIS SON'S INFLUENCE, ELDER BUTLER DID NOT MARRY THE WOMAN REFERRED TO IN THIS LETTER. FIVE YEARS LATER, IN 1907, HE MARRIED SOMEONE ELSE.] I beg of you not to reproach your father. You should not feel as you do, for your father has done nothing that God condemns. His condemnation exists only in the minds of men. He has in no wise dishonored his children. He is keeping the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment. The Lord is opening the way before him, that he may do a great and good work for His people. Christ is his Saviour, and in beholding Christ he will be changed into His image.",
