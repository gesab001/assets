    "word": "Many youth who have but little experience push themselves forward, manifest no reverence for age or office, and take offense if counseled or reproved.  We have already more of these self-important ones than we want.  God calls for modest, quiet, sober-minded youth, and men of mature age, who are well-balanced with principle, who can pray as well as talk, who will rise up before the aged, and treat gray hairs with respect.  -- RH Nov. 13, 1883.",
