    "word": "The opening hymn, \"Sweet be thy rest,\" and the Scripture reading by Elder E. W. Farnsworth (1 Corinthians 15:12-20, 35-38, 42-45; 2 Corinthians 4:6-18; 5:1-10), prepared the minds of the congregation to enter into the spirit of Elder Loughborough's invocation, in the course of which he acknowledged that \"while afflictions \n                                                                           457\ncome upon us, and while workers in this cause may lay down the armor because  of lack of physical strength,\" yet God's purpose will be accomplished. When the Saviour was laid away, it was thought by His disciples that His work on earth was at an end; but His death on the cross was in reality the very life of the cause He had advocated.",
