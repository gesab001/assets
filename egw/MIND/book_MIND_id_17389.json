    "word": "Chap. 4 - To Physicians and Ministers\n\n\n                   Sanitarium, Cal., August 10, 1905. \nTo Our Ministers and Physicians in the Colorado \n     Conference: \n\n\n     I bear a message to you from the Lord. Walk in all humility of mind, and do not in thought or word or act grieve the Saviour. Do not in any way misrepresent His character. The work that we are now to do has been laid out before me. We are to press together. We are to unify. We are to relieve if possible the embarrassments of the institutions that are laboring under a pressure of debt. Our sanitariums are to be helped. The Lord will be honored if you will use your zeal in lifting the burden of debt from the medical institutions already established. Thus you will give evidence that you desire to carry out the purposes of God.",
