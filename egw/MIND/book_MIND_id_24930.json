    "word": "The new theories in regard to God and Christ, as brought out in \"The Living Temple\", are not in harmony with the teaching of Christ. The Lord Jesus came to this world to represent the Father. He did not represent God as an essence pervading nature, but as a personal being. Christians should bear in mind that God has a personality as verily as has Christ.",
