    "word": "The hope which had been so precious to them lost its attractions; for the specious delusions of Satan almost wholly extinguished the light of salvation through the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour, and men were led to seek to make an atonement through works of their own,--by fasts and penances, and through the payment of money to the church. It was more agreeable to the natural heart thus to seek justification than to seek it through repentance and faith, through belief in, and obedience to, the truth. During the ages of apostasy, darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Reformation aroused the inhabitants of earth from their death-like slumber, and many turned away from their vanities and superstitions, from priests and penances, to serve the living God, to search in his holy word for truth as for hidden treasure. They began diligently to work the mine of truth, to clear away the rubbish of human opinion that had buried up the precious jewels of light. But as soon as the work of reformation began. Satan with determined purpose sought the more zealously to bind the minds of men in superstition and error. When he found that he could not prevent them from investigating the word of God, or deter them from accepting the truth, through forcing erroneous doctrines upon their attention, he thought to intimidate them by threatening and persecution, and thus to quench the heavenly light that was shining upon men, revealing the character of God, and making manifest the malignity of the arch deceiver.",
