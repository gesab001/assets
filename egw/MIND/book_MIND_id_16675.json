    "word": "Chap. 26 - Love and Kindness\n\n     Kind, Comforting Words--When poor, wounded, bruised souls come to you for words of hope, you are to speak to them the words of Christ. Do you refuse to give them pleasant, courteous, kind words? Those who speak as Christ spoke will never plant bitter words like barbed arrows in the wounded soul. \"The Lord hearkened and heard.\" Will you bear in mind that the Lord hears the words we speak, and is acquainted with the spirit that prompts our actions? . . . Is it not Christlike to speak kind words, comforting words, even though you feel inclined to do otherwise?--RH May 26, 1896.",
