    "word": "The purity and holiness of entire consecration to God, entire conformity to His mind, His Spirit, His will, is essential, You need not be ever dwelling on doctrinal subjects but on that character all must have in order to please and glorify God. Do not be afraid that you will lose your influence. No one who is balanced by the Holy Spirit of God, who moves considerately, who sits with Christ in heavenly places, will lose the influence of any person, high or low, whose influence is worth having. You need never try to shape your religious experience in order that you may be a great man before the world. Your greatness depends upon your humility.",
