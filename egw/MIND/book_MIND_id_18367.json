    "word": "\"If those who now view matters with perverted vision had talked constantly with God, pleading with Him for grace and guidance, they would have followed a different course. They would have called to mind their own experience in a new field, and would have striven to establish more firmly that which had been established. As they learned Christ's lessons, they would have become meek and lowly and humble, and they would have been partakers of His loving-kindness and His unselfish regard for others. But without a kind, loving regard for those who have as deep an interest as themselves in the cause of God, who have at heart the needs of suffering humanity, how can men serve God acceptably? How can they adjust matters in a way that will glorify Him? Those who are striving to obey the word, 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,' will not hurt the souls of Christ's purchased possession.\"",
