    "word": "Oct. 17, 1903, in a letter addressed \"To our medical missionaries\" (B-241-'03) we find the following: \"God would have all who profess to be gospel medical missionaries, learn diligently the lessons of the great Teacher. . . . The one book that is essential for all to study is the Bible. Studied with reverence and Godly fear, it is the greatest of all educators. . . Study the Bible more and the theories of the medical fraternities, less, and you will have greater spiritual health. Your mind will be clearer and more vigorous. Much that is embraced in the medical course is positively unnecessary. Those who take a medical training, spend a great deal of time in learning that which is merely rubbish. Many of the theories that they learn may be compared in value to the traditions and maxims taught by the scribes and pharisees. Many of the intricacies with which they have to become familiar are an injury to their minds. These things God has been opening before me for many years. In our medical schools and institutions, we need men who have a deeper knowledge of the scriptures. . . . Because the word of God has been neglected, strange things have (733) been done in our medical missionary work of late. The Lord can not accept the present showing.\"",
