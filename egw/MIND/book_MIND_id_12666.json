    "word": "Educate, Educate, Educate.--Because the principles of health and temperance are so important, and are so often misunderstood, neglected, or unknown, we should educate ourselves, that we may not only bring our own lives into harmony with these principles, but teach them to others.

The mind must be enlightened and the conscience aroused to the duty of practicing the principles of true reform.",
