    "word": "We must not allow our faith to decrease; it must continually increase. Repeat to yourself the words, \"The Lord is my keeper.\" Put your trust in Him. Call to mind the love He has shown you, the care He has had for you, the assurance you have had in the past that He has accepted you and blessed you. He is not only the author, but the finisher of your faith. Again and again your case has been presented to me as of one who is cared for and guarded against the power of the enemy by heavenly intelligences.",
