    "word": "Mingling of Sacred and Common. \n\n     31. There is such a mingling of the sacred and the common in the work at the office that much of the sacredness of the work of God has been lost from the minds of the workers. The subject matter that some are handling is of such a character that their attention is arrested, and their mind engaged, and the cheap, objectionable sentences are fastening upon the memory; and before they know it, they are influenced by the spirit of the writer, and their mind and character are fashioned in some objectionable mould. There are souls who have connected with the office who are weak in faith, weak in the power of self-control; and through the influence of such publications, a train of thought is started that will be difficult to repress and expel from the mind. Before they embraced the truth, they had formed the habit of reading light and trifling literature; and after uniting with the church, they made efforts to overcome this taste for novels and story-books. To introduce to \n                                                                           46\nthis class, books that are not in harmony with the sacred work of God, is like putting the glass to the lips of the inebriate. With the temptation continually before them, they yield, and become interested in that which they discarded, and lose their relish for solid reading, and for Bible study, which is positively essential to the health of the soul. Through the influence of this kind of reading, moral power is enfeebled, dishonesty and crime do not appear so repulsive, discernment and sanctified perception are lost, and unfaithfulness in little things is increased. When the appetite of the mind is perverted, these poor souls will grasp any kind of reading that has a stimulating influence.",
