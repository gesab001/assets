    "word": "MR No. 1114 - The Influence of Evil Business Associates; Practice the Principles of the Word; God is Gracious and Forgiving\n\n     (Written June 26, 1902, from Elmshaven, St. Helena, California, to an Adventist businessman.) \n\n\n     I am much distressed in your behalf. I desire so much to see you in the spiritual condition that Christ told Nicodemus he must be in. The words that Christ addressed to him I address to you, \"Ye must be born again.\" When you are born again, everything you do will be done with an eye single to the glory of God. You will work with all humility of mind, and in thorough distrust of self. You have valuable traits of character which, when your heart is sanctified, will make you a useful Christian.",
