    "word": "I entreat you to open the door of your heart and let your Saviour in. Give Him the whole heart--that which He has purchased. Ever bear in mind that it is you who must choose. God forces no man. He has chosen you, and engraven your name in the palms of His hands. Will you not give yourself fully to Him? Time is short. You have not a moment to lose in hesitation. The divine Word is in your hands, to be a lamp to your feet and a light to your path.--Letter 21a, Jan. 11, 1893, to N. D. Faulkhead, treasurer of the Echo Publishing House, and at the time involved with secret societies.",
