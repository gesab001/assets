    "word": "Having Our Conversation In Heaven\n\n(Sermon by Ellen G. White in Copenhagen, Denmark, July 24, 1886)\n\n     1 Peter 1:13-16. The apostle Peter here gives instruction for believers to gird up the loins of their minds. We are to have special care over the thoughts of the mind. We are not to allow our minds to be diverted and allured by different things, because there is something more important for us. If we would allow the mind to take its natural turn, it might dwell upon unimportant things and we receive no benefit thereby.",
