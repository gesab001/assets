    "word": "Elder Rice and those who advocate this new source of supposed revelation have not sent a line to me, nor asked me for a word of counsel. They have withheld everything from me, although they are making so much of this matter. Why have they kept this matter so secret? I have given no special attention to this before, because I had confidence in our ministering brethren, and thought they would not catch up such a matter without the most thorough evidence that the Lord had chosen one through whom to work. The spurious and the counterfeit are in the field, and minds must be under the constant control of the Spirit of God in order to detect the counterfeit from the genuine.",
