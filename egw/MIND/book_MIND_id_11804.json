    "word": "There were many fishermen in the assembly that listened to the teachings of Jesus; and therefore he spoke a parable that would bring his truth directly home to their minds by an illustration drawn from their daily lives. Said he, \"Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind. Which, when it was full, they drew to shore and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. So shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\" Here again the separation of the wicked from the righteous at the end of the world is impressed upon the minds of his hearers, in words that cannot be mistaken.",
