    "word": "How disappointed is your Saviour in you in that you allow your self to be governed by your own wayward fancies. How hard it is for you, in your own finite wisdom, to rightly explain or understand what is moral truth. Your exactions are not just or right. The Lord weighs all our actions. O that you could have a knowledge of your own wayward heart, before it is too late for wrongs to be righted. Your mind is tossed to and fro. Your fears and conflicts are continual. The word of God tells you that you are bought with a price, that you are not your own. Through the sacrifice of Christ, you are made the living temple, not of the world, but of your Father which is in heaven. Who will be your consolation when through your own choice and course of action, you will have severed the last link that binds you to God and to your brethren? There is reward and forgiveness with God, and if you now humble your heart as a little child before him, he will receive you. \"At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them and said, Verily, I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall \n                                                                           1655\nhumble himself as a little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a mill stone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea. Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe unto that man by whom the offence cometh.",
