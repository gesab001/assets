    "word": "In dealing with minds, be very careful to reveal Christ. Make your apprentices understand that they are a part of the firm. Say to them, \"We want you to cooperate with Christ. As you do this, you will work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for God will work in you, to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Do nothing that will lead the apprentices to feel that they have not been treated right. This feeling corrodes in the mind, and the impression is never lost.",
