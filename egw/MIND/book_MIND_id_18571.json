    "word": "Men should be chosen to stand at the head of our institutions who have not only good, sound judgment, but a high moral tone, who will be circumspect in their deportment, pure in speech, remembering their high and holy calling, and that there is a Watcher, a true Witness to every word and act. Those who give evidence that their thoughts run in a low channel, whose conversation tends to corrupt rather than to elevate, should be removed at once from any connection with the institution; for they will surely demoralize others. Ever bear in mind that our institutions are missionary fields. God's eye is upon them day and night. No one should feel at liberty to allow even the appearance of evil. Let all be \n\n\n                   -15- \n\ncircumspect, for the Lord will certainly judge you for any wrong influence exerted in any one of His instrumentalities.",
