    "word": "There are many who need now to consider the words, \"TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting\" (Daniel 5:27). God's holy, everlasting, immutable law is the standard by which man is to be tried. This law defines what we shall do and what we shall not do, saying, Thou shalt, and, Thou shalt not. This law is summed up in the two great principles, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself\" (Luke 10:27).",
