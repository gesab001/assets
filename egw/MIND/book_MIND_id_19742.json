    "word": "God desires His workers to take counsel together. Be subject one to another, but do not hold back in weakness and indecision, failing to do what needs to be done. Do not act an undecided, indefinite part. Make up your minds what needs to be done, and move steadily forward in the doing of it. Do not take one backward step. Show those with whom you come in contact that they are to work out their own salvation with holy boldness, and at the same time with fear and trembling, lest they fail to fulfill God's purpose for them.",
