    "word": "N. D. Faulkhead and the Secret Sign\n     Brother Faulkhead called to see me. The burden of his case was upon my mind. I told him that I had a message for him and his wife, which I had several times prepared to send them, but I had felt forbidden by the Spirit of the Lord to do so. I asked him to appoint a time when I could see them. He answered, \u201cI am glad that you did not send me a written communication; I would rather have the message from your lips; had it come in another way I do not think it would have done me any good.\u201d He then asked, \u201cWhy not give me the message now?\u201d I said, \u201cCan you remain to hear it?\u201d He replied that he would do so.",
