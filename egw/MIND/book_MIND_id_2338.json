    "word": "Mammoth Sanitariums Not a Necessity \n\n\n     I have been repeatedly shown that it is not wise to erect mammoth institutions. It is not by the largeness of an institution that the greatest work for souls is to be accomplished. A mammoth sanitarium requires many workers. And where so many are brought together, it is exceedingly difficult to maintain a high standard of spirituality. In a large institution it often happens that responsible places are filled by workers who are not spiritual-minded, who do not exercise wisdom in dealing with those who, if wisely treated, would be awakened, convicted, and converted.",
