    "word": "Evil doctrines will be accumulated by the publication of seductive fallacies. To make these fallacies the subject of discourse is to put into the minds of many thoughts that would never have been there had not these errors been brought out before them. Let the youth be taught to shun publications dealing with this subject. Do not print one article with it, for you cannot without loss enter into these things. Thus seed is sown that will spring up and bring forth tares.",
