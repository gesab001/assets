    "word": "There are many rich men upon whom God has had His searching eye during their lifetime. He has seen in all their worldly acquirements a robbery of Him. They have been laying up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath because they have not relieved the oppressed, because they have neglected the great Proprietor of all. In coming to His vineyard to receive the fruit thereof, He has received only abuse. This robbery of their Lord's goods has continued. These men worship themselves, not God. Every unfaithful steward will surely supplant and intrigue. He will put justice and mercy out of his mind, replacing it with avarice and strife. God says, \"Shall I not judge for these things? I love righteousness, but hate iniquity.\"",
