    "word": "You are inclined to catch hold of some minor matter which you \n     consider important, and place great weight upon it. At such times \n     Satan is waiting and watching for an opportunity to influence your \n     mind, and through you to work upon many other minds, leading them \n     to questioning and doubt. The Lord has not called you to such a work \n     as this. Upon some questions silence will reveal a spirit of wisdom \n     and discretion. (Letter 166, 1908)",
