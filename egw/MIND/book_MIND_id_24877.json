    "word": "Of all the trees, the Scotch fir-tree is one of the best from which Christians may draw inspiring lessons. The Scotch fir requires less soil for its roots than any other tree. In a dry soil and amidst barren rocks it finds sufficient nourishment to keep it as green in the winter as in the summer. With the least amount of earth about its roots, it towers above all the other trees of the wood, reaching the highest toward heaven. It would be well for us to plant and cultivate the Scotch fir; for this tree is an object lesson, bring to the minds of all what a Christian should be.",
