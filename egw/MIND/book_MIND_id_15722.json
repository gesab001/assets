    "word": "His parents listened in amazement as they heard His searching inquiries. . . . Though taking the attitude of a learner, Christ imparted light in every word He uttered.

The sharp, clear questions of the child learner brought a flood of light to their darkened understanding. The truth shone out as the clear shining of a light in a darkened place, as He received and imparted the knowledge of the plan of salvation.",
