    "word": "We should be deeply impressed with the humility of Christ as His experience, in coming to this world, is brought before our minds. To save men and women, He descended to the lowest depths of humiliation; but in this He was untainted with sin. He came to our world to uplift fallen human beings, and He allowed no reproach, no hardship to turn Him from His work. His true missionaries are willing to work in the hardest places if thereby they can reach souls.",
