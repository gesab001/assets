    "word": "7, 16-18 (Joshua 6:2-5). God's Ways Are Not Our Ways.--It is a dangerous thing for men to resist the Spirit of truth and grace and righteousness, because its manifestations are not according to their ideas, and have not come in the line of their methodical plans. The Lord works in His own way, and according to His own devising. Let men pray that they may be divested of self, and may be in harmony with heaven. Let them pray, \"Not my will, but thine, O God, be done.\" Let men bear in mind that God's ways are not their ways, nor His thoughts their thoughts; for He says, \"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.\" In the instruction that the Lord gave Gideon when he was about to fight with the Midianites,--that he should go out against his foes with an army of three hundred blowing trumpets, and carrying empty pitchers in their hands, and shouting, \"The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon,\"--these precise, methodical, formal men would see nothing but inconsistency and confusion. They would start back with determined protest and resistance. They would have held long controversies to show the inconsistency and the dangers that would accompany the carrying on of the warfare in such an extreme way, and in their finite judgment they would pronounce all such movements as utterly ridiculous and unreasonable. How unscientific, how inconsistent, would they have thought the movements of Joshua and his army at the taking of Jericho! (RH May 5, 1896).",
