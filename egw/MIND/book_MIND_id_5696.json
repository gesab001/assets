    "word": "Chapter XXII. - Exercise.\n\nGeneral Statements. \n     557. The human body may be compared to nicely adjusted machinery, which needs care to keep it in running order. One part should not be subjected to constant wear and pressure, while another part is rusting from inaction. While the mind is taxed, the muscles also should have their proportion of exercise. Every young person should learn how many hours may be spent in study, and how much time should be given to physical exercise.-- S. of T., 1886, No. 33.",
