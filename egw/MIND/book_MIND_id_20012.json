    "word": "The past night has been a very long one, and I am so restless that I long for the day. I keep my mind as much as possible on the promises of God. I do not claim these promises because I deserve them, but because they are bestowed upon erring human beings as a free gift. I am comforted with the assurance that although constantly suffering pain, I am never forsaken. I put my trust in One who is too wise to err and too good to do me harm. He will restore me to health. I shall yet speak forth His praise in the congregation of the saints. I am determined not to encourage feelings of despondency and gloom. . . .",
