    "word": "Other health institutions are looking with a jealous eye upon the Health Institute at Battle Creek. They work from a worldling's standpoint, while the managers of the Health Institute work from a religious standpoint, acknowledging God as their proprietor. They do not labor selfishly for means alone; but for humanity's sake, and for Christ's sake. The managers of our Health Institute are seeking to benefit suffering humanity, to heal the diseased mind, as well as the suffering body, by directing invalids to Christ, the sinners' friend. They do not leave religion out of the question, but make God their trust and dependence. The sick are directed to Jesus. After the physicians have done what they can in behalf of the sick, they ask God to work with their efforts, and restore the suffering invalids to health. This he has done in some cases in answer to the prayer of faith. And this he will continue to do, if they are faithful, and put their trust in him. The Health Institute will be a success; for God sustains it. And if his blessing attends the Institutes it will prosper and be \n                                                                           53\nthe means of doing a great amount of good. Other institutions are aware that a high standard of moral and religious influence exists at our Institute. And they see that its conductors are not actuated by selfish, worldly principles, and they are jealous in regard to its commanding and leading influence. \n                        Ellen G. White.",
