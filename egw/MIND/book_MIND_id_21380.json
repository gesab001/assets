    "word": "The householder is designed to represent God: the husbandmen the Jewish nation, whom God had appointed to cultivate His vineyard, the world. The servants whom God sent to receive the fruits of the vineyard were the prophets and teachers through whom God had called Israel to render to Him His dues. Had God's professed people been heeding the word of the Lord, it would not have been necessary to remind them of this and call them to a sense of their responsibility. But they had become selfish and covetous, and they were systematically robbing Him of the means and facilities He had entrusted to them for the carrying on of His work.",
