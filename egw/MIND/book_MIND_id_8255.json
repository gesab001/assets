    "word": "The Great Counselor.--Come to God with all your needs. Don't go to others with your trials and temptations; God alone can help you. If you fulfill the conditions of God's promises, the promises will be fulfilled to you. If your mind is stayed upon God, you will not go from a state of ecstasy to the valley of despondency when trial and temptation come upon you. You will not talk doubt and gloom to others. You will not say, \"I do not know about this or that. I do not feel happy. I am not sure that we have the truth.\" You will not do this, for you will have an anchor to the soul both sure and steadfast.",
