    "word": "27\n \n     The Right Use of Authority--I wish to speak to my brethren who occupy positions of trust.  As God's husbandry you are invested with the responsibility of acting in His stead, as His helping hand. Those who are placed in positions of trust must have the authority of action, but they are never to use this authority as a power to refuse help to the needy and helpless.  It is never to be exercised to discourage or depress one struggling soul.  Let those to given positions of influence ever remember them to carry out the mind of Christ, who, by creation and redemption, is the owner of all men.--Letter 7, 1901 (Jan. 17, 1901 To Brethren Who Occupy Positions of Trust).",
