    "word": "Those who bring self into their work cannot be trusted. If they would lose sight of self in Christ, their efforts would be of value to His cause. They would then conform the life to His teachings. They would form their plans in harmony with His great plan of love. Selfishness would be banished from their efforts. . . . Self-denial, humility of mind, nobility of purpose, marked the Saviour's life . . . [Matthew 16:24 quoted] (MS 2, 1903).",
