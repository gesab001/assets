    "word": "The teachers have a task which few appreciate. If they succeed in reforming these wayward youth, they receive but little credit.

They had the first and most favorable opportunity to control and train their children, when the spirit was teachable, and the mind and heart were easily impressed. But through the slothfulness of the parents, the children are permitted to follow their own will, until they become hardened in an evil course.",
