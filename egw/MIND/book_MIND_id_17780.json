    "word": "You do not know how much influence the Lord places behind this book. You do not know how He speaks through it to the hearts and minds of men and women. But you may know that you are doing the work He wishes you to do. I know that I did what He wanted me to do in giving this book to our schools, and I have been happy ever since. You will be happy if you do His will, and when you see how unbelievers appreciate the work, it will make your heart leap for joy. It will make the yoke easy, and the burden light. God will help you to work intelligently.",
