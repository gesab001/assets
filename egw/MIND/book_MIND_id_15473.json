    "word": "Much has been lost through following the mistaken ideas of some of our good brethren. Their plans were narrow, and they lowered the work to their peculiar ways and ideas so that the higher classes were not reached.

Much also has been lost through want of wise methods of labour. Every effort should be made to give dignity and character to the work. Special efforts should be made to secure the goodwill of men in responsible positions, not by sacrificing even one principle of truth or righteousness, but by simply giving up our own ways and manner of approaching the people.",
