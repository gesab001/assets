    "word": "This matter grieves my soul, because it grieves the soul of him who died for us, that we should be one in him and one in God. I have great respect and love for you, my brother, and it hurts me to see you in any way taking a course that in the least resembles the course pursued by the Jewish nation, which separated them from God and bound up their minds in prejudice and unbelief, that the true light shining all about them was not discovered and acknowledged. I have had the deepest interest in Elder Butler. You know how he decidedly refused to listen to anything I might say, because he was deceived and blinded by reports that had no foundation in truth. You were influenced in the same way. Both of you have had evidence that the Lord was still using Sister White as he had done; this has had some influence with you, but not enough with Elder Butler to lead him to retract one thing he has said and done to counteract my influence. Now the Lord is acquainted with this whole matter. There is pride of heart, there is prejudice, there is resistance to the Spirit of God, and this crops out on every occasion where there is a chance.",
