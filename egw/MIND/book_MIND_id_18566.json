    "word": "If those who hold positions of trust are persons who love and fear God, they will realize that a sacred responsibility is theirs, because of the measure of authority and the consequent influence which their position gives them. They are dealing with varied minds and they should move discreetly, for they are representatives of the institution. They should be kind and courteous, manifesting Christian politeness towards all with whom they are brought in contact, both believers and unbelievers. Brethren, you are to represent \n\n\n                 -6- \n\nthe family of the heavenly King. You are to watch for souls as they that must give an account. We should never forget that Jesus, in the infinite sacrifice that He has made, has proved His love for every man, woman and child: He has shown what value He places upon every soul. All have been purchased by the price of His own blood.",
