    "word": "Now, Bro. Fargo, if you did go from that conference and make such statements to Elder Butler, have you had no evidence to change you mind? and how could you represent this as you did to Elder. B. who was broken in mind and diseased in body, who was in a condition to exaggerate every statement made? How can God look upon this work of my good ministering brethren? If you have acted a part because of blindness of mind in helping Eld. Butler to remain under a deception, making statements to him which his diseased imagination would construe into the worst possible light, God will not look on this work with any favor, for if this, your work, is of God, then He has not been leading me. Did not you see enough at that meeting if your mind had not been wrongly impressed by the prevailing leaven at work in that meeting at Minneapolis to know that God was not with those who were so stirred up over the Law in Galatians? Did you not have evidence that the Spirit that controlled at that meeting was not the spirit of Jesus? What evidence had you or any one at that meeting that I was changed in my relation to the work of God and what did you perceive in my speaking to the people when the testimonies God had given me were of a different order and character than they had been? When I came to Potterville I bore the same testimonies. Wherein did you distinguish in the message I bore, an uncertain sound that would lead you to suppose it was not the voice of the true Shepherd through His humble messenger?",
