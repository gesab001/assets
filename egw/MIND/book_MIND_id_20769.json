    "word": "Do not be anxious to make a great figure in the world, for if you do you will make a small one. You must feel your need of richer blessings than temporal ones. Serve the Lord heartily; gather to yourself the sunshine of Christ's countenance. You are responsible for the impression you leave upon the minds of those with whom you are brought in contact. In seeking any temporal advancement, your faith in holy, sacred truth will impose upon you moderation of desire and repress all inordinate ambition. Do not allow ambition for greatness to make you indifferent to goodness.",
