    "word": "(1025) During my wakeful hours through the night season, I have been pleading with the Lord to guard our brethren against the tendency to promise to go here or there on the stipulation that they are to have a little higher wage. If they go in a spirit of self-sacrificing, trusting in Him, the Lord will grant sustaining power to mind and character, and success will be the result.",
