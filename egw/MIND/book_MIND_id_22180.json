    "word": "Our individual influence is proportionate to the position we occupy and the work we are doing. Those who acted a part in robbing the Southern field had every facility--buildings, machinery, and workers--yet they could take \"the one ewe lamb,\" and let consequences and results take care of themselves. What does it mean? Were these men controlled by the Holy Spirit? God holds responsible those who by pen or voice acted a part in diverting His means from the field for which it was raised. In heart, mind, and soul they were controlled by covetousness. Covetousness is idolatry, and no idolater will enter the kingdom of heaven.",
