    "word": "Marian, you have been united with me to bring sound doctrine into actual contact with human souls, that they may catch the inspiration and produce sound practice. \"The form of sound words\" is to be prized above gold and silver and every earthly attraction. You have loved the truth. You have felt intensely over the great neglect our Lord and Saviour has been receiving. Oh, to be like-minded with God! This you have longed for. There is no genuine saving elevation for man apart from the truth of God.",
