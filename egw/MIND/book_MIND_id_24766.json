    "word": "Individually, you should realize that you are in the presence of the unseen Watcher. Your methods and your temperaments need to be fashioned after the divine pattern. Constantly you should cherish the thought, I am in the presence of the One whom I love and fear and reverence. I must think no thought and do no action in my own spirit or after my own inclination. Unless I have the mind and the spirit of God, I can not be safely entrusted with sacred responsibilities. My own mind, my own judgment, must not rule. It is the mind and judgment of the great I AM that must bear rule.",
