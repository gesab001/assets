    "word": "Preparation for the Work \n\n     The followers of Jesus are not meeting the mind and will of God, if they are content to remain in ignorance of His Word. All should become Bible students. Christ commanded His followers, \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.\" Peter exhorts us, \"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.\"--Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 633, 634.",
