    "word": "The Lord has shown me that you employ human and mesmeric influence to move upon minds. In your labors it is often the case that that which is attributed to divine power is from a human source; you yourself have at times been amazed that your brethren and sisters should regard you as moved by the power of God. You are deceiving, and being deceived. . . . You serve yourself, and attract the people to yourself. Your brethren and sisters are certainly deceived in you.--Letter 8, 1889.",
