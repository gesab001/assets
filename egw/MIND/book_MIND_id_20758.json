    "word": "Nothing Can Be Added to the Argument of the Cross--\"It is Christ that died\" is an argument that cannot be refuted. To it nothing can be added. To the repentant soul it is Yea and Amen. Christ leads the penitent soul upward step by step, and gives to the mind His peace. \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9). Angels of God guard the penitent, believing soul, that evil angels may not intrude.--Letter 271, 1904, p. 3. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, July 29, 1904.)",
