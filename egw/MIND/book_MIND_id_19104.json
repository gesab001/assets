    "word": "We need intelligent canvassers, who are also evangelists, canvassers who will do all the good they possibly can as they visit from house to house. Canvassers may do a good work for God. The Lord has given great light to the world in the books Great Controversy, Patriarchs and Prophets, and Desire of Ages. These books should be pressed in everywhere. Those who handle these books should educate themselves for the work. As canvassers dwell upon the precious truths contained in these books, seeking to get the light before as many as possible, they are letting the light shine into many minds, and they may say, We then, as workers together with Him, beseech you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.",
