    "word": "The seed sown by Christ in His mission work with His disciples needed no other evidence than that the words spoken by the disciples found entrance to \n\n\n                                     -17- \n\ntheir minds and hearts, and through these mighty agencies the world was to be convinced of sin. Bear in mind, when heavenly influences came into the heart all found a field ready to be harvested. Particular fields of labor were opened to be worked, and all found, wherever they went in Christ's name, His representative in the Holy Spirit opened the hearts and doors for the disciples. All were of one mind, and all felt that their resources must be taxed to the uttermost of their ability. A work was before them to preach Christ and Him crucified through the whole world. One subject was the theme for all who should work with completeness the works of Christ as His representatives to all, as many as would believe on Him. They were of one heart and one mind, and daily they were adding new territories as their fields of labor.--Ms 130, 1901, pp. 14, 15. (No title, Nov. 27, 1901.)",
