    "word": "Christ Our Source of Strength\n     In every crowd that gathered about Jesus, there were souls hungering and thirsting for light and knowledge. The truths that came from the lips of the Divine Teacher were wholly unlike the traditions and dogmas taught by the rabbis. There was a freshness, a life and vigor, in his sayings; they came home to the mind with a clearness and power that captivated his hearers. God's workers are to learn the same manner of teaching. They are to bring to men truths full of fragrance, like fresh flowers from the garden of God's word.",
