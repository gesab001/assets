    "word": "Man has a body as well as a soul to save. Both are to be restored to health by God's simple but efficacious methods, which appeal to men and women of intelligence. \n                                                                           118\nThrough a belief in the truth souls are awakened to a need of a preparation for life's duties. As the health of the body is restored the powers of the mind are put forth to grasp the great truths of the gospel.--Letter 152, 1901.",
