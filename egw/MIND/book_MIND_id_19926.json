    "word": "Gain a knowledge of the Scriptures. Do not fill the head with the nonsense of novels. Brain nerve-power is required by those who desire to comprehend the truth so clearly that they can teach it intelligently to others. We have none too much brain-power. Never can we afford to use tobacco, or alcoholic liquors, or any other injurious substances; for we must strive to keep our minds clear for the work of saving souls.--Ms 102, 1904, pp. 9, 10. (Sermon, July 2, 1904.)",
