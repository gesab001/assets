    "word": "Again: \"Study the Bible more, and the theories of the medical fraternities less, and you will have greater spiritual health. Your mind will be clearer and more vigorous. Much that is embraced (775) in the medical course is positively unnecessary. Those who take a medical training, spend a great deal of time in learning that which is merely rubbish. Many of the theories that they learn may be compared in value to the traditions and maxims taught by the scribes and pharisees. Many of the intricacies with which they have to become familiar are an injury to their minds. These things God has been opening before me for many years.\" Instruction to Medical Missionaries, Oct. 17, 1903. (B-241-03)",
