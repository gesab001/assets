    "word": "The saving knowledge of God will accomplish its purifying work on the mind and heart of every believer. The Word declares: \"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put My spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes\" [Ezekiel 36:25-27]. This is the descent of the Holy Spirit, sent from God to do its office-work. The house of Israel is to be imbued with the Holy Spirit, and baptized with the grace of salvation. Their state of lethargy will no longer exist. All who have not received the light will be convicted; all who will turn unto the Lord with full purpose of heart will confess their sins. . . .",
