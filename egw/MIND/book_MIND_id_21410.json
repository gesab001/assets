    "word": "I have been shown that our ministers go too rapidly through their subjects and bring the most objectionable features of our faith too early into their effort. There are truths that will not involve so great a cross, that should be kept before their minds day after day and even weeks before the Sabbath and immortality questions are entered into. Then you gain the confidence of the people as being men who have clear, forcible arguments, \n\n\n                                       -68- \n\nand they think you understand the Scriptures. When once the confidence of the people is gained, then it is time enough to introduce the Sabbath and immortality questions. But men who are not wise advance these questions too soon, and thus close the ears of the people, when with greater care and more faith and aptness and wisdom they could have carried them along step by step through the important events in the prophecies and in dwelling upon practical subjects in the teachings of Christ.",
