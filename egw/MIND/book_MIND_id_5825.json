    "word": "If we believe in God, we are armed with the righteousness of Christ; we have taken hold of his strength. The promise is, \u201cLet him take hold of my \n133\nstrength, that he may make peace with me, and he shall make peace with me.\u201d We want to talk with our Saviour as though he were right by our side. We should have our minds stayed upon him. We should hold communion with him while we walk by the way, and while our hands are engaged in labor. If you will do this, you will not dishonor your Redeemer by talking to every one about your darkness and unworthiness. Go, tell it to Jesus; and he will lift up for you a standard against the enemy, and will cause the light of joy and gladness to come into your hearts.",
