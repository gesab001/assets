    "word": "The highest aim of our youth should not be to strain after something novel, but to place themselves under the teaching of the Holy Scriptures.

They will hide themselves in God, and in all their teaching will simplify the original truth so that it will not appear strange but familiar to other minds. They will weave it into their daily thoughts and practical life.",
