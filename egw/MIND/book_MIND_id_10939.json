    "word": "Prayer and almsgiving are closely linked together--the expression of love to God and to our fellow men. They are the out-working of the two great principles of the divine law, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength\"; and, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" Thus while our gifts cannot recommend us to God or earn His favor, they are an evidence that we have received the grace of Christ. They are a test of the sincerity of our profession of love (RH May 9, 1893).",
