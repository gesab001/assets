    "word": "The work in Greater New York is to be carried on in a way that will properly represent the sacredness and holiness of the truth of God. Vegetarian restaurants, treatment rooms, cooking schools, are to be established. The people are to be taught how to prepare wholesome food. They are to be shown the need of discarding tea, coffee, and flesh-meat. There are to be suitably furnished rooms, where people can be received and given religious instruction. These things are necessary for the advancement of the work. The work is not to be carried on in such a self-sacrificing way that an unfavorable impression will be made on the minds of the people, because of its meager showing. All that is done is to bear favorable witness to the Author of truth. The worship of God in the beauty of holiness demands a dignity and nicety that is in harmony with the sacredness and importance of the truth.--Letter 49, 1902, pp. 4,5,8,10-12. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, February 5, 1902.) \n\nWhite Estate, Washington, D. C. March 3, 1980",
