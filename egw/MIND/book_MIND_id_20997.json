    "word": "Brother Andrews, you can so educate your mind as to bring out the energies of the soul and develop every faculty, that they may accomplish the purpose for which they were given. The intellect may be strengthened by every faculty being exercised. You, my brother, are not doing the greatest amount of good, because you exercise the intellect in one direction but neglect to give careful attention to these things for which you think you are not adapted; therefore, some faculties that are weak are lying dormant for want of exercise, because the work that should call them into exercise and consequently give them strength, is not pleasant to you.",
