    "word": "Chap. 4 - Spiritual Influences and the Mind\n-\n\n     Religion and Health.--Personal religion is of the highest importance. John wrote to Gaius, \"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth\" (3 John 2). Health of body depends largely upon health of soul; therefore whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God. Personal religion is revealed by the deportment, the words, and the actions. It causes growth, till at last perfection claims the commendation of the Lord, \"Ye are complete in Him\" (Colossians 2:10)--Lt 117, 1901.",
