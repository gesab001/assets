    "word": "Chapter Thirty-Two - Cautions Sounded\n\n     Slum Work Not to Be Glamorized.--Precautions must be taken in this last work that mortals shall undertake. There is danger of so working upon the imagery of the mind that persons who are wholly unfitted to engage in the sacred work of God will consider themselves appointed by Heaven to work for the outcast and fallen. If all the experiences, pleasant and unpleasant were depicted, there would not be so many drawn to this class of work. Many enter the work because they love that which is sensational and exciting. But unless they throw all their energies into this grand, soul-saving work, they reveal that they have not the true missionary spirit.--Manuscript 177, 1899.",
