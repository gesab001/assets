    "word": "In establishing sanitarium work in Washington, do not link up with Dr. Kellogg. Let the plans laid for the carrying forward of this line of work be such as will bear the endorsement of heaven. In no case is this line of work to be made secondary. It is to be prominent in bringing the truth to the minds of the people. With great wisdom establish a sanitarium in Washington. Establish the work upon a solid foundation. Let the building be neat and tasty, but not expensive. We can not afford to erect an expensive building. The Lord desires this building to be a representation of what He designs all His sanitariums to be.",
