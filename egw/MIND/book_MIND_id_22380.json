    "word": "Tuesday, March 6, 1906, Sanitarium, California, Ellen White to the Brethren Assembled in Council at Graysville, Tennessee \n\n\n     Dear Fellow Laborers: . . . How many have read carefully Patriarchs and Prophets, The Great Controversy, and The Desire of Ages? I wish all to understand that my confidence in the light that God has given stands firm, because I know that the Holy Spirit's power magnified the truth, and made it honorable, saying: \"This is the way, walk ye in it.\" In my books, the truth is stated, barricaded by a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" \n\n\n                                -45- \n\nThe Holy Spirit traced these truths upon my heart and mind as indelibly as the law was traced by the finger of God, upon the tables of stone, which are now in the ark, to be brought forth in that great day when sentence will be pronounced against every evil, seducing science produced by the father of lies.--Letter 90, 1906. (Colporteur Ministry, p. 126.) \n\n\n                                -47- \n\nExhibits Compiled by Ron Graybill and Robert W. Olson Ellen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May 23, 1979",
