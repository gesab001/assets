    "word": "Frivolous Conversation--Cultivate the precious gift of speech as an agency entrusted to you by God. Do not introduce frivolous, nonsensical subjects of conversation. Talk so that minds not of our faith will receive the impression that sound speech and sound principles have been brought into your education. \"Ye are the light of the world.\" Who are thus honored? All who have improved their opportunities to learn how to serve the Lord in the gift of speech.--Ms. 74, 1897.",
