    "word": "The young man came to Christ and asked, \"What good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\" The answer was, \"If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments\" [Matthew 19:16, 17]. The same answer was given to the lawyer, and the lawyer told Him that the law told him to \"love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.\" And Christ said unto him, \"Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live\" [Luke 10:27, 28]. So you have the whole duty laid down, and that is to keep the commandments if you expect to have eternal life. What was lost through Adam by disobedience must be brought back by obedience.",
