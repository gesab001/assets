    "word": "God deals with men as responsible beings. He will work by His Spirit through the mind He has put in man, if man will only give Him a chance to work, and will recognize His dealings. He designs that each shall use his mind and conscience for himself. He does not intend that one man shall become the shadow of another, uttering only another's sentiments.",
