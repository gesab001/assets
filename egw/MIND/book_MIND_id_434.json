    "word": "Many May Be Saved From Degradation \n\n     I have been shown that the medical missionary work will discover, in the very depths of degradation, men who once possessed fine minds, richest qualifications, who will be rescued by proper labor from their fallen condition. It is the truth as it is in Jesus that is to be brought before human minds after they have been sympathetically cared for and their physical necessities met. The Holy Spirit is working and co-operating with the human agencies that are laboring for such souls, and some will appreciate the foundation upon a rock for their religious faith.",
