    "word": "Christ said, 'If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.' I feel such an intense interest that every soul shall see, and understand and be charmed with the consistency of the truth. The evidence of our love to Christ is not pretension; but practice. My brother, \n                                                                           1166\nit is hard for the mind to comprehend this point, and do not confuse any mind with ideas that will not harmonize with the word. Please to consider that under the teaching of Christ many of the disciples were lamentably ignorant; but when the Holy Spirit that Jesus promised, came upon them and made the vacillating Peter the champion of faith. What a transformation in his character. But do not lay one pebble for a soul that is weak in the faith to stumble over, in over-wrought presentations or expressions. Be ever consistent, calm, deep, and solid. Do not go to any extreme in anything, but keep your feet on solid rock. O precious, precious Saviour. 'He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he is it that loveth me, and he that believeth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.'",
