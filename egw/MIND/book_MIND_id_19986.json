    "word": "We do not want to get in the way of those who are doing well there now. God will, I believe, direct us aright when we so much desire counsel from Him. We only want His will done in us. We only want to be where we can accomplish the greatest amount of good. There is much to be done here that others cannot do as well as we can. There are meetings every day, and sometimes twice a day, to get matters straightened out that are in a tangle. All the matters require thought and are a tax upon the mind, especially if that mind is worn. We shall especially need the help of God if we stand at this post.",
