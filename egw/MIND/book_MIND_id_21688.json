    "word": "Satan began his work by doing just as men who ought to know better are doing today. He complained of the supposed defects in the management of heavenly things, and sought to fill the minds of the angels unfallen with his disaffection. Because he was not supreme ruler, he sowed seeds of doubt and unbelief against Christ. Because he was not as God, he strove to instill into the minds of the angels his own envy and dissatisfaction.",
