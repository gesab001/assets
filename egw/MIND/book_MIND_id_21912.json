    "word": "Will you please send me the last two letters I have written you. I will not weary you with a long letter which you may wish I had never written, but I would say, before I close, in no case neglect your present opportunities and privileges. Choose for your associates those who hold religion and its practical influence in high respect. Keep the future life constantly in view. Let not your associations put these thoughts out of your mind. Nothing will more effectually banish serious impressions than intercourse with the vain, careless, and irreligious. Whatever intellectual greatness such persons may attain, if they treat religion with levity or even with indifference, they should not be your chosen friends. The more engaging their manners in other respects, the more should you dread their influence as companions, because they would throw around you an irreligious, godless, irreverent influence and yet combine it with so many attractions that it is positively dangerous to morals. If you rightly improve your privileges, you will have reason to rejoice, at the close of your probation, that your most intimate associates were persons whom God loved, persons of exemplary piety. Should you choose associates of an opposite character, there will come a period when on your side there will be unavailing regrets.",
