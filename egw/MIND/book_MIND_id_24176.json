    "word": "In the providence of God, there come to this people, in time of need, favorable opportunities to secure valuable facilities that can be utilized wisely for the rapid advancement of the cause. At times, the Lord has specified that we should come into possession of properties in certain localities where we needed to obtain an entrance for the proclamation of the third angel's message. The idea that we are not to purchase any such properties, unless first the money is in hand, is not in accordance with the mind of God. Again and again, in years past, the Lord has tested our faith by opening the way for us to secure places possessing advantages, at a cost far below their real value and at a time when we had no money. We have at such times, met the situation by borrowing money on interest, and advancing in harmony with the command of our divine leader who bade us advance in faith. These experiences have been attended with many perplexing problems, but the Lord has helped us through them all, and His name has been glorified. Had we hesitated, the precious cause would have been retarded rather than advanced, and, in many cases, opportunity would have been given our enemies (854) to triumph over our failures to secure these advantages placed within our reach. In such matters as these, we are to learn to walk by faith, when necessary, as some have walked in the past.",
