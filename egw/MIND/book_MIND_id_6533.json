    "word": "Christ demands all. If He required less, His sacrifice was too dear, too great to make to bring us up to such a level. . . . \"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\" This is a self-denying way. And when you think that the way is too strait, that there is too much self-denial in this narrow path; when you say, How hard to give up all, ask yourselves the question, What did Christ give up for me? This question puts anything that we may call self-denial in the shade.",
