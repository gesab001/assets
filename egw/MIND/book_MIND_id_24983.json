    "word": "Wherever you labor, come close to your brethren. Bear in mind that the Holy Spirit is the converter and sanctifier of the soul. The power of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is pledged to every believer, to preserve unity and love, and to sustain him in his labor for the recovery of lost souls. When we are with Christ, we will co-operate harmoniously for the salvation of souls. There is no miracle of mercy unperformed, no angel left undirected, that is necessary for the work of uniting God's people in the grand work of saving souls.",
