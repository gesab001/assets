    "word": "Make God your entire dependence. When you do otherwise, then it is time for a halt to be called. Stop right where you are and change the order of things. . . . In sincerity, in soul-hunger, cry after God. Wrestle with the heavenly agencies until you have the victory. Put your whole being into the Lord's hands--soul, body, and spirit--and resolve to be His loving, consecrated agency, moved by His will, controlled by His mind, infused by His Spirit; . . . then you will see heavenly things clearly.--MS 24, 1891. (SD 105.)",
