    "word": "Revelation is not the creation or invention of something new, but the manifestation of what was, until revealed, unknown to human beings. The great and eternal truths contained in the gospel are revealed through diligent searching and humbling of ourselves before God. The divine Teacher leads the mind of the humble seeker for truth; and by the Holy Spirit's guidance, the truths of the Word are made known to him. And there can be no more certain and efficient way of knowledge than in being thus guided. The promise of the Saviour was \"When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth\" (John 16:13). It is through the impartation of the Holy Spirit that we are made to understand the Word of God.",
