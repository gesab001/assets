    "word": "When young and old give careful, prayerful thought to the fitness required of all who do true service for God, a decided reformation will be seen. In the place of drinking in iniquity, the heart will be filled to overflowing with the love of Christ. The whole being will be enlisted in God's service. The affections will be set on things above. We shall respond heartily to the words of life, \"Thou \n\n\n                                     -125- \n\nshalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\"",
