    "word": "We have a feast of fat things and when we see souls grasping the light we are rejoiced, looking unto Jesus who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Christ is the great pattern; His character must be our character. All excellence is in Him. Turning from man and every other model with open face we behold Jesus in all His glory. And their minds are filled with the grand and overpowering ideas of His excellency; every other object sinks into insignificance, and every part of moral discipline is lost which does not promote their likeness to His image. I see heights and depths that we may reach accepting every ray of light and going forward to a greater light. The end is near and God forbid that we shall be asleep at this time.",
