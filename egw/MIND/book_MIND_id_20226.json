    "word": "So you see that it is impossible for us to have any agreement with the positions taken by Brother _____, for no lie is of the truth. His proofs do not belong where he places them, and although he may lead minds to believe his theory in regard to the sanctuary, this is no evidence that his theory is true. We have had a plain and decided testimony to bear for half a century. The positions taken in my books are truth. The truth was revealed to us by \n\n\n                                    -321- \n\nthe Holy Spirit, and we know that Brother _____'s position is not according to the word of God. His theory is a deceiving theory, and he misapplies Scriptures. Theories of the kind that he has been presenting, we have had to meet again and again.",
