    "word": "This last scripture carries our minds forward to the triumph of Israel and Judah. The accomplishment of the work will be through human instrumentalities charged with divine power. All the glory is ascribed to the great power of God, but it is through unity and cooperation of the human with the divine, that the result is made possible. Humanity, blended with divinity, grasps the divine efficiency, and the work is complete.",
