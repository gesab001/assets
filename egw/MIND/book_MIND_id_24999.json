    "word": "I am instructed to say to parents, Place yourselves soul and spirit, on the Lord's side of this question. We need ever to bear in mind that in these days of probation we are on trial before the Lord of the universe. Will you not give up indulgences that are doing you an injury? Words of profession are cheap; let your acts of self-denial testify that you will be obedient to the demands God makes of his peculiar people. Then put into the treasury a portion of the means you save by your acts of self-denial, and there will be that with which to carry on the work of God.",
