    "word": "We desire that there may be connected with this institution workers who shall give line upon line, precept upon precept, in order that those who come here may be benefited and blessed, and that they may see the consistency of breaking away from rebellion against the Divine laws, and may come into harmony with the Lord God of heaven, who has made such an infinite sacrifice in their behalf. Shall we not all give to Him our heart, our mind, our service, our thoughts, all there is of us? Shall we not serve Him faithfully, and at last find entrance into the beautiful city of our God?--Ms. 115, 1907.",
