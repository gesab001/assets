    "word": "It is a mistake to encourage the separate conferences to place everything before the finite minds of those at Battle Creek, asking them what they shall do. Men will never develop wisdom in management, either in business matters or in spiritual things, if they are educated to depend upon other men's brains to think and plan for them. If they make mistakes, these very mistakes may be permitted by the Lord, to be turned into victory if they will learn to improve in these things. Do men want always to remain shadows of other men's minds? God has made no exception in his promise. \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.\" \n\n\n                     - 36 -",
