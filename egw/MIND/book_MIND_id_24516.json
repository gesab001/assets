    "word": "Intemperance and ungodliness are increasing everywhere. The work of temperance must begin in our own hearts. And the work of the physicians must begin in an understanding of the works and teachings of the great Physician. Christ left the courts of heaven that He might minister to the sick and suffering of earth. We must cooperate with the chief of physicians, walking in all humility of mind before Him. Then the Lord will bless our earnest efforts to relieve suffering humanity. It is not by the use of poisonous drugs that this will be done, but by the use of simple remedies. We should seek to correct false habits and practices, and teach the lessons of self denial. The indulgence of appetite is the greatest evil with which we have to contend.",
