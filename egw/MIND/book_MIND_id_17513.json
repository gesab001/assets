    "word": "Children who receive this kind of instruction will not be a burden, a cause of solicitude in our institutions; but they will be a strength, a support to physicians and nurses. They will be prepared to fill places of responsibility, and by precept and example will be constantly aiding others to do right. Those whose moral sensibilities have not been blunted will appreciate right principles; they will put a just estimate upon their natural endowments, and will make the best use of their physical, mental, and moral powers. Such souls are strongly fortified against temptation; they are surrounded by a wall not easily broken down. All such characters are, with the blessing of God, light-bearers. Their influence tends to educate others for a practical Christian life. The mind may be so elevated that divine thoughts and contemplations come to be as natural as breath. All the faculties of the soul are to be trained. We must do God's work intelligently. We must know the truth; and to know the truth is to know God.",
