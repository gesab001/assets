    "word": "We know not how soon we shall be singled out as not being law-abiding citizens, because the prince of the power of the air is getting possession of the minds of men.

If we obey God, His Holy Spirit is resting upon us, and we are not fighting with our own assertions, but with \"It is written.\" All we have to do is to go back to the fourth commandment.
