    "word": "True faith lays hold of and claims the promised blessing before it is realized and felt. We must send up our petitions in faith within the second veil and let our faith take hold of the promised blessing and claim it as ours. We are then to believe that we receive the blessing, because our faith has hold of it, and according to the Word it is ours. \"What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\" Mark 11:24. Here is faith, naked faith, to believe that we receive the blessing, even before we realize it. When the promised blessing is realized and enjoyed, faith is swallowed up. But many suppose they have much faith when sharing largely of the Holy Spirit and that they cannot have faith unless they feel the power of the Spirit. Such confound faith with the blessing that comes through faith. The very time to exercise faith is when we feel destitute of the Spirit. When thick clouds of darkness seem to hover over the mind, then is the time to let living faith pierce the darkness and scatter the clouds. True faith rests on the promises contained in the Word of God, and those only who obey that Word can claim its glorious \n                                                                           73\npromises. \"If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\" John 15:7. \"Whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.\" 1 John 3:22.",
