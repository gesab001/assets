    "word": "It should be the object of our colleges to prepare workers for home and foreign fields. The duty devolves on the church to see that a fund is raised to be appropriated to the education of students who are worthy but have not at their command the means of obtaining an education. When these students shall be in a position where they can replace what they receive, they should do so, that the fund may be kept good. Our colleges are not able to give the students their tuition, for they do not, like other denominational schools, receive donations and endowments. Hence there is greater necessity for raising special funds to be wisely appropriated by the judgment of a board of directors. There are many unordained men and also women who can do much in the several branches of the work in the great harvest field. May the Lord open the minds and the hearts of His people to discern what needs to be done, and to do it. Let us work while the day lasts, for the night cometh, in which no man can work.--Letter 25a, 1990. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nJune 13, 1991. Entire Letter.",
