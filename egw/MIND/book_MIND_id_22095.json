    "word": "The Christian physician is not to exercise his skill solely in studying the disease and its treatment, but he is in the highest sense a missionary. In the sight of all heaven he is to work for Christ, who has bought him with an infinite price. Let no base, groveling thoughts be entertained, but let your conversation be holy; be ready to speak a word in season. Speak of the value of the soul and of its perils out of Christ. Sow the seeds of truth, and the Lord Jesus will keep your mind and heart; His righteousness will go before you; heavenly angels will minister unto you. The glory of the Lord will be your rereward. [See Isaiah 58:8].",
