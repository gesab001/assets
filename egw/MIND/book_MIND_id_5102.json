    "word": "A Warning Against False Teaching \n\n     At this time we need in the cause of God spiritual-minded men, men who are firm in principle, and who have a clear understanding of the truth. I have been instructed that it is not new and fanciful doctrines nor human suppositions which the people need, but the testimony of men who know and practice the truth, men who understand and obey the charge given to Timothy: \"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\" [2 Timothy 4:2.]",
