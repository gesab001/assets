    "word": "The church, as a body, is to do all in its power to promote union and prevent schisms. This rule is designed to guide every individual member in his treatment of others. If unsound doctrine is introduced, it will endanger the flock of Christ. It is the duty of those in authority, who are jealous for the truth as it is in Jesus, to make a firm, decided protest. This expression of rebuke will often be used to create sympathy for the reproved. The harm that is \n\n\n                                 -160- \n\nthus done to precious souls and to Christ's kingdom is not considered. At this crisis is the time to decide who are God's faithful sentinels, who will be true to principle; who will bear in mind that truth is too dearly purchased for its least principle to be surrendered.",
