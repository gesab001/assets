    "word": "Not Self-Sufficient and Dictatorial \n     The presidents of our conferences must be men who are not self-sufficient and dictatorial. They must not give place to the idea that the office of president comprehends a vast amount of rulership. With such ideas they will leave impressions upon minds that will do injury to the work. Precious privileges will be lost to the people when presidents minutely define and direct the work of their co-laborers.--Letter 270, 1902, p. 2. \n\n\n                                     -177-",
