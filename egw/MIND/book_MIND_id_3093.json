    "word": "We have no time now to enter into unnecessary controversy, but we should earnestly consider the need of seeking the Lord for true conversion of heart and life. There should be determined efforts made to secure sanctification of soul and mind. There is a deep and earnest work to be done in every church and in every family. Fathers and mothers have a solemn work to do in bringing their children to understand the necessity of seeking the Lord for salvation from sin.--Letter 226, 1908.",
