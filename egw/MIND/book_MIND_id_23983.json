Glendale, Los Angeles, Calif. \n\nDr. _____ Holden, Portland, Oregon. \n\nDear Brother and Sister Holden:- \n     I have been disappointed and sorry that you did not feel that you could unite with us in our sanitarium work. If you knew how much we need you, I think you would change your mind. I know you have the ability to act a part in the work in more than one line of work. You can do good work as a teacher and as a surgeon. I ask you to come and help us here in Southern California. Sister Sarah Peck, who has been connected with my work for several years, has been telling me a little of your experience. We are sorry that you have been so disappointed. If you will come to Southern California I can assure you that you will receive a hearty welcome. We are in great need of a thoroughly trained man to act as surgeon and teacher. Come, and we will treat you as the son of the Prince of Life, your wife as the daughter of the King, and your little one as the Lord's child.",
