    "word": "Intermediate schools are highly essential. There are many parents who do not know how to train their children to be workers together with God. They have not in all things outgrown their childishness, and therefore they know not now to care properly for the church in their homes. Fathers and mothers have become indifferent to their obligations to God and unmindful of their duty to their children. Therefore we must establish schools that will be as the schools of the prophets.",
