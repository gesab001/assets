    "word": "That evening Christ showed His disciples His hands and His feet so that no doubt that He was the Christ might exist in their minds. \u201cBehold my hands and my feet,\u201d He said, \u201cthat it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. . . . These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day.\u201dManuscript 113, 1897.",
