    "word": "It is not best to preach on the subject of Pantheism or to read quotations from authors who write on this subject, and the specious, deceptive errors that lead to it.

These statements will do more to enlighten minds than all the explanations or theories that our ministers and teachers may put forth concerning these matters.",
