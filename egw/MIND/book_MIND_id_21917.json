    "word": "Since coming to this field of labor, your mother has had severe and fiery trials; but in talking of these trials and in writing concerning them, I find that they bite more keenly into my soul. I may not last long, but ere my life closes I would see you, my son, filling the place that the Lord would have you. You have a work to do, and you must not fail nor be discouraged. Again and again Satan has tried you on this same test, and as a result you have yielded to temptation. Now I write to you, knowing that the Lord has a work for you to do. If you walk humbly with God, He will help and strengthen you, and give you His peace. The Sun of Righteousness will shine into your heart and mind, and you will be all light in the Lord. Place your hand in the hand of Jesus, and say, \"I believe in Thee. I trust in Thee. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord and only in the Lord.\"",
