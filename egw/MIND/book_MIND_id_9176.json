    "word": "Sick\n \n\n     Ministering to the afflicted is part of the minister's work.--To take people right where they are, whatever their position or condition, and help them in every way possible--this is gospel ministry. Those who are diseased in body are nearly always diseased in mind, and when the soul is sick, the body also is affected. Ministers should feel it a part of their work to minister to the sick and the afflicted whenever opportunity presents itself. The minister of the gospel is to present the message, which must be received if the people are to become sanctified and made ready for the coming of the Lord. This work is to embrace all that was embraced in Christ's ministry.--6T 301.",
