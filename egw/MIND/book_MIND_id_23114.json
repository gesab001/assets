    "word": "There was poor Brother Ostrander that went to that meeting, unbalanced in mind, little less than insane man. His brethren were in so great blindness they were so wrought up over the law in Galatians, they had no sense to discern his true condition and the question was gravely asked me by the committee who visited me, for my counsel of Bro. Ostrander. Would not he be one whose name should be put on the paper as one to run for the presidency of General Conference? This man was even dangerous in his home in his insanity before he left home, for his wife has told me in regard to it. But this man was fully in the confidence of Elder Butler and in his weak condition strong impressions from this man were made on his mind. As Brother Butler stated, my best and most experienced ministering brethren could tell him their hearts were nearly broken at the positions Sister White took at the General Conference. I wish for these ministers' sake, the breaking of the heart would have been more thorough for then there would be reformation and the mould of God would be upon them in the place of the mould of men. Would that these brethren would be illuminated by the spirit of God rather than to \n                                                                           301\ncontinue longer walking in the sparks of their own kindling. They talk thru mist, thru doubts, thru darkness but do not open their hearts to the light that God has sent them to clear away the fog. They close their hearts to knowledge that God would give them but open them to all the doubts that are floating from one to another.",
