    "word": "Great Wisdom Needed.--Great wisdom is needed in dealing with diseases caused through the mind. A sore, sick heart, a discouraged mind, needs mild treatment. . . . It is through tender sympathy that this class of invalids can be benefited. The physician should first gain their confidence and then point them to the Great Healer. If their faith can be directed to the True Physician and they can have confidence that He has undertaken their case, this will bring relief to the mind and often give health to the body.--MH 244 (1905).",
