The lack of stability in regard to the principles of health reform is a true index of their character and their spiritual strength.  {TSDF 36.11}  \n                                                     2 T.--202-203 \n     If the Saviour of men, with His divine strength, \n\n\n                                                                  37 \n\nfelt the need of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the necessity of prayer--fervent, constant prayer! When Christ was the most fiercely beset by temptation, He ate nothing. He committed Himself to God, and through earnest prayer, and perfect submission to the will of His Father, came off conqueror. Those who profess the truth for these last days, above every other class of professed Christians, should imitate the great Exemplar in prayer.  {TSDF 36.12}  \n     \"It is enough for the disciple that he be as His Master, and the servant as his lord.\" Our tables are frequently spread with luxuries neither healthful nor necessary, because we love these things more than we love self-denial, freedom from disease, and soundness of mind. Jesus sought earnestly for strength from His Father. This the divine Son of God considered of more value, even for Himself, than to sit at the most luxurious table. He has given us evidence that prayer is essential in order to receive strength to contend with the powers of darkness, and to do the work allotted us. Our own strength is weakness, but that which God gives is mighty, and will make every one who obtains it more than conqueror.",
