    "word": "It is a great fallacy in a man [to claim] that because he has accepted certain theories, his ideas are infallible. If others cannot see these things in the same way another sees them, what then? Because he has expressed his faith in that sentiment, \n\n\n                                     -226- \n\nhas he immortalized that idea in his mind as unchangeable? There are some who express ideas as the truth, but is that man's mind immortalized? Is his view of matters unchangeable? We need good, sound, common sense. If we have certain ideas of things and another views these things in a different light, and expresses them thus, what shall be done? Withdraw fellowship from him? No, but these objectionable things, if expressed, cause dissension and strife.",
