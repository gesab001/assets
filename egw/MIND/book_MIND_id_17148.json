    "word": "God the Master Worker. \n\n     Times are growing hard, and money is difficult to obtain; but God will open the way for us from sources outside our own people. I cannot see how any one can take exceptions to the receiving of gifts from those not of our faith. They can only do so by taking extreme views, and by creating issues which they are not authorized to do. This is God's world, and if God could move upon human agents so that the land which has been in the hands of the enemy, may be brought into our hands, \n\n\n                         - 44 - \n\nso that the message may be proclaimed in regions beyond, shall men block up the way with their narrow notions? Such conscientiousness as this is anything but healthful. The Holy Spirit does not lead men to pursue such a course. Let all be careful how they interpose themselves between God, the great Master-worker, and his people. We should see and acknowledge the workings of his providence, and bow to his authority. Let every messenger of God attend to his own specific work, and not rush into a work that is simply after his own wisdom and devising. Let the Lord's messengers go unto the mercy-seat, that they may receive wisdom and grace to know God, to understand his workings. Knowledge of God will give them well-balanced minds and sound judgment, that they will not move impulsively at this critical, important time of earth's history.",
