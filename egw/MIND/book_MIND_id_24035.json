    "word": "The appointed leaders of our churches need themselves to seek the Lord with humble, broken hearts; then they will discern their own defects of character. They need to present their cases before the Lord, asking, what shall I do that I may comprehend my individual duty? What shall I do that I may meet the mind and will of God? And when you have asked this question, my brethren, do not yield the point until you have surrendered soul, body, and spirit to God. Then God can stamp His image on your soul.",
