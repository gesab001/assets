    "word": "Many times has God shown the responsibility and burden he has laid upon James. Gladly would he be free from it, and he would have thrown it off if he dared to, but feared the displeasure of God. God has placed him in the Office, but in what light have you regarded him? As an intruder, a meddler into that which in no way concerned him, taking upon him things which did not belong to him. How much union have you had with the Spirit of God, or his work, or his teachings? The visions do not bear with any weight upon your mind.",
