    "word": "My message to Brother Harris is, Stop right where you are. Do not proceed further. God does not want His people to depend upon haphazard speculations for the advancement of His cause. When our people come to depend on such things, their minds will be drawn away from the truths that they should heed, and they will neglect the most solemn truths of His word. But let the Spirit of God rest upon the hearts of God's children, and they will sacrifice for His work, and He will open the way for it to go forward in verity and godly dignity.",
