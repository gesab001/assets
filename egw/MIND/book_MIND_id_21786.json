    "word": "Whatever may come to tempt you, bear in mind the fact that with every temptation, Christ has made a way of escape. You should not give up to discouragement. Bear in mind the fact that Jesus is at your right hand, and that He helps you. You may trust in Him implicitly, irrespective of what others may think of you or how others may treat you. You will become an overcomer through the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony.",
