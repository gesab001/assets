    "word": "Brethren, why are we not more diligent, not only in hearing but in doing the words of Christ? \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.\" Matthew 4:4. It is because there is such inattention in hearing the lessons Christ has given to us, and such negligence in doing His words, that there is so great want of spiritual health and vital spiritual life in our midst. The Spirit of the Lord is grieved with our disregard of the words of the heavenly Teacher, and we do not have peace, joy, and heavenly discernment. If there were less combating and more praying for the mind that was in Christ Jesus and for divine grace to win souls, there would be altogether a different atmosphere in these meetings. \n                                                                           181",
