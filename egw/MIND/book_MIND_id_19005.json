    "word": "Christ Jesus is the great Power for correcting all the threads of influence that Satan would appropriate to compose his web. But the enemy's work is so subtle that those who ought to be wise seem to be blind. They discern nothing of the effect of their words dropped to divert minds to \n\n\n                        -4- \n\nfalse theories. The time given to this devising and planning might better be devoted to work in which God has called men to act their part. Let them give counsel when they are sure that they have words from the Lord. Quite enough haphazard work has been done by catching at ideas which, if carried out, prove to be mistakes.",
