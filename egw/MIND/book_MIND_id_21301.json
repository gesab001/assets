    "word": "Christ, the Author of truth, did not disdain to present truths that were old and familiar. The great purpose of His mission was ever kept in view. When this purpose could be served by the repetition of familiar truths, He employed them. By unsanctified minds, many of these truths had been disconnected from their true position and had been employed to strengthen error. Christ recovered and replaced them as links in the great chain of redemption.",
