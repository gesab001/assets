It is not wise to send the children to schools where they are subject to long hours of confinement, and where they will gain no knowledge of what healthful living means. Place them under the tuition of those who respect the body and treat it with consideration. Do not place your children in an unfavorable position, where they cannot receive the training that will enable them to bear test and trial. . . . \n\n\n                     -27-",
