    "word": "We have only to come, complying with the invitation, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink\" (John 7:37). \"Him that cometh to me I will no wise cast out\" (chap. 6:37). Every human being, as he reads these words, should feel that he is on holy ground. Remember that the life of the only begotten Son of God was offered up for you. As the Holy Spirit impresses Christ's words on the heart and mind, man must feel that he is in the presence of superior goodness, superseding immeasurably anything that earth can afford. He must feel that he is occupying holy ground, for he is close to the living fountain of mercy and love.",
