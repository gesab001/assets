    "word": "GW92 - Gospel Workers (1892)\n\n\nPREFACE\n     \n     AS SETTING FORTH THE SCOPE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK, IT WOULD PERHAPS BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE READER TO THE TABLE OF CONTENTS THAN TO THE FEW WORDS THAT MAY BE WRITTEN BY WAY OF PREFACE. IF THE READER WILL GLANCE OVER THAT PORTION OF THE BOOK, HE WILL SEE AT ONCE THE IMPORTANT FIELD OF THOUGHT TO WHICH THE MIND IS LED, AND THE WIDE RANGE OF PRACTICAL TRUTHS ON WHICH INSTRUCTION IS GIVEN.  {GW92 v.1} \n     1. THE MINISTER AND THE MISSIONARY ARE PARTICULARLY MENTIONED, BUT WHAT IS WRITTEN IS ALSO FOR THE \u201cGOSPEL WORKER\u201d IN GENERAL. AND HOW MANY DOES THIS EMBRACE? ALL WHO HAVE PARTAKEN OF THE BLESSINGS OF THE GOSPEL SHOULD SEEK TO MAKE KNOWN ITS BENEFITS TO OTHERS. THE INSTRUCTION OF THIS WORK IS THEREFORE FOR ALL.  {GW92 v.2} \n     2. IT IS NOT SENT OUT THAT ITS INSTRUCTIONS MAY BE PUT INTO PRACTICE BY WAY OF EXPERIMENT; FOR THESE PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN TRIED AND TESTED, MANY HAVE STUDIED THE TRUTHS HEREIN SET FORTH, HAVE LISTENED TO THESE WORDS OF INSTRUCTION, AND HAVE TRIED TO FOLLOW THE COUNSEL GIVEN. AND THE RESULTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MOST HAPPY, AND THE FRUITS GOOD. SUCH PERSONS HAVE CALLED FOR THE MATTER OF THIS BOOK TO BE SET FORTH IN THIS FORM, FOR THEIR OWN FURTHER STUDY AND FOR THE \nvi\nGOOD OF OTHERS. A COMPLIANCE WITH THIS DESIRE IS ONE REASON WHY THIS WORK NOW APPEARS.  {GW92 v.3} \n     IN ORDER TO BRING THE BOOK WITHIN DESIRED LIMITS, IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO OMIT PARTS OF ARTICLES TAKEN FROM THE \u201cTESTIMONIES.\u201d ALL SUCH OMISSIONS ARE MARKED BY PERIODS (. . . ). QUOTATIONS TAKEN FROM THE \u201cTESTIMONIES\u201d ARE CREDITED TO VOLUME AND PAGE; AND FOR CONVENIENCE, ALL OTHER SELECTIONS, WHETHER FROM UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPT OR OTHER SOURCES, EXCEPT IN THE CHAPTERS OF FRAGMENTS, ARE CREDITED MS.  {GW92 vi.1} \n     3. THE PUBLISHERS THEREFORE SEND IT FORTH, COMMENDING IT TO THE ATTENTION AND EARNEST, DILIGENT STUDY OF ALL, WITH THE FULL ASSURANCE THAT AS ITS INSTRUCTION SHALL BE PUT INTO PRACTICE, IT WILL PROVE A SOURCE OF PERENNIAL BENEFIT AND BLESSING TO THE CAUSE OF THE MASTER, IN THE EARTH.\n                     PUBLISHERS.  {GW92 vi.2} \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Minister\n\nAmbassadors for Christ

is the minister in the sanctuary above, he is also, through his delegates, the minister of his church on earth. He speaks to the people through chosen men, and carries forward his work through them, as when, in the days of his humiliation, he moved visibly upon the earth. Although centuries have passed, the lapse of time has not changed his parting promise to his disciples. \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d [Matthew 28:20.] From Christ's ascension to the present day, men ordained of God, deriving their authority from him, have become teachers of the faith. Christ, the True Shepherd, superintends his work through the instrumentality of these under-shepherds. Thus the position of those who labor in word and doctrine becomes very important. In Christ's stead they beseech the people to be reconciled to God.",
