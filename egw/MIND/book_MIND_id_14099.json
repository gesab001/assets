    "word": "A new year has commenced. What has been the record of the past year in your Christian life? How stands your record in heaven? I entreat you to make an unreserved surrender to God. Have your hearts been divided? Give them wholly to the Lord now. Make a different life history the coming year from that of the past. Humble your souls before God. \"Blessed \n                                                                           522\nis the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love Him.\" Put away all pretense and affectation. Act your simple, natural self. Be truthful in every thought and word and deed, and \"in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.\" Ever remember that the moral nature needs to be braced with constant watchfulness and prayer. As long as you look to Christ, you are safe; but the moment you think of your sacrifices and difficulties, and begin to sympathize with and pet yourself, you lose your trust in God and are in great peril.",
