    "word": "The education gained in our schools by the study of objectionable authors has not been of that order that will mark the character of our schools with religious piety and consistency. When students enter school, their minds should be drawn to the Word of God; they should be taught to feed upon the teaching of Christ. As year after year passes into eternity and we draw near the end of this world's history, increased responsibility rests upon every teacher in our schools. The results of a rich and varied experience are shining upon our pathway, and teachers need to work in harmony with the increase of light, in order that their spiritual development may be proportionate to the light given. The treasures of the Bible, which, during the last few years have been rescued from the rubbish and re-set in a framework of truth, place God's commandment-keeping people upon vantage ground. If this divine light is received into the mind, it will sanctify the soul and equip it to stand, by the grace of God, through the coming conflict. . . .",
