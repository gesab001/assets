    "word": "Do not be surprised if great changes are made.  Do not wonder if the men who felt themselves capable of handling the consciences of their fellowman, and of controlling the minds and talents God has given them should go back, and walk no more with these who believe the truth.  The truth makes too great a demand upon them.  When they see that they must die to self, and practice the principles of self-denial, they are displeased because they cannot gratify their ambitious desire to rule other men.  Their true characters will appear.  Some will make total shipwreck of the faith.  \"They went out from us, but they were not of us,\" said John, and so it will be again.",
