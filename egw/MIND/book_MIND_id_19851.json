    "word": "The workers brought together in the providence of God may have traits of character that differ widely. Yet their gifts may be just what God needs to mold and fashion the minds with which they are brought in contact. They are to labor in harmony, however different they may be. The Lord looks from heaven, and sees that in His work on this earth, a variety of gifts is needed. The church is a garden, adorned with different trees and plants and flowers.",
