    "word": "Hard references, personal applications, charging upon an opponent, are not the work given to any mortal who is in Christ's service. We must be true as steel to principle, true to our loyalty to God, all the while considering that he who opposes the truth is opposing the counsel of God against himself. Let your heart melt with pity for the one whose heart is enclosed with the meshes of Satan. While supposing that he is doing God service, he is fighting against the truth. He cannot discern this to be truth, because he will not come to the truth to search for the truth with unprejudiced mind. The love of Christ should be in our hearts.",
