    "word": "I saw how busy Satan had been. He saw that the nominal [First-day Adventists] could not overthrow us, so he began to put prejudices in the minds of our dearest brethren, so as to hinder the work and overthrow James, and also to cause the faith in the visions to be destroyed, but he failed in his endeavors. And then he attacked his body, but by faith James was wrenched from his grasp and placed in the hands of the Great Physician who applied the balm and set him free. I saw that Satan's darts were hurled at us more than at others so as to destroy the confidence of God's children in the visions, and to get James down so as to stop his work on the paper. I saw that each one of us must labor for the salvation of souls, that we all can do something.",
