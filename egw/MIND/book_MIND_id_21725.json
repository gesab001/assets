    "word": "All our medical workers must not receive the stamp of one man's mind. In different places there should be sanitariums of a high order, where our young people can receive a thorough training. We are not to countenance the carrying on of sanitariums of an inferior order in which incompetent instructors will do slipshod work, and call it educational work. The instructors in our medical missionary training schools must be picked men and women of ability.",
