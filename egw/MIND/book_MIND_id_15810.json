    "word": "The mine of truth is to be explored interestedly, diligently. How often we find Christ applying the Old Testament Scriptures, expounding their truths, showing their spiritual character, clothing them with freshness and richness and beauty the people had never beheld before. . . .

Thus the intellect aspiring to reach the standard of perfection becomes elevated to comprehend it. . . .",
