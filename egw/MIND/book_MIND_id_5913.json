    "word": "As the believer bows in supplication before God, and in humility and contrition offers his petition from unfeigned lips, he loses all thought of self. His mind is filled with the thought of what he must have in order to build up a Christlike character. He prays, \"Lord, if I am to be a channel through which Thy love is to flow day by day and hour by hour, I claim by faith the grace and power that Thou hast promised.\" He fastens his hold firmly on the promise, \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, . . . and it shall be given him.\"",
