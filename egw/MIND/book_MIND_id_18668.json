    "word": "Your mind is not well-balanced. You are moved by impulse. You make statements in the pulpit, and then go away and contradict them in your conversation. You preach, but do not practice; you have good qualities, but you abuse them, because you do not train your powers to serve God only. You serve yourself, and attract the people to yourself. Your brethren and sisters are certainly deceived in you.",
