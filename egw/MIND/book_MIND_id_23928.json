    "word": "\"In my last interview with Elder Irwin I said, if Dr. Kress could be spared from Wahroonga without crippling the work in Australia it would be well to call him to Washington. The work there is very important. It has been delayed too long. Strong physicians will there do much to strengthen our work throughout the field. Therefore, if good, faithful workers can be secured to take their place in Wahroonga, and if their minds are drawn toward Washington to work, secure their transfer if possible. I believe that the Lord has been working to bring about changes that would open the way for Dr. Kress to come to Washington. We need him there very much, and we need him just now at the opening of the work. \n                                                                           167\nI have written to you as early as possible, and have written hurriedly. I wish that Dr. Kress could get there before the opening of the Sanitarium.\"",
