    "word": "The harmonious relation of truth, like links in a chain, will, just as fast as the mind is quickened by the Spirit of God to comprehend light and in humbleness of mind appropriate it, be dispensed to others, and give the glory back to God. The development of truth will be the reward to the humble-hearted seeker, who will fear God and walk with Him. The truth which the mind grasps as truth is capable of constant expansion and new developments. While beholding it, the truth is seen in all its bearings in the life and character, and becomes more clear and certain and beauteous. As the mind grasps it in its preciousness, it becomes elevated, ennobled, sanctified. \n\n\n                                  -124-",
