    "word": "Union With Brethren Who Try Us \n     All who believe the great truths for this time, if sanctified through the truth, will wear the yoke of Christ. They will lift the burdens of responsibility. A spirit to act independently and alone must not be cherished. If they do this, in the place of the Lord's people being in perfect harmony, of one mind, one purpose, and consecrated to one great object, they will waste their capabilities, and their efforts will be fruitless.",
