But in a short time doubts were suggested by Satan, and he encouraged them, and gradually his faith again became unsettled, and unbelief gained the pre-eminence in his heart. If he had improved the grace given, and been as free to talk of the convictions of the Spirit of God, as to dwell upon unbelief, his darkness would have been dispelled, and his soul would have been light in the Lord. Darkness and confusion prevail over his mind because doubt and unbelief are cherished. Dr. Russell should take heed how he hears, otherwise he will be deceived, and will take the wisdom of the world and the opinions of men for the truth that comes from God, and thereby put darkness for light and light for darkness. I wish I could present the dangers of Dr. Russell before him as they really are. His salvation depends upon his cultivating decision of character. The sophistry of Satan has poisoned his mind, and is mingled with his thoughts and conversation.",
