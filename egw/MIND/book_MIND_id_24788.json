But little pleasantness and cheerfulness have been shown toward them, \n\n\n                                    -109- \n\nand but few words of approval have been spoken to them. The defective characters of the parents have been inherited, and the discipline given by these defective characters have been objectionable in the formation of characters. Solid timbers have not been brought into the character-building. There is no more important work that can be done than the educating and training of these youth and children. The teachers who work in this part of the Lord's vineyard need to learn first how to be self-possessed, keeping their own temper and feelings under control, in subjection to the Holy Spirit of God. They should give evidence of having not a one-sided experience, but a well balanced mind, a symmetrical character, so that they can be trusted because they are conscientious Christians themselves, under the chief Teacher, who has said, \"Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Then learning in Christ's school daily, they can educate children and youth.",
