    "word": "The question now before us is, Shall we try to secure the places that seem desirable in price and location, when we cannot tell where our money is coming from? . . . I am not prepared to say that we should not, under any circumstances, purchase land to which the Lord seems to have directed our minds, when there is no hindrance but the question of ready money, and which property, in the providence of God, we could soon pay for. We have to guard against mistakes on both sides. If we see a good opportunity to secure a building as in Paradise Valley, I think it should be purchased.--Letter 167, 1902, pp. 1, 2. (To Brother and Sister Evans, Oct. 26, 1902.)",
