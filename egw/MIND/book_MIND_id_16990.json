    "word": "Those who honor their parents would reap a reward in the fulfillment of the promise that they should live long upon the land which the Lord their God giveth them. Children are to continue in well-doing, praying that through the merits of Jesus, the Lord will give them His grace, His mind, and His beauty of character. God has withheld no blessing that is necessary for shaping the character of children and youth after the divine pattern given them in the youth of Jesus. They are to ask for the graces of His character, in simple, trusting faith, and in the name of Jesus, just as a son asks a favor of his earthly parent.",
