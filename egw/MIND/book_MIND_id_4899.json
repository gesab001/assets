    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     I cannot see that much is accomplished by open-air meetings. These may be held at times, and on special occasions will be the best means of reaching the people; but to make this a regular manner of labor will not at present secure the desired results. The laborer cannot make full proof of his ministry. A chance speech or discourse may set minds on a train of thought which will, through other influences that may be brought to bear upon them, result in their conversion; but these cases are rare. There is so great dearth of both men and means at this \n340\ntime that our brethren are not justified in doing this kind of work.",
