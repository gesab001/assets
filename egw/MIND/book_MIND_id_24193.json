    "word": "My brethren and sisters, harmonize, harmonize. Bring your minds into the right relation to God, and as your minds are sanctified, they will be refined. It cannot be otherwise , because the refining influence of the Spirit of God is upon you. It is for us to understand and appreciate that God has done great things for us. He has manifested such an intense interest in us, and worked so wonderfully in our behalf, that it is impossible for us to fully comprehend His goodness and His grace. He \"so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
