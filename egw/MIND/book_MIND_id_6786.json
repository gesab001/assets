    "word": "The Need of Integrity\n     If the canvasser pursues a wrong course, if he utters falsehood or practises deception, he loses his own self-respect. \n59\nHe may not be conscious that God sees him, and is acquainted with every business transaction, that holy angels are weighing his motives and listening to his words, and that his reward will be according to his works; but even if it were possible to conceal his wrong-doing from both human and divine inspection, his own knowledge of the sin is degrading to mind and character. One act does not determine the character, but it breaks down the barrier, and the next temptation is more readily entertained, until finally a habit of prevarication and dishonesty in business is formed, and the man can not be trusted.",
