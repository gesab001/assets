    "word": "I was shown that Bro. and Sr. Burnham are in danger of having their thoughts centered too much upon themselves, especially is Sr. Burnham at fault here. She has almost supreme love for herself. Sr. Burnham, you are poorly prepared to stand amid the perils \n                                                                           22\nof the day of God. You do not imitate the true pattern, Jesus. There was not one selfish act in his whole life. You have a work to do for yourself which no one can do for you. Divest yourself of selfishness, and learn the mind and will of God. Study to show yourself approved unto God. You are impulsive. You are naturally irritable and peevish. You work far beyond your strength. There is no virtue in this. God does not require it. A selfish disposition is at the bottom of this. Your motives are not praise-worthy. You shun responsibility and care-taking, and have felt that you should be considered, you should be favored. It is to be regretted that you have been favored from your childhood. You have been petted, and your will left unsubdued. Now you have the work to do at a more advanced age which should have been done in your childhood. Your husband has yielded to your wishes, and indulged your whims, to your injury.",
