    "word": "Ministers tell their congregations that there is danger of their going to hear the Adventists. They tell them that the Adventists have not any special interest in Wellington, that they have no one who will believe in their doctrines. If they should make some church members believe in their doctrines, where will they go to worship? They have no place of worship. They are only adventurers. They will come to the place and preach their pernicious doctrines, and mislead the minds of the people, and then go away and leave them. Then \"where would you be should you be deceived by these strange doctrines?\"",
