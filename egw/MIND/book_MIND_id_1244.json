    "word": "Elder Stockman spoke of my early misfortune, and said it was indeed a grievous affliction, but he bade me believe that the hand of a loving Father had not\n29\nbeen withdrawn from me; that in the future life, when the mist that then darkened my mind had vanished, I would discern the wisdom of the providence which had seemed so cruel and mysterious. Jesus said to His disciples, \"What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.\" John 13:7. In the great future we should no longer see as through a glass darkly, but come face to face with the mysteries of divine love.",
