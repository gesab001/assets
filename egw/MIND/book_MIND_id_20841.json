    "word": "So it is now. Christ sees His children before they see Him. He calls them before they answer Him. He has them in His mind before they notice Jesus. How cheerful it is to realize that we have a sympathizing Redeemer, who identifies His interests with those of suffering humanity. You may consider Him as your physician. He will, and does, give you grace. He will never leave nor forsake you. He will carry you from grace to grace. You need not be anxious. Simply rely upon Jesus Christ, your righteousness and your sufficiency.",
