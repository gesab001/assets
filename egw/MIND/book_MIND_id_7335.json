    "word": "The Way of Wisdom \n\n     The youth often urge that they need something to enliven and divert the mind. The Christian's hope is just what is needed. Religion will prove to the believer a comforter, a sure guide to the Fountain of true happiness. The young should study the word of God, giving themselves to meditation and prayer. They will find that their spare moments cannot be better employed. Wisdom's \"ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\"",
