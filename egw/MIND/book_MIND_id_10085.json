    "word": "When I pray earnestly for restoration, and it seems that the Lord does not answer, my spirit almost faints within me.  Then it is that the dear Saviour makes me mindful of His presence.  He says to me, Cannot you trust Him who has purchased you with His own blood? I have graven thee on the palms of My hands.  Then my soul is nourished with the divine Presence.  I am lifted out of myself, as it were, into the presence of God.  -- Ms 19, 1892.",
