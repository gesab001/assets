    "word": "Carefully select your subject, make your discourses short and important points of doctrine very plain. Take up one point at a time in a discourse. Make it strong and clear and plain, with reasons drawn from the Word of God that all may understand. Your discourses should be short. When you preach at great length the mind of the hearer cannot grasp one quarter of what you say. Letter 47, 1886, pp. 2, 3. (To Brother Bourdeau, June 5, 1886.)",
