    "word": "Chap. 5 - The Future of the Boulder Sanitarium\n[REMARKS MADE BY MRS. E. G. WHITE AT THE GENERAL CONFERENCE, MAY 29, 1905.] \n    \n     We all have great reason to praise the Lord. He has wrought wondrously for us in the transferring of the publishing work from Battle Creek to Washington, and in the establishment of a school here, that His purposes should be fulfilled. When we were first brought face to face with this matter, it looked like an impossibility, but at every step of our advance it has seemed that angels of God were at our side, leading, protecting, and helping. And those gathered at this meeting can see that the Lord has wrought upon minds, so that the funds necessary for the prosecution of the work are freely coming in. We thank the Lord for the liberality of His people. When the Lord graciously reveals Himself to us, we ought to praise Him.",
