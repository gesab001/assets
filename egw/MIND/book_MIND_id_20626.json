    "word": "We know that there is a question whether the Bible should be brought in as one branch of the education. Why, it should be the main branch. We think that the Bible contains a knowledge of the very highest and loftiest science, and why should we not make it, as we are making it, a speciality in educating the children. We know skepticism and infidelity are dwelling in our land and we want to bring up the youth that they will become acquainted with history and there is nothing that can elevate the mind and understanding like the opening of their minds to the Scriptures.--Ms. 19, 1887, pp. 1, 2. (A sermon on \"A Practical Education,\" August 18, 1887.)",
