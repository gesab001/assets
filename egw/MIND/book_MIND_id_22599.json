    "word": "The \"joy fulfilled in themselves.\" What does it mean? Why, I get up in the morning, [and] I don't feel any particular joy. When I wake up, I don't feel that wonderful joy; perhaps some days, sometimes I do. But then what? Looking unto Jesus, who is the author and finisher of our faith, I begin to look up to Jesus for His presence, His light, and His love. A very simple thing. I thank God that He has kept me through the night. I am so thankful that He is a living Saviour. I am so grateful that He lives to make intercession for me; that He is \n\n\n                                    -206- \n\nnot in Joseph's new tomb. He is a living Saviour and ready to bless me. Well then, I believe that He means I shall be blessed. He died for me that I might be blessed, and that His joy might remain in me, therefore I keep my mind in that channel. I educate it; I train my tongue; I train my thoughts; I train all that there is of me that I may fasten it upon Jesus Christ.",
