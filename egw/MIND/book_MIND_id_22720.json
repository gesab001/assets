    "word": "We may search for the truth as those have in past ages, thinking that we have a flood of light and yet only comprehend a small portion of the real instruction, the efficiency, and the fullness contained in the Scriptures. But when we search with our heart and mind put to the utmost test, we shall know for ourselves what we must do that we may have eternal life, for in the Bible there is something to meet the wants of each one. An invisible Instructor will be by our side, and we will find that the Author of this Word is not only the Author but the Finisher of our faith. His Word standeth fast from everlasting to everlasting, and we want to learn from it lessons of eternal interest.",
