    "word": "We do not know what work God has for us to do, we cannot tell, unless we begin with the very talents He has given us. If we have only the one talent and we begin to put that to the exchangers, and then we begin to work with that one talent, and God sees that we are faithful in that which is least, then He will give us another talent. And then as we use that to the glory of God, and we are all the time centering in Christ as the branch is centered in the vine, drawing our sap and our nourishment from Jesus Christ, then we are in a position to bless all who come into connection with us. And thus the talent keeps increasing and growing; and the more we put it to the exchangers the more talents we have to employ to the glory of God. Now, brethren, we do not half understand the lessons that Christ has given us--the most precious lessons--and we want to understand them more and more. We want to come to Christ and ask Him to enlighten our minds, to give us spiritual eyesight, that we may know more of the truth.",
