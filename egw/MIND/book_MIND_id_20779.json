    "word": "I cannot say to the sinner, It will be well with thee. God's curse will rest upon the evildoer. God has sent message upon message to bring those who were regarded as responsible men and women into harmony with His mind, but they were so intent to carry out their own ideas and move forward in their own judgment that they did not hear His voice nor heed His message. Their own ways and their own unsanctified judgment seemed more pleasing to them than to lift the cross, deny self, and follow Jesus wheresoever He may lead.",
