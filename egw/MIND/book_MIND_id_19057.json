    "word": "Let the workers remember that their spirit and their actions have a powerful influence on the minds of those whom they meet. Let them feel their dependence on God. It is only when we place ourselves in His hands, to be worked by His Spirit, that He can use us in breaking the power of the enemy over souls. Let them remember, too, that to those with whom they become acquainted in this work they are to speak of the love of the Saviour, who, though He was rich, \n                                                                           25\nyet for our sakes became poor, that we might be rich. He gave Himself to a life of lowliness, poverty, and privation, that He might know how to reach every suffering child of His. In all our afflictions He is afflicted. \"He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.\" Isaiah 53:5. Let us follow where He leads the way, denying self, and taking up the cross. As we share His humiliation is this life, partaking with Him in His suffering, we are preparing to share His glory in the future life. \n\n                                               -",
