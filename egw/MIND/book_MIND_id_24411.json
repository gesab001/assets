    "word": "The simplicity of the work of the Messiah gave unmistakable evidence of His mission. He swept away the errors that existed in the religious world with a confidence and tact that could not be gainsaid. He would have truth stand out clear and free from every error with which Satan would try to enshroud it. He presented heaven-born principles so clearly before the minds of the people, that the way to heaven was made clear and plain, and he who missed the way had no excuse.",
