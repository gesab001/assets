    "word": "I have just had to hire fifteen hundred dollars from the bank in order to relieve Elder Haskell in a situation that was forced upon Him. It related to a business transaction connected with the Buena Vista property. A lot containing over seventeen acres of land, situated next to the school property, one of our workers was thinking of purchasing for the purpose of establishing a cripples' Home, but was not willing to pay more than fifteen hundred dollars for it. The land could not be secured for less than two thousand. After the purchase was made, Brother Vaughan felt that he could not pay more than fifteen hundred dollars, and so the property was left on Elder Haskell's hands. We \n                                                                           333\nfelt that we could not let this piece of land go back into the hands of unbelievers, and Elder Haskell asked me if I would not buy it. I consented to do this, and the place is now in my name. To do this I have hired fifteen hundred dollars from the bank at eight percent. Now Elder Haskell's mind will be relieved, and he will not need to worry any longer. We do not know for what this piece of land will be used. It would make a splendid site for a church, but that matter can be decided later.",
