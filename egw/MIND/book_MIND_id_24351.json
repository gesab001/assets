    "word": "Extracts from letter B.53 '05, dated February 2, 1905. \n\n\n     If only our souls will be converted from the error of their ways, and seek the Lord, and learn the science of preserving the health of the body and the soul! And where can they learn these much-needed lessons as well as at our sanitarium, which the Lord has said should be established in many places? Lectures might be given to the multitudes, but while the words spoken would enlighten many minds, how can people understand fully without a practical knowledge? One patient, successfully treated, will have a testimony to bear of the virtue of the simple methods of treatment, the simple, healthful remedies that nature has provided, without the use of drugs.",
