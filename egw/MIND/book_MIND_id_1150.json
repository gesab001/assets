To undertake to do double work means with many, overtaxation of the mind, and a neglect of proper physical exercise. It is not reasonable to suppose that the mind can grasp and digest an oversupply of mental food, and it is as great a sin to overfeed the mind as it is to load the digestive organs, giving the stomach no periods of rest. The brain is the citadel of the whole man, and wrong habits of eating, dressing, or sleeping, affect the brain, and prevent the attaining of that which the student desires,--a good mental discipline. Any part of the body that is not treated with consideration will telegraph its injury to the brain. There should be exercised much patience and perseverance in instructing the youth how to preserve their health. They should become well informed on this matter, that every muscle and organ may be so strengthened and disciplined that in voluntary or involuntary action, the best of health may result, and the brain be invigorated to sustain the taxation of study.",
