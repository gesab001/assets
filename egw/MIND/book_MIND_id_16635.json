    "word": "The Cleansed Life an Effective Example--The teacher whose soul is stayed upon Christ will speak and act like a Christian. Such a one will not be satisfied until the truth cleanses his life from every unessential thing. He will not be satisfied unless his mind is day by day molded by the holy influences of the Spirit of God. Then Christ can speak to the heart, and His voice, saying, \"This is the way; walk ye in it,\" will be heard and obeyed.--FE 526.",
