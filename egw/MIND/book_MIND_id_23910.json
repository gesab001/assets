    "word": "\"Let nothing be done through strife of vain glory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than himself. . . . Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus: who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. . . . Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Do all things without murmurings and disputings: that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.\" \n                                                                           132",
