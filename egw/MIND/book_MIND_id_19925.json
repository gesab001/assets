    "word": "Satan is watching all the outposts, to see where he can steal an entrance. For years he has been working with all his deceivableness of unrighteousness to find standing-room in the Review and Herald publishing house. And he has found it. He has been allowed to come into the very place that should ever have been regarded as a sacred, holy place, the temple of God, from which the Lord would send forth clear, bright rays of light to all parts of the world. Satan has succeeded in placing in the hands of the employees of our publishing houses a class of literature that is prepared to deceive, if possible, the very elect. Matter containing dangerous errors has been brought into our office of publication, and these errors have been perpetuated by being printed on our presses and published in book form. These \n\n\n                                    -278- \n\nprinciples of evil have influenced the minds of those who have handled this matter. As a result souls will be lost to the cause of God. Already some have nearly lost their sense of discernment between truth and error.",
