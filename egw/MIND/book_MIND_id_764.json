As if he were able to discern the workings of her mind, he addressed her: \u201cYea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\u201d Eve was surprised and startled as she thus seemed to hear the echo of her thoughts. . . .

And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\u201d. . .",
