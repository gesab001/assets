    "word": "Do not place yourself in a position to be constantly weary; for God does not place you there. I have been shown in your case as in that of others of our brethren that you make mistakes in your manner of labor; and the reason why I feel urged upon to keep this matter before you is you are blind to these mistakes yourself. When you begin an effort you load yourself down with many burdens that are not essential to the present work, but only hinder it. You feel that the Lord lays these upon you and that He calls and directs your mind in many things, when He does not do this; it is the working out of a nervous, intensely active temperament, which in a great degree defeats the very purpose and work which you so much desire to do.",
