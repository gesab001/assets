    "word": "Those placed in positions of trust should have connected with them as helpers men whose minds do not run in exactly the same lines as their own. To every man has been given talents, according to his several abilities. One mind may have a larger scope than another. When men are linked together, each supplies the other's deficiency, and thus they are a complete whole. But one man cannot bear the responsibilities which necessarily fall upon him if he is placed in sacred office. God would have His people linked together, doing His work in perfect harmony.--Manuscript 55, 1897, p. 3.",
