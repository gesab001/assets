    "word": "There are many who spend their money for that which is not bread--for tea, coffee, the large use of flesh meats. All of these produce their sure results in painful affliction. Many animals have been butchered, when their blood was in a high state of fever, apparently boiling with madness. Those who eat of these meats are subject to inflammation and blood-poisoning. Some have distressing spasms, some have great distress of the bowels. It is the work of the physician to educate those who are ignorant in regard to these things. There should be training-schools to educate nurses and prepare the minds to sense the danger and to see the importance of bringing in skill and tact in the preparation of foods which shall be substituted for the meat diet. This kind of education will pay in the end. Wisdom should be used not to remove meat all at once from those who have been in the habit of using it, but educate the mind to see the importance of the use of healthful foods.",
