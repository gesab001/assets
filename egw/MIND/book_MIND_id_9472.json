    "word": "PRAY FOR GRACE FOR EACH DAY\u2019S NEEDS.\u2014The truth of God received into the heart is able to make you wise unto salvation. In \n161\nbelieving and obeying it you will receive grace sufficient for the duties and trials of today. Grace for tomorrow you do not need. You should feel that you have only to do with today. Overcome for today; deny self for today; watch and pray for today; obtain victories in God for today. Our circumstances and surroundings, the changes daily transpiring around us, and the written word of God which discerns and proves all things\u2014these are sufficient to teach us our duty and just what we ought to do, day by day. Instead of suffering your mind to run in a channel of thought from which you will derive no benefit, you should be searching the Scriptures daily and doing those duties in daily life which may now be irksome to you, but which must be done by someone.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, 333.)",
