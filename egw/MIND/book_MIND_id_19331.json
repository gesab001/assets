    "word": "Jesus has said, \"Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\" (Matthew 7:7). It is in proportion to our appreciation of the necessity and value of spiritual things that we seek for their attainment. \"Without Me ye can do nothing,\" says Jesus, and yet many think that \n\n\n                                    -334- \n\nman can do very much in his own finite strength and wisdom. Satan is ready to offer his counsel that he may win souls in the game of life. When men do not feel the need of counseling with their brethren, something is wrong; they trust to their wisdom. It is essential that brethren should counsel together. This I have been compelled to urge for the last forty-five years. Again and again the instruction has been repeated that those who are engaged in important work in the cause of God should not walk in their own ideas, but counsel together. They may regard their plans as without a flaw, but other minds may be enlightened on some points where they cannot see, or may take heed to suggestions and counsels of those who see not the truth. The Lord may have plans of a different order, not after the plans of finite man.",
