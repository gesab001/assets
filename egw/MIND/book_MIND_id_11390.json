    "word": "There are many young men in this age who will search the Scriptures as for hidden treasures, and having found jewels of truth, will open up the treasures of the word to the minds of others. . . . \"Ye are strong\" comprehends more than mere physical strength. It means that the mind has been trained to think, and has been kept clear and strong by the practice of strictly temperate habits. It means that the young men have engaged with earnestness, and have overcome the enemy, connecting the religion of Jesus Christ with every-day life, and bringing Christ into their every-day duties and enjoyments. It means that they have become partakers of the divine nature.",
