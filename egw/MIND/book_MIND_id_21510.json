    "word": "Basel, Nov. 22, 1885. I attended the morning meeting of the workers in the office, prayed with them and spoke to them about thirty minutes upon the necessity of faithfulness. I think many felt deeply upon this matter, for I know there have been influences that have drawn their minds from devotion and heart service to God, to having their affection and their interest divided, placing human objects where the Lord alone should rule and reign. A request was made for all who would from this time make most earnest efforts to reach a higher standard, to arise. All arose. We hope this now will have the effect to win them to God and to heavenly reflections and make earnest efforts to be all that God has given them power to be--faithful and true devoted soldiers of the cross of Christ. How my heart is drawn out for these young men.",
