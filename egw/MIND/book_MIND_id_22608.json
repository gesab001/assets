The Jews had sent him to Christ hoping they could find something whereby they could catch Christ in His words. The question was put on the lawyer's lips by the scribes and the Pharisees, but, said Christ, \"What saith the law and the prophets? How readest thou?\" (See Luke 10:26.)

No. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength\" (Mark 12:30). All there is of us. \"And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\" (v. 31).",
