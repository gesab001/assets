    "word": "God calls upon you to act your part with fidelity and guard the interests of the church with which you are connected. Work with an eye single to the glory of God. Keep pressing your way to the light and you will have light. Talk faith, and you will have faith. Seek for harmony. Seek to be of one mind, of one judgment, thus answering the prayer of Christ. Leave not all the agonizing prayer to be poured forth day and night by your soul-burdened president and a few faithful standard-bearers.",
