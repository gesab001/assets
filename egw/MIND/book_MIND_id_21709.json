    "word": "While Brother Daniel may be particular, difficult, and critical (which evil he needs to correct to be properly balanced), there are ministers who never go deep enough. They do not critically and carefully examine important subjects in order to become acquainted with the real difficulties, but assert and affirm in a talkative, boasting, manner and let this answer for proof. Their minds are not disciplined by patient study and deep thought, and what they take for granted they express without much effort or depth of knowledge. They are glib talkers but not deep thinkers; they are fluent in words, but as far as real knowledge is concerned, they merely skim over the surface of things, gathering a little here and there but not having a deep fund or fountain to draw from. \n\n\n                                   -10-",
