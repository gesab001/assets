    "word": "Your daughter Daisy is a very promising child. She attracts notice and praise and flattery from others and all praise her for her smartness; but be very careful that you do not administer to her vanity. When you have guests, you can say to your children, Now I wish to visit with my friends and you must amuse yourself. Daisy is 4(?) years old, a very nice little girl and her perceptions are large. She will form habits rapidly. You can, when you have special visiting to do with your friends, say that she must not disturb you by putting in her little sharp voice to distract your mind, and you lose all the benefit it is your privilege to have. It will be just as you shall manage the matter. You held the lines and a little whip and were carrying on an imaginary driving a horse. Your voice [was] heard in directing and etc., then her voice was constantly interspersed in the conversation and a laugh. It was a mixing of the common and sacred in such a way that it was a most painful interview to me, for you could not possibly have been able to get clear ideas of what I was trying to say to you, and could not be a reliable one to communicate that which was said.",
