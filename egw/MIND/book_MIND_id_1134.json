Says the psalmist, \"The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\" [Psalm 119:130.] The question has often been asked me, \"Should the Bible become the important book in our schools?\" It is a precious book, a wonderful book.

It is an endowment of God that should awaken in every heart the most sincere gratitude; for it is the revelation of God to man.",
