    "word": "I saw that many souls have been destroyed by their brethren unwisely sympathizing with them, when their only hope was to be left to see and realize the full extent of their wrongs. But as they eagerly receive the sympathy of unwise brethren, they receive the idea that they are abused; and if they attempt to retrace their steps, they make half-hearted work. They divide the matter to suit their natural feelings, lay blame upon the reprover, and so patch up the matter. It is not healed, it is not probed to the bottom, and they fall into the same wrong again, because they were not left to feel the extent of their wrong and humble themselves before God, and let him build them up. False sympathizers have worked in direct opposition to the mind of Christ and ministering angels.",
