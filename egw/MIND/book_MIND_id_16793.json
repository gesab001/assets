    "word": "Subject From Holy Spirit for Special Occasion-- On Sunday, June 23, [1895], I spoke under the tent at Canterbury. A general meeting had been appointed, and many of our people were present from Ashfield, Sydney, and Petersham. Several souls were convinced of the truth who had not fully decided to obey. As I entered the desk I could not seem to fasten my mind upon any subject upon which to speak, but as soon as I rose to my feet, everything was clear, and the text given me was the question of the lawyer to Christ--\"What shall I do \n                                                                           403\nthat I may have eternal life?\"",
