    "word": "We are not in this school work to make money; we are here to give the youth a well-balanced education. To this end they must educate their muscles as well as their minds for service.

We want this school to stand forth as an example in every way; these buildings should be perfect in their equipment.--Ms. 31, 1909, pp. 4, 5. (\"Industrial Cooperation,\" April 17, 1909.)",
