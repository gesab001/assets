    "word": "Controlling the Imagination \n\n     You should control your thoughts. This will not be an easy task; you cannot accomplish it without a close and even severe effort. Yet God requires this of you; it is a duty resting upon every accountable being. You are responsible to God \n                                                                           76\nfor your thoughts. If you indulge in vain imaginations, permitting your mind to dwell upon impure subjects, you are, in a degree, as guilty before God as if your thoughts were carried into action. All that prevents the action is the lack of opportunity.",
