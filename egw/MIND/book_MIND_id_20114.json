    "word": "In no case should men handling sacred responsibilities so misrepresent the Lord's purpose concerning His work as to say arbitrarily to a fellow-worker, You shall not do this, or You must do that. By His Holy Spirit the Lord impresses His workers to go to certain places, and to do a certain work. He does not desire to have the human mind interpose itself to forbid any work that He has bidden shall be carried forward.--Letter 88, 1908, pp. 5, 6. (To H. W. Cottrell and S. N. Haskell, February 16, 1908.)",
