If you are a necessity where you are, then I would not in any way make duties for you. If the time has not yet arrived for you to leave your present situation, then continue where you are till you see your duty in this matter. The Lord has promised to give us wisdom on condition that we accept Him as our Guide and Counselor, and ask of Him with unwavering faith.",
