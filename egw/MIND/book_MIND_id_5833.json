    "word": "The Importance of Watchfulness and Prayer\n     Dear Brethren and Sisters: Our meetings are about to close, and we are soon to separate, some to return to their homes, and others to their various fields of labor. What will be the effect of these good meetings? Will you cherish the precious light that God has here given, and let it have a sanctifying influence upon your lives? Will you, as you assemble from week to week in your little meetings at home, reflect upon others the rays of light that have shone upon you? Will your mind and conversation be upon the blessings of heaven, whence you look for your Saviour; or will you again be absorbed with things of a temporal nature? You have received additional light, and you will doubtless be beset by more severe temptations than ever before. The enemy will manufacture difficulties and create influences by which to discourage and overcome you if possible. But by watchfulness and prayer and faith in Christ you may be victors.",
