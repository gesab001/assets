    "word": "To Rightly Divide the Word of Truth \n\n\n     The Scripture is all true, but by misapplying the Scripture men arrive at wrong conclusions. We are engaged in a mighty conflict, and it will become more close and determined, as we near the final struggle. We have a sleepless adversary, and he is constantly at work upon human minds, who have not had a personal experience in the teachings of the people of God for the last fifty years. Some will take the truth applicable to their time, and place it in the future. Events in the train of prophecy that had their fulfillment away in the past are made future, and thus by these theories the faith of some is undermined. Ms 31, 1896, p. 3. (\"Testimony Concerning the Views of Prophecy Held by Brother John Bell,\" November 8, 1896.)",
