    "word": "I remember one of our workers who some years ago came to the institution in St. Helena. He was so weak he felt he could not arise from his bed. The physician in charge of the case told me, \"I see no hope for him unless we can get him off from the bed and make use of his limbs and his mind in some way.\" I advised the doctor to persuade the patient to dress himself for a short walk for the purpose of asking him his opinion about something. It proved to be a difficult matter to get him off his bed, but he succeeded, and again the next day, he went a little farther. After three weeks, the man needed no further urging, and he soon acquired a good appetite for hygienic food. This was seventeen years ago, and the man is still alive, strong in brain, bone, and muscle.",
