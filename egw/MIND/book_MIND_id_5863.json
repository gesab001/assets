    "word": "Return to Switzerland\n     On the 16th of November we left Christiania, on our return to Switzerland. William had parted from us a few days before, going by the way of the North Sea to England, and thence to America, to attend the General Conference. We had seen the necessities of the cause in the different European fields, and were impressed with the great need of means and laborers; and as we neared the time for General Conference, he felt that it was his duty to attend; that he could best serve the cause by presenting in person the wants of these mission fields, and assisting to arrange some business matters for the mission publishing-houses. When the matter of his going was first mentioned, I could not consent; but prayerful consideration convinced me that God had put this into his mind, and I would not bid him stay. Accordingly he left us at Christiania, and Bro. H. W. Kellogg accompanied our party on the return to Basle.",
