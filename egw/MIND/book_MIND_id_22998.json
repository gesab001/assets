    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has done a work that no man I know of among us has had qualifications to do. He has needed the sympathy and confidence of his brethren. There should have been a tender compassion for him in his position of trust, and they should have pursued a course that would have gained and retained his confidence. God would have it thus. But there has been, instead, a spirit of suspicion and criticism. If the doctor fails in doing \n                                                                           104\nhis duty and being an overcomer at last, those brethren who have failed in their want of wisdom and discernment to help the man when and where he needed their help, will be in a large measure responsible, for there have [been] but few [who have] faithfully warned him in kindness and love for his soul, but hurt him with their thrusts behind his back. His brethren do at times really feel that God is using the doctor to do a work that no other one is fitted to do; but when they meet so strong a current of reports to his detriment, [they] are perplexed; they partially accept them, and decide that Dr. Kellogg must really be hypocritical and dishonest. They do not consider the good he has done and that he is doing. They do not look at his efforts to elevate the religious and moral tone at the Sanitarium, and keep it up to a high standard. How must the doctor feel to be ever regarded with suspicion? Can nothing be done to change this order of things? Must it ever be thus? I know that it is not right. There are things that will occur in connection with the Sanitarium that will need much wisdom to plan and arrange, and here is where other minds must come in to place things as God would have them.",
