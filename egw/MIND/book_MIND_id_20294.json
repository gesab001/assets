    "word": "Many think themselves wonderfully wise in understanding the sentiments of infidel writers, but they will find that they are building upon a sandy foundation. They are not building upon the solid Rock. The storm of persecution, the storm of trial comes, and sweeps away that foundation, and they have nothing upon which to stand. What we want is to rivet our souls to the Eternal Rock. We don't want our students to feel themselves so smart that they think they know everything worth knowing. We have not yet begun to know the Bible. You have your mind upon this, upon that, and upon the other, and it is filled with so much that is of no importance that the very truth that will make you wise unto salvation, you know scarcely anything about. What \n\n\n                                  -68- \n\nwe want is to become strong men and women.",
