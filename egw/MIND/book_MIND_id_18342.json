    "word": "\"Those engaged at the office should have no \n\n                      -26- \n\nseparate interest aside from the work. If that attention and care are given to the work in which they are engaged which it demands, they should not be further taxed. They have done all they should do. If trafficking which has no connection with the work of God engages the mind and occupies time, the work will not be done thoroughly and well. At the best, those employed in the work have no physical and mental energy to spare. They are to a greater or less degree enfeebled. Such a cause, such a sacred work, in which they are employed, should engage the powers of the mind; they should not work mechanically, but be sanctified to the work, and act as though the cause was a part of them, as though they had invested something in this great and solemn work. Unless they thus take hold of this matter with interest, their efforts will not be acceptable to God.",
