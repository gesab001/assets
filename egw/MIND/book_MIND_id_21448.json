    "word": "You have been infatuated. You have exalted Sister Johnson in your mind far higher than she deserved. She has not, in her troubles, made God her strength and burden bearer. She has fled to human aid which could not avail her. She is not devotional or a godly woman. She lacks humility, religion, and a spirit of perseverance, and is not a person who can exert a correct religious influence upon your children and take care or manage with calmness when placed in disadvantageous circumstances.",
