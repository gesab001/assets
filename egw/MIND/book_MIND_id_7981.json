    "word": "Minute by Minute.--There is one thing that I want to caution you about. Do not fret or worry; it does not pay to do this. Do not try to do too much. If you do not undertake too much, you will succeed in accomplishing much more than if you try to carry out too many plans.  Constantly bear in mind the words of Christ, \"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation\" (Mark 14:38). Christ is your personal Saviour. Believe that His saving power is exercised in your behalf minute by minute, hour by hour. He is by your side in every time of need.--Lt 150, 1903.",
