Belden, Ellen White's nephew.) \n\n\n     Since our last conversation with you my mind has been drawn to you instinctively. I have earnest hope that you will not allow the present opportunity to slip, of making a determined effort to recover yourself from the snare of the devil. You are the child of my dear sister.
