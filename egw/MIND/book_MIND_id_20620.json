    "word": "Thursday, February 13, 1896--In the afternoon Professor Prescott and wife again visited me in my room. We had a long talk in regard to the management of school matters. As questions were asked the Holy Spirit revived many things in my mind, and I could tell them the way many matters concerning our educational interest had been presented to me. We are to lay the situation of dearth of means before the whole school and then make known the Lord's plan as presented to me. In place of devoting time to inventing amusements to use their muscles, they can strengthen nerves and muscles to good advantage in the work that needs to be done on the school grounds. If we shall be compelled to hire the work done, the price of tuition must be increased. Every student may consider it to be his privilege to have a part in saving means they would pay for hiring work done, that themselves can do. Earning their expenses is to be considered a part of their education. Every \n\n\n                                  -114- \n\nstudent is to exercise brain and bone and muscle. Here is the education of the whole man, right on the ground--an education essential for all, for there is work for all to do. . . .",
