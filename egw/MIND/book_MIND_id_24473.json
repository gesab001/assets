    "word": "Do not be disappointed if we do not come just now. I do not know of a place where I should be more pleased to be for a time than in Loma Linda. I could enjoy every bit of the scenery and all the advantages. The reason my coming may be doubtful is that I do not wish to leave my workers just at this stage of my work. I am in good health for me; better than I have been in for years, and while my mind is clear, I want nothing to interpose as an extra burden. I want every jot and tittle of my strength to reproduce the representations the Lord has given me, and to make them as vivid as possible while I can do so. This is the only reason I plead not to leave my workers. We have all the multitudinous productions of the pen to be placed in the best order to handle, and I am more than pleased with the care that is manifested in arranging everything so that it may be well prepared for me to use.",
