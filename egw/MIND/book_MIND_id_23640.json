    "word": "Let no plans or methods be brought into any of our institution that will bind minds or talents under the control of human judgment, for this is not in God's order. God has given to men talents of influence which belong to him alone, and no greater dishonor can to be done to God than for one finite agent to purchase from men their God-given talent, or the product of such talent, to be absolutely under his control, even though the benefits of the same be used to the advantage of the cause. In such arrangements one man's mind is ruled by another man's mind, and the human agency is separated from God, and exposed to temptation. Satan's methods tend to one end, to make men the slaves of men. And when this is done, confusion and distrust, jealousies and evil surmisings, are the result. Such a course destroys man's faith in God, and in the principles which are to control, to purge from guile and from every species of selfishness and hypocrisy.",
