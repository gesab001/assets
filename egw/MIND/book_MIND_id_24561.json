    "word": "It has been repeatedly presented before me that God is observing every transaction in that office. \"Thou God seest me,\" should be ever in mind; courtesy and Christian politeness should be exercised by every one who bears responsibilities in the office. They should have a sense of the encroachment upon others' rights which is so common in the world's practice, but which is an offense to God. The board of directors should ever act as under the divine eye, with a continual sense that they are finite men, and are liable to make mistakes in judgment, decisions, and plans, unless they are closely connected with God, and seeking to have every deficiency removed from their characters. As they are only weak and erring men themselves they should feel kindness and pity for others who may err. The divine standard must be met. You should take the Lord with you into every one of your councils. If you sense that God is in your assemblies every transaction will be conscientiously carefully and prayerfully considered. Every unprincipled act will be repressed, and uprightness will characterize the dealings in small as well as in large matters. There should be cultivation of universal kindness with the workers. First seek counsel of God, for this is necessary for you to properly counsel together.",
