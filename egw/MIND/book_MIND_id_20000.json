    "word": "Your husband will live in the hearts of those who love God. As time passes you will miss him more and more. May the Lord strengthen and comfort and bless you. The Lord Jesus will be to you an ever present help in time of need. On Him you may rely. His death and resurrection are to be ever kept fresh in the minds of those who receive and believe in Him as their Redeemer. The resurrection of Christ is the assurance of our salvation. He is the source of our life. \"Because I live, ye shall live also.\" We have a living Saviour. In this we may all rejoice. Christ is not in Joseph's new tomb, but is our friend at court, pleading in our behalf. Approach your Saviour with full assurance of faith; for He ever liveth to make intercession for you. Upon Him you may depend for comfort and peace.",
