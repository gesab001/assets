    "word": "I arose early Thursday morning, about two o'clock, and was writing busily upon the True Vine, when I felt a presence in my room, as I have many times before, and I lost all recollection of what I was about. I seemed to be in the presence of Jesus; He was communicating to me that in which I was to be instructed. Everything was so plain that I could not misunderstand. I was to help one whom I thought I should never be called upon to be troubled with again. I could not understand what it meant; but at once decided not to try to reason about this, but follow the directions. Not an audible word was spoken to my ear, but to my mind. I said, Lord, I will do as Thou hast commanded.--Letter 36, 1896, p. 2. (To Elder S. N. Haskell, April 26, 1896.)",
