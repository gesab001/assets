    "word": "We need to appreciate more fully the meaning of the words, \"I sat down under His shadow with great delight.\" Song of Solomon 2:3. These words do not bring to our minds the picture of hasty transit, but of quiet rest. There are many professing Christians who are anxious and depressed, many who are so full of busy activity that they cannot find time to rest quietly in the promises of God, who act as if they could not afford to have peace and quietness. To all such Christ's invitation is, \"Come unto Me, . . . and I will give you rest.\" Matthew 11:28.",
