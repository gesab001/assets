    "word": "Elmshaven, Nov. 27, 1902. I am spending hours of the night, while others are asleep, in prayer. The past life is woven into your future. We must individually make every failure that appears thus a success, because we learned how to guard our minds, our words, our deportment. By looking unto Jesus, by beholding Him in His ministry, we shall become changed into His likeness in character, and then when imbued with His Holy Spirit we give glory to God in reflecting to others the grace bestowed upon us. Thus we declare the glory of God, by copying His character which we highly esteem and by being intensely in earnest to declare His excellencies in our own life character.",
