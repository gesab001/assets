Let those who have brought about the present state of confusion by making the division that exists, stop to consider seriously before going any farther. \"Choose you this day whom ye will serve.\" \"If the Lord be God, follow Him; but if Baal, then follow Him.\" \n\n\n                                       (Signed) \n\n\n                                                 Ellen G.

For months the situation has been impressed on my mind, and I urge that companies be organized and diligently trained to labor in our important cities. These workers should labor two and two, and from time to time all should meet together to relate their experiences, to pray, and to plan how to reach the people quickly, and thus if possible redeem the time.",
