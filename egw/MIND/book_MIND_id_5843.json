    "word": "If we could only see the many dangers from which we are daily preserved by the holy angels, instead of complaining of our trials and misfortunes, we would talk continually of the mercies of God. How precious in the sight of God are his people! If Satan had his way, whenever an effort is made to bring souls into the truth, both the minister and those who come to hear would be made to suffer in body and in mind. But angels of God are commissioned to accompany his servants, and to protect them and their hearers. Satan pleads for the privilege of separating these angels from them, that he may compass their destruction; but Jesus forbids it. If it were not for the constant guardianship of these angels, we would not be able to live on the earth and present the truth.",
