    "word": "So much work of a faulty nature has been done in the school at Huntsville that it will now require stern efforts to restore the work to healthfulness, but such efforts should be put forth. Many discouragements have come in, but the Lord will let His blessing rest upon those who will take hold of the work thoroughly and in earnest. There is a special need of intense earnestness. Take hold with heart and mind and strength to redeem the farm, that it may be, as it has been presented to me, a beautiful place, well pleasing to the Lord, a spectacle to angels and to men.",
