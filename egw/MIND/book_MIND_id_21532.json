    "word": "All are gathering up flower roots for me to make my wilderness home blossom as the rose. Already we have many flowers, but I have plenty of space, and have set it apart for flowers. I wish that my home shall be made beautiful by the things of nature that God has created. Generally I call the attention of the children to these beautiful flowers, and tell them that these things are an expression of the love of God for them. I direct their mind from nature to nature's God. These lessons always seem to touch the hearts of the parents as well as the children. The pulpit is often festooned with flowers of every variety, and beautiful bouquets are brought me.",
