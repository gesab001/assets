    "word": "I am pained to see the little value placed upon men whom the Lord has used, and whom he will use. God forbid that men's minds shall follow in the channel of another man's mind. One man's mind may be by some, exalted as being in every degree superior but every mind has its own peculiar weakness, and its peculiar strength. One man's mind will supply another man's deficiency. But if all work in the one harness, and are given encouragement to look, not to men to know their duty, but to God, they will develop under the Holy Spirit's guidance, and will work in unity with their brethren. One will supply another's lack.",
