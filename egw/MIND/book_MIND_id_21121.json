    "word": "This sacred, solemn trust should be carefully guarded, and wisely, judiciously used. Those who understand the principles of the gospel and the work of a physician should be encouraged to seek the Lord daily, as Christ's healer, His instrumentality of the soul as well as of the body, believing that He will give knowledge. Nothing will open doors for the truth like evangelistic medical missionary work. This will find access to hearts and minds, and will be a means of converting many to the truth.",
