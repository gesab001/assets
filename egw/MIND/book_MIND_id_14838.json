    "word": "Evil counselors were not wanting, who swayed that once noble, independent mind as they chose, because he did not make God his guide and counselor.

From the wisest king that ever swayed a scepter, Solomon became a despot. As a king he had been the idol of the nation, and that which he said and did was copied. His example exerted an influence the result of which can be fully known only when the works of all shall come in review before God, and every man shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body.",
