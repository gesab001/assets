    "word": "For some length of time Sister Johnson's affections were weaned from her husband and transferred to another. Brother Albert has thought that she would make a good mother to his children. He is mistaken. She is not a woman with a hopeful turn of mind. She walks in a shadow, lacks patience, is fretful and peevish, often to her own child, and she could not begin to fill the place that one should in that family. That stricken flock need one with amiable traits of character, hopeful, cheerful, forgiving, with a great fount of affection; one who will form their characters not for the world but for heaven.",
