    "word": "You have been receiving a mold of character which is not favorable to religious growth. You will need more of Jesus, less of self. You will need to guard against sharp practices in dealing with brethren and with those not of our faith. These words should be written on the tablets of the soul, \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" Look not on your own things, but upon the things of others [cf. Philippians 2:4]. It would be well in matters of deal if you would put yourself in the place of the one you are dealing with, and watch unto prayer lest a sharp spirit come in, selfishness have a controlling power over your mind, and your soul become tarnished.",
