    "word": "Sunday, December 28, 1890 \n\n     In company with Elder Washburn, Sarah McEnterfer and I left Washington at nine o'clock for Baltimore to meet a previous appointment at eleven o'clock.

They had been waiting one hour, fearing that we would not come. How rejoiced were our brethren to see us!",
