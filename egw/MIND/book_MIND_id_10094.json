    "word": "Our Washing and Ironing Time \n\n     We know in whom we believe.  Men may talk about our having our minds fixed too much upon heaven, but we know better.  We have been in the work nearly forty-eight years, and we know something about God's service.  I know best what bereavement is when I stand here alone, when he who stood by my side, and on whose large affections I have leaned for thirty years, is gone, and yet I am not alone, for Christ is my helper. Oh, I wish the curtains could be rolled back and we could see Christ in His glory.  We are to be members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King.  Now it is our privilege to know that Christ is by our side as our helper.",
