    "word": "The Holy Spirit is a divine Teacher. If we will heed its lessons, we shall become wise unto salvation. But we need to guard well our hearts; for too often \n\n\n                                   -48- \n\nwe forget the heavenly instruction we have received, and seek to act out the natural inclinations of our unconsecrated minds. Each one must fight his own battle against self. Heed the teachings of the Holy Spirit. If this is done, they will be repeated again and again until the impressions are as it were lead on the rock forever.",
