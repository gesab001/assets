    "word": "God will not bless those who work without taking counsel with their brethren. All have a work to do. But we must view matters from every side. No one should receive the idea that God has appointed to any man the work of personally building up a sanitarium, even in a new field, without counseling with his brethren. Any one who supposes that in himself he is a complete whole, and that he can safely follow his own mind and judgment, is not to be trusted; for he is not walking in the light, as Christ is in the light. There are many who have false views of what they are doing. God desires those in His service to move wisely. He desires them to have clear ideas and deep spirituality, and to weigh carefully the motives which prompt them to action.",
