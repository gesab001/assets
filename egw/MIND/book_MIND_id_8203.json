    "word": "Unless you can see that Satan is the mastermind who has devised this science, it will not be as easy a matter as you suppose to separate from it, root and branch. The whole philosophy of this science is a masterpiece of \n\n716 \n\nsatanic deception. For your soul's sake, cut loose from everything of this order. Every time you put into the mind of another person ideas concerning this science, that you may gain control of his mind, you are on Satan's ground, decidedly cooperating with him. For your soul's sake, break loose from this snare of the enemy.--Lt 20, 1902. (2SM 349, 350.)",
