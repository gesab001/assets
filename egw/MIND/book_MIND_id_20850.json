    "word": "My mind is exercised day and night in regard to our missionary work. I am alarmed because there is so little genuine burden for perishing souls. The church knows her duty well, if she would only contemplate the situation. There is work to be done in home missionary efforts. There is work to be done in far-off lands. Why are there not hundreds giving themselves to the performance of the work, where [now] there is [but] one? The truth of God which they profess to believe should sanctify the soul, stirring every power that God has given them--the deep and living fountains of motives and sympathies, that they will cooperate with the heavenly intelligences. It is the Holy Spirit that accomplishes the work. [Said Jesus], \"Without Me, ye can do nothing\" [John 15:5]. Keep this before every congregation, that it is earnestness, wholeness of purpose, that God will accept.",
