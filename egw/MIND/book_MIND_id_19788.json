    "word": "Elder Andrews, when he was driving his oxen, had his Bible with him and he would take it out and read a few words and then think of these while he went on with his work. Thus he obtained a knowledge of the Scriptures and of the love of God to man. We can all have our Bibles with us and when we have a spare moment we can read a verse and thus keep our minds fixed upon God.--Manuscript 33, 1885. (Sermon, November 10, 1885.)",
