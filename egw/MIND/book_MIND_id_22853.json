White, Sabbath, August 27, 1909, Council Grove, Kansas, Camp Meeting.] \n\n\n     The first chapter of Daniel teaches the lesson that what we eat and drink has an influence upon the powers of the mind, and that if we would have healthful bodies and clear minds, we must be careful of our diet. If we are careless in this matter, and eat simply to gratify taste, the digestive organs are impaired, and the brain is confused, and neither can act their parts as fully as God intended they should.",
