    "word": "There was among some a spirit manifested in reference to the investigation of this controverted question that was not after God's order. If we have held as truth some points in doctrine that will not bear close criticism and investigation it is our duty--without revealing the spirit that the churches manifested, which was so unlike Christ, patiently to come to the Word of God in an humble, prayerful, inquiring mind. Then we need to be changed in spirit, to be converted. The truth will lose nothing of its force or beauty or power through research, testing every point which we have considered as truth, if we preserve the meekness of Christ in our research. The Word of God will be found a treasure-house full of precious gems. We may draw from this storehouse very much more than we have done, and may be made wise unto salvation. \n                                                                           826",
