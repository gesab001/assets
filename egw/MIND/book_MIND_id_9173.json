    "word": "Training contributes to church growth notwithstanding the pastor's administrative responsibilities.--From the time that converts come together in church capacity, they should be educated to take up such lines of work as will not only benefit their own souls, but the souls of others. \"The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.\" The Lord has given to His followers talents of intellect and energy and means. Those who are known to be men of well-balanced minds, who have the love and fear of God before them, should be appointed as elders and deacons; and through the exercise of the ability God has given them, they may grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. They may plan wisely, and educate the individual members of the church to act their part in trading with their Lord's talents. By a right use of their talents they may increase their efficiency in the cause of God. The church may be visited only occasionally by a minister, and yet be a growing church; for Jesus is our minister, and we are never to think that we are left alone. Jesus never forsakes the flock of His pasture. \"This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.\"--RH Jan. 17, 1893.",
