    "word": "I have seen that Satan's power over him has not been broken. Those who choose to sustain the man who so greatly dishonors God and has stood directly in the way of His work, will themselves become so deceived that their work will not be accepted by God.

The misrepresentations that Dr. Kellogg has made of the work God has given me to do, have made them infidels.--Letter 116, 1905, pp. 1,3,10. (To J. H. Kellogg, April 22, 1905.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. December 10, 1981",
