    "word": "Edson, I feel very anxious that you should be largely blessed in Battle Creek. Pay no attention to insult or depreciation, but just go forward in the discharge of your duty. Let your heart be full of generous sympathy for all who have made and are still making mistakes, and be very careful to make straight paths for your own feet. Bear in mind that the attributes most appreciated by the heavenly Father and by the crucified, risen, and ascended Saviour are love and purity.",
