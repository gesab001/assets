    "word": "We are preparing to enter the holy city. Keep this thought in mind all the time. There is a heaven of bliss before us. Keep thinking of this. And there is a joy that we may have in Christ even in this world. To those who keep His commandments He says, \u201cMy joy shall be in you, and your joy shall be full.\u201d Keep His commandments and live, and His law as the apple of thine eye. May God bless you all. If I never see you again on this earth, I hope that I shall see you in the kingdom of God.",
