    "word": "I have been repeatedly shown that all our institutions need to have a different class of minds connected with them. They need to be managed by men who are spiritually minded and who will not weave their own defective ideas and plans into their management. This work should not be left to men who will mingle the sacred with the common, and who will regard the work of God as being upon about the same level as earthly things, and to be managed in the same cheap way that they have been in the habit of managing their temporal affairs. Now, until there can be those connected with our institutions who have breadth of mind and who can lay broad plans in harmony with the growth of the work and its exalted character, the tendency will be to cheapen everything that is undertaken, and God will be dishonored through it.",
