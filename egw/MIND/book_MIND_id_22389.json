    "word": "We are to give special attention to the conversion of sinners. Now is the time for every soul to test his own case. It is the prevailing custom to look to human agencies for sympathy. There is called for a much stronger element of moral power. God's people are to live in the clear sense that they have a God to whom they are to go with all their troubles, but go not to human agencies. \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways\" (James 1:5-8).",
