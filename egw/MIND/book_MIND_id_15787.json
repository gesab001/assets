    "word": "Students should have a growing, expanding idea of what it means to be a Christian. To be a Christian means to be a learner in the school of Christ. It means the connecting of soul, mind, and body with divine wisdom. When this union exists between the soul and God, we are taught of God, who gives wisdom and knowledge. His Spirit imparts thoughts that are clear the holy, and gives the knowledge that lives through eternal ages. Those who are consecrated, diligent, . . . fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, will reap an eternal reward.",
