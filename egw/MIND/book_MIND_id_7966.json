    "word": "Impure Air Affects Mental Powers.--Many are continually complaining and suffering from various indispositions. This is almost always because they do not labor wisely or observe the laws of health. They frequently remain too much indoors, occupying heated rooms filled with impure air. There they apply themselves closely to study or writing, taking little physical exercise and having little change of employment. As a consequence the blood becomes sluggish and the powers of the mind are enfeebled. --4T 264 (1876).",
