    "word": "In every age, through periods of great light as well as great spiritual darkness, there is revealed in some a peevish disposition, a disposition to complain, to question, and find fault. The most marked evidences of God's workings have no effect upon their ideas; they become fault finders, accusers, sitting in judgment upon sacred things, which can only be spiritually discerned. With many the truth has but little power upon mind and character. It does not sanctify the receiver. Separate the truth from Jesus, and it is powerless. But when the truth is received as it is in Jesus, it has a telling power upon the whole man. A light goes forth from the genuine believer which has a power upon the heart, for it bears the divine credentials.",
