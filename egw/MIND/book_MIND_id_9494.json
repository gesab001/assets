    "word": "SATAN ENRAGED BY FERVENT PRAYER.\u2014Satan leads many to believe that prayer to God is useless and but a form. He well knows how needful are meditation and prayer to keep Christ\u2019s followers aroused to resist his cunning and deception. By his devices he would divert the mind from these important exercises, that the \n272\nsoul may not lean for help upon the Mighty One and obtain strength from Him to resist his attacks. I was pointed to the fervent, effectual prayers of God\u2019s people anciently. \u201cElias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly.\u201d Daniel prayed unto his God three times a day. Satan is enraged at the sound of fervent prayer, for he knows that he will suffer loss.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, 295.)",
