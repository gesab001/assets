    "word": "A good, strong mind to propose and counsel would be the greatest blessing the doctor could have. No one man's mind and judgment are sufficient to be a controlling power in any of our institutions; therefore, councils need to be held. But there are those who, when they come into council, no sooner hear a proposition than they take it for granted it is infallible, and stand ready to say, \"Yes,\" and vote for it without carefully weighing the matter, probing it, sifting it, testing it, and giving it the benefit of deliberate thought. Such persons are mere ciphers. You should be men of force of character and depth of thought, seeing the judicious enterprises and laying hold of them, but bringing all your plans to the divine Counselor.",
