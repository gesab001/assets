    "word": "The existing ignorance of God's word, among the people professedly Christian, is alarming. The youth in our public schools have been robbed of the blessings of holy things. \n                                                                           99\nSuperficial talk, mere sentimentalism, passes for instruction in morals and religion; but it lacks the vital characteristics of real godliness. The justice and mercy of God, the beauty of holiness, and the sure reward of rightdoing, the heinous character of sin, and the certainty of punishment, are not impressed upon the minds of the young.",
