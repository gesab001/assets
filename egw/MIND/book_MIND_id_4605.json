    "word": "A great lesson is to be learned when we understand our relation to God, and His relation to us. The words, \"Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price,\" should be hung in memory's hall, that we may ever recognize God's right to our talents, our property, our influence, our individual selves. We are to learn how to treat this gift of God, in mind, in soul, in body, that as Christ's purchased possession, we may do Him healthful, savory service.",
