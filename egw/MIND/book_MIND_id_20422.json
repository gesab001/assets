    "word": "I thank the Lord that I have slept more hours the past night--until 4:00 a.m. Wednesday I could not sleep after half past one a.m. My mind was burdened and in the visions of the night subjects were pressed upon my mind and I awoke. I could not find relief until I arose and commenced to trace upon paper that which burdened me, which in object lessons was presented before me. Thursday I slept until half past two o'clock and then I arose and again relieved my mind by writing.--Ms 74, 1894. (Diary, April 28, 1894.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. April 2, 1980",
