    "word": "The camp meetings which my husband attended were made special seasons of seeking the Lord. Every morning at an early hour the ministers assembled in the large tent, where we wrought to become of one mind. The question would be asked, Have we any personal difficulties to settle? If so, let us settle them. Let us not pass one day on this ground cherishing hard feelings against a brother. Let there be no evil speaking one of another; for this will greatly dishonor God. Let us by every means in our power seek to remove the alienation and differences that exist.",
