    "word": "We have a serious, solemn work to do for ourselves to cleanse our own souls from spot and stain if we will stand before the Son of man when He shall appear, acquitted of Him. We must be educators as well as reformers. To cut loose from everyone who errs and does not follow our own ideas is not doing as Christ is doing for us. We are all fallible, and need pity, forbearance, kindly consideration, and sympathetic love for those with whom we are connected. We are all unworthy of the love and confidence of God. If one errs, then after doing our whole duty to him or her in a Christlike manner, we are not to keep the disagreeable and objectionable things before our mind's eye, but to see what there is good and praiseworthy in them that we can think of and ponder over and speak of.",
