    "word": "MR No. 1447 - St. Helena Rural Health Retreat Not To Be Closed; Divine Counsel To Be Sought and Followed\n\n     (Written January 8, 1892, from North Fitzroy, Melbourne, Victoria, to \"Dear Brother and Sister Maxson.\") \n\n\n     Letters have come to me on the late steamer stating that a council has been held in regard to your taking hold and helping them in the St. Helena Rural Health Retreat, and that you made statements that you would go only on one condition, namely, that as soon as possible the Retreat be closed and an institution be started near Oakland. Did the Lord counsel you in this decision? Never! And you stated that you had a talk with me and I favored such a plan. You must have received a wrong impression, for I had no thoughts in my mind of the advisability of such a plan, and whatever impressions you received to favor the closing up of the Health Retreat were not from any words of mine, but because you wanted it so.",
