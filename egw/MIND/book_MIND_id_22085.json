    "word": "I entreat of you, my brother, to make straight work for time and for eternity. Do not rob God in the least measure. Take the truth of God in your hand and in your heart, in every transaction with your fellow men. Go under its escort to your place of business. There God will be near you in every settled, determined effort to apply the simple but searching maxims which come from heaven to guide men through all the highways, the byways, and the broad ways through this life to eternal glory. You are often troubled by the dishonesty and perversity of man. His crooked ways are an offense to you. His disregard of his word, the forfeiting of his promises, make you grieved and provoked. Well, Satan is pleased to have him do this way in order to tempt and discourage you. But then how do you, my brother, treat the Lord? Are you not disappointing \n\n\n                                     -372- \n\nHis expectations? Are you faithful and exact in your promises, and do you pay your vows to your Creator? Do you not withhold from the Lord His own portion that He has reserved for Himself? Will my brother, whom I respect, whose soul I value above gold and silver because it was purchased by human agony and the price of the blood of the Son of God, will you look carefully to all these things? You need expect but little of men except through the power and prevalence of truth, which is alone able to elevate his nature to its true dignity by its sanctifying, holy influence. The only means of purifying man from his defilement is to make him like-minded with God.--Letter 33, 1888. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nApril 12, 1990.
