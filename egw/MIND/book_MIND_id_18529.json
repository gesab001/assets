As the high priest sprinkled the warm blood upon the mercy-seat, while the fragrant cloud of incense ascended before God, so while we confess our \n\n\n                      -37- \n\nsins, and plead the efficacy of Christ's atoning blood, our prayers are to ascend to heaven, fragrant with the merits of our Saviour's character. Notwithstanding our unworthiness, we are ever to bear in mind that there is One that can take away sin, and save the sinner. Every sin acknowledged before God with a contrite heart, he will remove. This faith is the life of the church. As the serpent was lifted up in the wilderness by Moses, and all that had been bitten by the fiery serpents were bidden to look and live, so also the Son of Man must be lifted up, that \"whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\"",
