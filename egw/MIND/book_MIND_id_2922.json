    "word": "Teachers, trust in God and go forward. \"My grace is sufficient for thee\" (2 Corinthians 12:9), is the assurance of the Great Teacher. Catch the inspiration of the words, and never, never talk doubt and unbelief. Be energetic. There is no half-and-half service in pure and undefiled religion. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.\" Mark 12:30. The very highest sanctified ambition is demanded of those who believe the word of God.",
