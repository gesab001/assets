    "word": "Constantly we are to press upward and forward to the light. It is the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit that is of value with God. Ornaments of gold and silver are of value only to please the eye and to be commented upon. \"Looking unto Jesus,\" is the motto we are ever to keep in mind. \"Men shall be blessed in Him: all nations shall call Him blessed\" (Psalm 72:17). \n\n\n                                -244- \n\n\"Great shall be the peace of thy children\" (Isaiah 54:13). \"Blessed are the people whom Thou choosest\" (see Psalm 65:4). \"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. . . . For this shall every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found: Surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. Thou art my hiding place: Thou shalt preserve me from trouble: Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. . . . I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye\" (Psalm 32:1, 2, 6-8). These promises are the assurance of God.",
