    "word": "Throughout their journeyings, as they [the Israelites] complained of the difficulties in the way, and murmured against their leaders, Moses had told them, \u201cYour murmurings are against God. It is not I, but God, who has wrought in your deliverance.\u201d But his hasty words before the rock, \u201cShall we bring water?\u201d were a virtual admission of their charge. . . . The Lord would remove this impression forever from their minds, by forbidding Moses to enter the Promised Land. Here was unmistakable evidence that their leader was not Moses, but the mighty Angel of whom the Lord had said, \u201cBehold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,\n103\nand to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey his voice; . . . for my name is in him.\u201d\u2014PP 419.",
