    "word": "Brother Leon Smith, you are a young man and you need a much deeper experience in humbly walking with God. You need to be divested of self. You need to closely and critically examine your own heart that you will not make a mistake now, and consider your knowledge is greater than it really is. Our young men laboring \n                                                                           531\nin the cause of God need a thorough change of spirit, and to so humble their hearts before God that He can make them living channels of light. Jesus is waiting to open to their minds and hearts a new and living way that they have not walked in. He is waiting to open to them the riches of His glory and His divine grace in His methods of saving souls. When this shall take place, you, with other youth, will be astonished at your present ideas of what constitutes a religious life. You will see you are way above the simplicity of true godliness. You will see the meekness and lowliness of Christ has not formed an important part in your religious experience. You have yet to learn to imitate the humble example of Jesus Christ. All pride, all lofty ideas, will disappear and Christ will be revealed as the Sanctifier.",
