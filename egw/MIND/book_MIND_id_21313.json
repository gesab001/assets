    "word": "St. Helena, California, Wednesday, August [?], 1907 \n\n     I cannot sleep after twelve o'clock. There are many things that are brought before me which I wish to remember. I place myself in writing position. My mind has been greatly wrought upon during the night. I was in a meeting in Colorado. I seemed to be in the meetinghouse, and there were some things that were to be considered away from the sanitarium and away from the campground. One was in our midst full of wisdom, and we were to hear His words. He said words that were appropriate for the occasion. This instruction was of that character that all would understand and could not turn aside. The lessons He gave were full of knowledge for all who would attentively practice them.",
