    "word": "43\n \n\nDelegating\n\n     Place Responsibility on Others--Leading men should place responsibilities upon others, and allow them to plan and devise and execute, so that they may obtain an experience.  Give them a word of counsel when necessary, but do not take away the work because you think the brethren are making mistakes.  May God pity the cause when one man's mind and one man's plan is followed without question.  God would not be honored should such a state of things exist.  All our workers must have room to exercise their own judgment and discretion.  God has given men talents which He means that they should use.  He has given them minds, and He means that they should become thinkers, and do their own thinking and planning, rather than depend upon others to think for them.",
