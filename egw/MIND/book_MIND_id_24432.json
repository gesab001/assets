    "word": "But ministers who bear the last message of mercy to fallen men must utter no random words; they must not open doors where by Satan shall find access to human minds. It is not our work to experiment, to study out something new and startling that will create excitement. Satan is watching his chance to take advantage of anything of this order that he may bring in his deceiving elements. The Holy Spirit moving upon the human agents, will keep the mind well balanced. There will not be a wrought up excitement, to be followed by re-action. Satan will make use of every extravagant expression to the injury, not only of the speaker but of those who shall catch the same spirit and infuse others to their harm. Calmness and solemnity should be cultivated; the solemn truths we dwell upon will lead us to manifest deep earnestness. How can we do otherwise when weighed with the most sacred message to bear to perishing souls, weighted by the sense of the nearness of our Saviour's coming.",
