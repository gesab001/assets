    "word": "I have written to Brother Harper that he ought not to take the matter so to heart. He feels like death over the thought that he must give you up, but in this sad case it is the best thing he can do. But do not then receive any money from him or expect him to defray your expenses. While you consent to receive his money of course it encourages him to be of the opinion that you will again live with him as his wife and be true to your marriage vows. But if you design to cut loose from him, it is in poor taste for you to accept anything financially from him. I see and sense your situation, and feel deeply for you, for I know with the position you take you must suffer in mind. But I am not pleased with your set and fixed purpose to carry out at all hazards your independent will. In doing this you will not bring happiness to yourself or to anyone else.",
