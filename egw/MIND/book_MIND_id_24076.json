    "word": "Sister White: There is one other point that I want Brother Reaser to keep in his mind, --perhaps he does not understand it fully. He has thought that Willie tells me. Now I am (525) up in the morning, you know, before any one else is up,--at one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, and seldom ever after four-- more often by three. Recently, for nights and nights and nights, I have seldom been able to sleep after two o'clock, but have been up, writing. I write out the presentations that the Lord has given me in the night season; and when, later on in the morning, Willie comes in to see me, I have already written many pages. Often the manuscript has been placed in the hands of one of my copyists, and is being written out, before he knows that I have written anything, or what I have written. After it is typewritten, a copy is often placed in his hands. It is not he that comes with things to me, but I give to him the light that I have received.",
