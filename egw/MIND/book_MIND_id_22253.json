    "word": "The tent was full to overflowing when I spoke on Sunday afternoon and a deep impression was made upon the people. From that meeting the interest has steadily increased. Captain Press and his wife, the president of the W.C.T.U. of Victoria, were present. Mrs. Press had visited me at my tent on the campground and she was urgent that I should speak to their society. After the discourse on Sunday she came to me \n\n\n                                     -283- \n\nand, grasping my hand, said, \"I thank you for that discourse. I see many new points which have made a lasting impression upon my mind. I shall never lose their force.\" I was introduced to her husband, a most noble looking man. He is a pilot and fills a very important position. Brother and Sister Starr took dinner with them and formed a very pleasant acquaintance. Mrs. Press, in behalf of the W.C.T.U., has made a very earnest request for instruction in hygienic cooking. We have arranged to have a cooking school, to be held in Melbourne in the room adjoining the hall of the W.C.T.U. Four lessons are to be given, one each week, beginning next Thursday. The cooking of eight different dishes is to be taught at each lesson. Great enthusiasm has been created on the subject. Mrs. Press is a vegetarian, not having tasted meat for four years.",
