    "word": "You, my brother, are in danger of carrying minds beyond their depth. Those who are best acquainted with Eld. P. have less confidence in him. They will take what he says, however untrue and unjust, and even ridiculous, and make it bear against the truth, if possible. But minds that will receive and be pleased with the productions of his pen are not the ones to be convinced of the truth, or that would honor the cause of God if they should accept the Sabbath. And you are in danger of presenting objections to thousands of minds that they never thought of, and which many will use if they become disaffected. If you and other men take a position to investigate and show the fallacy and inconsistency of men who dishonestly turn the truth of God into a lie, Satan will stir up men enough to keep your pen and the pens of several others constantly employed, while other branches of the work are left to suffer.",
