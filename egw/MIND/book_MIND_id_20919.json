    "word": "There is no time now to allow your children to follow baby or childish impulses. Educate them to self-control. One victory gained over yourself will be of great value and encouragement to your children. You may stand on vantage ground, saying, I am God's husbandry; I am God's building. I place myself under His hand to be fashioned after the divine similitude, that I may be a co-worker with God in fashioning the minds and characters of my \n\n\n                                    -95- \n\nchildren, so that it will be easier for them to walk in the way of the Lord. I will act my part faithfully, fitting them to become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. I must not place upon my children my defects of character. I must not complain of my children when with all my experience I do the very things for which I punish them. I must not allow a shade of darkness to come into their lives if I can possibly avoid it.",
