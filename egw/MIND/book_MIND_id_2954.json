    "word": "Chap. 57 - To Teachers and Students\n\n     We have been warned again and again that the character of the education that has been current in the world cannot stand the test of the word of God. The subject of education is one that should interest every Seventh-day Adventist. The Lord says to us, Seventh-day Adventists are not to place themselves under the counsel and instruction of teachers who know not the truth for this time. The molding and fashioning of minds should not be left to men who have not comprehended the importance of a preparation for that life which measures with the life of God.",
