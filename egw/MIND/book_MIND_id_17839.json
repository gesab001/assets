    "word": "The religion of the Bible is not detrimental to the health of the body or of the mind. The influence of the spirit of God is the very best medicine that can be received by a sick man or woman. Heaven is all health, and the more deeply the heavenly influences are realized, the more sure will be the recovery of the believing invalid. At some other Health Institutes they encourage amusements, plays, and dancing, to get up excitement, but are fearful as to the result of religious interest. Dr. Jackson's theory \n                                                                           20\nin this respect is not only erroneous, but dangerous. Yet he has talked this in such a manner that patients would be led, if his instructions were heeded, to think that their recovery depended upon their having as few thoughts of God and Heaven as possible. It is true that there are persons with ill-balanced minds, who imagine themselves to be very religious, who impose upon themselves fasting and prayer, to the injury of their health. These souls suffer themselves to be deceived. God has not required this of them. They have a pharisaical righteousness, which springs not from Christ, but from themselves. They trust to their own good works for salvation, and are seeking to buy Heaven by meritorious works of their own, instead of relying, as every sinner should, alone upon the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour. Christ and true godliness today, and forever, will be health to the body and strength to the soul.",
