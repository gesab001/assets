    "word": "Christ was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. To many it has been a mystery why so many sacrificial offerings were required in the old dispensation, why so many bleeding victims were led to the altar. But the great truth that was to be kept before men, and imprinted upon mind and heart, was this, \"Without shedding of blood is no remission.\" Hebrews 9:22. In every bleeding sacrifice was typified \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" John 1:29.",
