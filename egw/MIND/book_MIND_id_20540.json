    "word": "We see here in the sanitarium at Boulder that there is a necessity of each one standing in his lot and in his place. It would be wisdom to change the program, and often the one in service has complaints to make: he does not want to change. But while some serve all advantages, others see disadvantages in confining the mind to one class of studies. Some minds cannot endure the matter of one thing carried over for hours until the interest flags. Some minds are so constituted that they must have change in their studies. These students do not know what the matter is, but they are receiving brain damage. For some, the working forces need to be changed around to learn all jots and tittles of the work. Otherwise the work of the students will be most dry and monotonous, like the turning of a machine.",
