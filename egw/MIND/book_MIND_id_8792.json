    "word": "God is love. The love of the Father and the Son is an attribute of every believer. The Word of God is the channel through which divine love is communicated to man.

It transforms mind and character, enabling man to endure as seeing Him who is invisible. Perfect love can be enjoyed only through the belief of the truth and the reception of the Holy Spirit. . . .",
