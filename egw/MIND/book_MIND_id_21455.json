    "word": "There is little of the Holy Spirit in your councils. The men composing them do not feel that they must \"be still, and know that I am God.\" The work has been extended, and the churches need the riches of the grace of God, the sanctification of the Spirit of God, that the members, by a proper division of labor, may develop their capabilities in doing good. A more important matter than this cannot occupy the minds of the members of the General Conference in their deliberations.",
