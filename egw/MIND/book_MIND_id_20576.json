    "word": "You have many times escaped from the snare of the enemy, but you are not beyond the danger of making mistakes. You sometimes allow your mind to center upon a certain train of thought, and you are in danger of making a mountain out a molehill. Brother Prescott, there has been a serious weakness in your work of ministry. It is a tendency to sway from clearly defined truth and give undue attention to some items which seem to require hours of argument to prove, when in reality they do not need to be handled at all. It will be wise for you to say, when tempted to do this work, \"We cannot afford to arouse arguments upon points that are not essential for the salvation of the soul.\". . .",
