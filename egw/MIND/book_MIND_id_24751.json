    "word": "Of Daniel and his fellows the Scripture states: \"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in learning and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.\" In what manner are you fitting yourselves to cooperate with God. \"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you; resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\" Let the diet be carefully studied; it is not healthful. The various little dishes connected for desserts are injurious instead of helpful and healthful, and from the light given me there should be a decided change in the preparation of food. There should be a skillful, thorough cook, that will give ample supplies to the hungry students of substantial dishes. The education in this line of table supplies is \n\n\n                                 -73- \n\nnot correct or healthful and satisfying, and there is a decided reform essential. These students are God's inheritance, and the most sound and healthful principles are to be brought into the boarding school in regard to diet. The dishes of soft foods, the soups and liquid foods, or the free use of meat, are not the best to give healthful muscles, sound digestive organs, or clean brains. Oh, how slow we are to learn! And of all institutions in our world the school is the most important. Here the diet question is to be studied; no one person's appetite, or tastes, or fancy, or notion is to be followed, but there is need of great reform: for life-long injury will surely be the result of the present manner of cooking. Of all the positions of importance in that college is the one who is employed to direct the dishes to be prepared to place before the hungry students; for if this be neglected, the mind will not be prepared to do its work, because the stomach has been treated unwisely and can not do its work properly. Strong minds are needed. The human intellect must gain expansion and vigor and acuteness and activity. It must be taxed to do hard work, or it will become weak and inefficient. The brain power is required to think most earnestly: it must be put to the stretch to solve hard problems and master them, else the mind decreases in power and aptitude to think. The mind must invent work, and wrestle, in order to give hardness and vigor to the intellect; and, if the physical organs are not kept in the most healthful condition by substantial, nourishing food, the brain does not receive its portion of nutrition to work. Daniel understood this, and he brought himself to a plain, simple, nutritious diet, and refused the luxuries of the king's table. The desserts which take so much time to prepare are, many of them, detrimental to health. Solid foods requiring mastication will be far better than mush or liquid foods. I dwell upon this as essential. I send my warning to the College at Battle Creek, to go from there to all our institutions of learning. Study up on these subjects, and let the students obtain a proper education in the preparation of wholesome, appetizing, solid foods that nourish the system. They do not and have not had the right kind of training and education as to the most healthful food to make healthful sinews and muscle and give nourishment to the brain and nerve powers.",
