    "word": "My guide said, \"Elevate the standard in all school education. You must set up no lower standard. Discipline must be maintained. Teach the youth by precept and example.\" \n\n\n                     -2- \n\nThere has not been too much strictness, but too much laxness of action tolerated; but the workers must not despair. Work with the Spirit of Christ, with the mind of Christ, to correct existing evils. Expect that the wrong-doers will have the sympathy of wrong-doers; but faithful shepherds of the flock have lessons to learn in order to keep on an elevated standard and yet teach that the star of hope is still shining. Work on patiently; but rebuke sin firmly, and give it no sanction.",
