    "word": "Let not our young men be deterred from entering the ministry. There is danger that through glowing representations some will be drawn away from the path where God bids them walk. Some have been encouraged to take a course of study in medical lines who ought to be preparing themselves to enter the ministry. The Lord calls for more ministers to labor in His vineyard. The words were spoken, \"Strengthen the outposts; have faithful sentinels in every part of the world.\" God calls for you, young men. He calls for whole armies of young men who are large-hearted and large-minded, and who have a deep love for Christ and the truth.-- \"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. 6, p. 411. \n\n                                               -",
