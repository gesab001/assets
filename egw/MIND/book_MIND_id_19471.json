    "word": "The Lord has given to the school in Cooranbong the labors of Brother and Sister Haskell. They have been teaching His Word, and thus great light has been received. But in this work others must cooperate with them. The Lord does not design that one man's mind and one man's ideas and one man's presentation of the Word shall always control, even if the talents of others are not so valuable in the understanding of the Scriptures. He would have different minds mingle with the students. Men of a different mold should be given an opportunity to teach the Word in the school, to give to the students the impressions the Lord has given them. There is need of a union of different minds in the school, that the students may receive the strength of the varied talents. . . .",
