    "word": "MR No. 821 - Individuality in Educational Work\n\n     I am writing in Boulder Sanitarium and getting ready to start for Denver. I will present to you light given me and written directly after our [1901] General Conference in Battle Creek. The inquiry was made: Shall our nurses and helpers be set to pursue one line of work? Shall their whole study be to perfect themselves in that one line of work? I state here the light given me: Exigencies will oft require that there shall be a change from one line of work to another line of work, and it is important that the education given in all our institutions be one of diversity in unity. Not one is to be educated to pursue routine work in the sanitarium or in any of our institutions, so that hands and minds should be continually taxed with one long lesson of any order, because the mind needs to be worked on different lines of study which will not tax a certain class of organs too long at a time.",
