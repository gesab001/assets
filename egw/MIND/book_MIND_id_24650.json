She tells her son and daughter-in-law about one such occasion.\nDear Edson and Emma:\n     We were pleased, indeed, when the needs of the Huntsville School were presented at the Lodi campmeeting, to see the people take hold in earnest and give their pledges to the amount of $1,100. This was not the only call that was made for means at this meeting. A large number of our books and papers were taken by our people. The outlook for means was not very encouraging, we thought, at the beginning of the meeting. There was little appearance of wealth in the place. The homes of our people were small, one-story cottages. But the people had a mind to work, and money was raised for several lines of work.",
