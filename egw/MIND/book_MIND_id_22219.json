    "word": "We shall try to work hard here in this camp meeting, and shall not be able to do anything without the Lord's help. He will be with me. He will, I know that He will, for I make Him my only trust, and He will help me while I work in all humility of mind. I see the necessity of constant watchfulness and unceasing prayer. My heart is drawn out after God constantly. We can do great things in His strength. The Lord will help; the Lord will strengthen, and will bless. I hope you will see your way clearly and will be strong in God to battle against every wrong and stand free in God, in the power of His grace and lowliness and meekness. You can be a great blessing to His people when divested of self.",
