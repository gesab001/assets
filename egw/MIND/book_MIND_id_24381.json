    "word": "Christ, our divine Teacher, and the greatest Medical Missionary that ever trod this earth, came to our world at great sacrifice to show human beings that correct light in which to regard God. He has given His life as our example in all things. I have been instructed that those who in the daily life heed not the instructions of the Bible, do not know God or Christ whom He has sent. Those who have not lived the Scriptures will invent sophistries to occupy the mind and absorb the attention, and teach things that the One who owns man - body, soul, and spirit - has not said should be taught.",
