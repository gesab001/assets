    "word": "PH066 - Health, Philanthropic, and Medical Missionary Work (1896)\n\n\n       Relation of Health Institutions to the Cause. \n\n\n     My mind is much perplexed, my soul is burdened, because I discern many things which my brethren do not see in regard to the prosperity of our institutions. The medical branch of the work is the most difficult matter now before us. I have received letters from presidents of conferences and from men of property, and have also had interviews with these brethren, in reference to establishing health institutions in different States. I could not encourage this without a careful consideration of the wants of the cause of God in every branch. I have brought before their minds the difficulties that we have had to meet in the institutions already established, the discouragement which came in because there was such a lack of men of piety, of principle, of unswerving integrity, of well-balanced minds, of unselfish interests--men who were wholly consecrated to God. Men of this character are the only ones who should have a controlling power in our institutions.",
