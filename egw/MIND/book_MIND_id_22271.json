    "word": "And yet I would say to my brethren and sisters in Healdsburg, I believe the Spirit of God has done a work for you. Hold fast everything that is good. Have no spirit of Pharisaism, have no loftiness and self-confidence. The lower you lie at the foot of the cross, the more distinct and the more precious will be your views of Christ our Redeemer. The one grace that is so much wanted with everyone who professes to be a follower of Christ is meekness, humility, humbleness of mind. One view of Jesus sends self-importance to the winds.",
