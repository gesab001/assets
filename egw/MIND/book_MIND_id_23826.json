    "word": "Those who take part in God's work are to be led and guided by God. Every human ambition is to be submerged in Jesus Christ, who is head over all the institutions that God has established. He knows how to set in operation and keep in operation his own agencies. He knows that the cross must occupy the central place, because it is the means of man's atonement, and because of the influence it exerts on every part of the divine government. The Lord Jesus, who has been through all the history of our world understands the methods that should be invested with power over human minds. He knows the importance of every agency, and understands how the varied agencies should be related to one another.",
