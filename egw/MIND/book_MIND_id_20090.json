    "word": "My brother, do not try to reason in regard to the errors that the enemy presents. If you will receive the testimony of the Lord, reading His word \n\n\n                                    -345- \n\nwith a teachable heart, and refusing to put Scripture on the side of error to maintain falsehood, you will believe that I speak the truth, as a messenger of God. But if you allow the author of error to get between you and the Word, your mind will bear his impress.",
