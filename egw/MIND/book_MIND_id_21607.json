    "word": "The men who are standing in positions of responsibility are not to be lords. They are not to think that they can rule as kings. They are to be men of wisdom, able to give counsel that will protect and strengthen the people of God. They should carry out the instruction given in the eighteenth of Matthew. The men standing in positions of trust are to hate every vestige of selfishness. They are to show that they are not narrow-minded. They are to set an example that may be safely followed.",
