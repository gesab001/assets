In the words of the psalmist, God gave them \u201cof the corn of heaven. Man did eat angels\u2019 food\u201d (Psalm 78:24, 25)\u2014that is, food provided for them by the angels. Sustained by \u201cthe corn of heaven,\u201d they were daily taught that, having God\u2019s promise, they were as secure from want as if surrounded by fields of waving grain on the fertile plains of Canaan.\u2014Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 296, 297.",
