    "word": "I want that my brethren shall understand that the Lord is in earnest with them. I have not come to this place to cry in your ears, \"Peace, peace.\" It is because I have love for this cause, for my brethren, and for this church, that I \n\n\n                                 -94- \n\nseek to arouse your minds in regard to these things. Just as soon as we begin to accommodate the truth to our own circumstances and conveniences, then we begin to lessen the power of the truth and its influence: for just as surely this principle that has been weaving itself into this church will hinder it, just as others have been hindered. And when there is a departure from the strictest principles of truth then there is an inclination for a still wider departure.",
