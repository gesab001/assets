    "word": "Let us remember that it is not by word and precept alone that we are to reveal Christ's character. Our works must bear witness to His indwelling presence in the heart. His disposition, His kindness, His compassion, \n\n\n                                  -111- \n\nmanifested in our actions, will inspire hope in the minds and hearts of the most hopeless. Thus in act, as well as in word, we shall reveal to the world the character of the Unseen.--Manuscript 130, 1902. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Nov. 5, 1987. Entire Ms.",
