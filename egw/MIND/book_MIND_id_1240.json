    "word": "DREAM OF TEMPLE AND LAMB\n \n     While in this state of despondency, I had a dream that made a deep impression upon my mind. I\n25\ndreamed of seeing a temple, to which many persons were flocking. Only those who took refuge in that temple would be saved when time should close; all who remained outside would be forever lost. The multitudes without who were going about their various ways, derided and ridiculed those who were entering the temple, and told them that this plan of safety was a cunning deception, that in fact there was no danger whatever to avoid. They even laid hold of some to prevent them from hastening within the walls.",
