    "word": "The same afternoon an officer was sent to visit us, while some of our neighbors raised their windows to hear the result. Father was away to his work, and mother stepped to the door. He told her that complaints had reached him that we disturbed the peace of the neighborhood by noisy praying, and sometimes praying in the night, and he was requested to attend to the matter. Mother answered that we prayed morning and night, and sometimes at noon, and should continue to do so; that Daniel prayed to his God three times a day, notwithstanding the king's decree. He said that he had no objection to prayer, and if there was more of it in the neighborhood, it would make them better. \"But,\" said he, \"they complain of your praying in the night.\" He \n                                                                           81\nwas told that if any of the family were sick, or were in distress of mind in the night, it was our custom to call upon God for help, and we found relief. He was referred to our near neighbor who used strong drink. His voice was often heard cursing and blaspheming God. Why did not the neighbors send you to him, to still the disturbance he causes in the neighborhood? He serves his master, we serve the Lord our God. His curses and blasphemy seem not to disturb the neighbors while the voice of prayer greatly troubles them. \"Well,\" said the officer, \"what shall I tell them that you will do?\" My mother replied, \"Serve God, let the consequences be what they may.\" The officer left, and we had no further trouble from that quarter.",
