    "word": "\"I write from fifteen to twenty pages each day. It is now 11 o'clock and I have written fourteen pages of manuscript for Volume IV. . . . As I write upon my book I feel intensely moved. I want to get it out as soon as possible, for our people need it so much. I shall complete it next month if the Lord gives me health as He has done. I have been unable to sleep nights, for thinking of the important things to take place. Three hours and sometimes five is the most sleep I get. My mind is stirred so deeply I cannot rest. Write, write, write, I feel that I must and not delay.",
