    "word": "We are individually to be true and loyal to higher laws. Our Redeemer, who paid His life as a ransom for us, has said, \"If ye love Me, keep My commandments.\" The world around us sets its standard of customs and fashions to suit the inclination of unsanctified hearts; but they are not the rules for those who love Jesus Christ. Christ has chosen us out of the world, and has given us His own life to be our standard and our pattern. Everyone whom God loves will say, I must live in this world and yet not be of it. I must be as Christ has appointed. He says, \"Ye are the light of the world. . . . Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Keep the windows of the soul open toward heaven, and let the pure, holy atmosphere of heaven flow into the chambers of your mind and into the soul-temple. Then the windows that open earthward will close of themselves.",
