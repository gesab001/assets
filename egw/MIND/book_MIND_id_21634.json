    "word": "Here is presented the line of demarkation clear and distinct between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not. Will those who are associated together in our important institutions see the difference Christ has placed between the believers and unbelievers? Then let them not advocate by precept and example that the disobedient, unbelieving element possess so much of the grace of Christ that they will appreciate the spirit and the work of those who love God and keep His commandments. Christ says they will not know the truth, because they see not Christ and the Father. Satan is well pleased if he can so impose upon inexperienced minds that they shall believe that all is good of the disobedient, all is virtue and truth in the words of those who are of the world, agents of the wicked one, while they must regard with suspicion those who love God and keep His commandments, and believe all is bad of them which the disobedient may arraign and forge against them.",
