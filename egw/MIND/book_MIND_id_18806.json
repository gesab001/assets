    "word": "I was conducted to a few rooms from which came the voice of prayer. How welcome was the sound! A bright light shone upon the face of my guide as his hand traced every word of the petition. \"The Lord regardeth the righteous, and his ear is open unto their prayer.\" From still other rooms came the most disagreeable sallies of low wit, and vain talk. Some were making sport of individuals, and even imitating the words uttered in meeting; sacred things were made a subject of jest. Young men and young women were severely criticised; courtship and marriage were dwelt upon in a low, disgusting manner. There was scarcely a serious word spoken; the conversation was of a character to debase the mind and taint the morals; and all retired without committing themselves to God.",
