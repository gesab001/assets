    "word": "You need more of Jesus and less of self. Think no evil, talk no evil of anyone. Keep your lips as with a bridle. You cannot measure others' experiences by your own. It would be a deplorable thing if everyone were of the same mind. What if in some respects we do err, does the Lord forsake us, and forget us, and leave us to our own ways? No, the Lord does not treat us as we treat one another. May the Lord help you all to repent and confess, and let the love of Jesus pervade your hearts. Jealousy is all ready to spring into existence at the least provocation. Envy and evil surmising are ready to flourish, ready to grow by being cultivated. Oh, how \n\n\n                                   -264- \n\nmany hurt the heart of Christ because they want their own way and their own will. War against these unenviable traits of character, and not against one another.",
