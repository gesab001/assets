    "word": "The sentiment prevails in some minds that when colored people are given an education, they are spoiled for practical work. Of the education given in some schools, this may be true to a certain extent, but it will not be so in the schools where the Bible is made the foundation of all education, and where the students are taught to work in the fear and love of God, as their Master worked. It will not be so where students follow the example of the One who gave His life for the life of the world.",
