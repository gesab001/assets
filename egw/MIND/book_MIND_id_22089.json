    "word": "MR No. 1498 - State of the Work in Ohio; General Conference to Establish and Control Medical Institutions; Physicians to Be Models of Morality\n\n     (Written May 20, 1890, from St. Helena, California, addressee unknown.) \n\n     My mind is much perplexed, my soul weighed down with burdens, because I discern many things which my brethren do not see in regard to the prosperity of our institutions. The medical branch of the work is the most difficult matter now before us. I have received letters from presidents of conferences and from men of property, and have also had interviews with these brethren, in reference to establishing health institutions in different States. I could not encourage this without a careful consideration of the wants of the cause of God in every branch.",
