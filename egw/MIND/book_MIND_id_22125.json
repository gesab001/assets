    "word": "But the Lord is sorely displeased with the attitude of some in our churches. They reveal exactly the same spirit that the elder brother revealed because his father rejoiced over the returned prodigal. Will not the members of our churches remember that those who have had labor bestowed on them should have a knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent? If Christ is formed within, the hope of glory, they will seek to save those that are lost. A living church will not be a gossiping church, planting doubt, questioning, evil surmising, and jealousy in the hearts and minds of others. It will be an earnest, working church. The members will be the Lord's chosen vessels to carry the message of salvation to others. They will be His light bearers.",
