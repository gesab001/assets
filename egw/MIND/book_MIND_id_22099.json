    "word": "Elder Rice did not know how to manage. Dr. Maxson did not know how to meet and deal with human minds. He did not do what was needed to be done to win confidence. An institution for the sick should have ready for use all the appliances needed for the treatment of invalids, but if it is found to be too great a tax upon the finances of the institution to furnish all these things continually, you should say to the patients, We will allow you the use of these things for the present, but you had better get them for yourselves. We will not charge you for the present accommodation, \n\n\n                                     -394- \n\nbut it is not our practice to provide these things permanently.",
