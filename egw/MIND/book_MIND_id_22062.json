    "word": "Like the serpent gliding stealthily along, fanaticism has been stealing in to cause variance and strife, to take the attention of the people of God from elevating, eternal truth. I charge my brethren and sisters not to give heed to fables. Do not put into the minds of others the erroneous theories which should never be entertained. Teach what Christ taught. He said, \"Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:29). His lessons contain just what is needed in these last days. There is no need to bring in a mass of rubbish which in the end will be consumed. Let us not give to the world the impression that we are a body of fanatics.",
