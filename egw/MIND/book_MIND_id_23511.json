    "word": "Brother Eldridge, I have so longed to see you in a position where you would appreciate a living connection with God. I have longed to see my dear sister's son there also. I have prayed for you both with unutterable longings of soul in your behalf. But while thus praying for you, I heard the words, as if a voice were speaking to me, \"They can not see what you see. They do not estimate eternal things according to their rich value. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. You have communicated these things to them and to others. The articles in which you presented the truth that God had revealed to you have been placed in the hands of human agents to decide upon their character and value. This should not be done. Their minds and hearts must be refined, their perceptions spiritualized and ennobled, before they can appreciate the precious jewels of truth, or appreciate the work God has \n                                                                           1116\ngiven you. Your heart is sad and grieved, but no longer deceive yourself, or expect that men or women will value the light that God has given them from his own holiness, until they shall open their hearts to Jesus. \"Lean on me\", He says, \"trust in me; I will never fail you, I will be to you a present help in every time of need.\"",
