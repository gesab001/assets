D. Faulkhead.) \n\n     I am troubled in regard to you, for you are not walking in the light as the Lord permits it to shine upon your pathway. The Word of God is given as our guide, but you have not made that Word the book of your study. You have allowed other things to occupy your mind, and you have not disciplined yourself to search the Scriptures. Now, after being for years in the truth, you are ignorant of the very things you ought to know. You have not an experimental knowledge of God or of Jesus Christ, whom He hath sent.",
