    "word": "I saw that when sisters who are given to talk get together, Satan is generally present, for he finds employment. He stands by to excite the mind, and make the most of the advantage he has gained. He knows that all this gossip, and tale-bearing, and revealing of secrets, and dissecting character, separates the soul from God. It is death to spirituality and a calm religious influence. Sr. Lindsay sins in her words greatly. She ought in her words to have an influence for good. But this sad failing has been indulged in until she does not know what she is stating herself. She talks frequently at random, and does not always state things correctly. Sometimes her words put a different construction upon things than they will bear. Sometimes there is exaggeration. Then there is misstatement. There is not an intention to misstate, but the habit has been so long cherished of much talking, and upon things that are unprofitable, that she has become careless, and reckless in her words, destroys any influence \n                                                                           7\nshe might have for good. It is time there was an entire reform in this respect. Her society has not been prized as it would have been had this sinful talking been indulged in.",
