    "word": "True, honest work will give healthy action to the mind by giving healthy action to the muscles. It is the constant manufacturing of ills and burdens that kills.

We are called now to be educated, that we may do the work God has assigned to us, and it will not crush out our life. The humblest can work and have a share in the work, and a share in the reward when the coronation shall take place, and Christ, our Advocate and Redeemer, becomes the King of his redeemed subjects. \n\n\n                        - 31 -",
