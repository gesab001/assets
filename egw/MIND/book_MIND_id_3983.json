    "word": "Put On Gospel Shoes.--My brother, I have an intense desire that you shall be a man after God's heart. You must make a change in your life. You have most precious truth to present, but you must put on the gospel shoes--your feet must be \"shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.\" Your manner of addressing people is not always pleasing to God. You need to feel His converting power upon your soul every day. You are full of physical strength and energy, and you need much of the grace of Christ, that it may be said of you as it was of Him, \"Thy gentleness hath made me great.\" When the Holy Spirit takes possession of your mind and controls your strong feelings, you will be more Christlike.--Letter 164, 1902.",
