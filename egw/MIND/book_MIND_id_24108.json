    "word": "6. High Calling of Medical Missionaries \n\n\n     Christ came to this world as the great Medical Missionary. When His example is followed, medical missionary work will be carried forward on a much higher plane than it is at the present time. God calls for a reconversion among gospel teachers, and especially among physicians and other medical missionary workers, that Christ may not be misrepresented and put to shame. The cleansing must (610) begin in the heart and mind, and flow in the actions. The characters of our medical missionary workers need to be refined and ennobled. This result can be brought about only as these are made partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.-- Unpub. MS. (MS. 78'03)",
