    "word": "MR No. 559 - Overemphasis on English Grammar\n\n     Brother _____ could have done much better work for those that were to be ministers than he has done. God is not pleased that he has carried out his own plans, and led them after his own ideas. He has not always been patient, and encouraged men who have left their fields of labor at a sacrifice of time and expense to learn what they could in a short time. He has not adapted himself to the situation. He has mingled self in his work to a large extent. He might have done his part in sending forth these men with much greater knowledge, if he had not made grammar his idol, and kept the minds under his charge drilling upon grammar, when they should have been receiving a general education upon many subjects.",
