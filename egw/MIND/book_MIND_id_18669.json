    "word": "The worst of the matter is that you become impatient  if any effort is made to correct these evils. Your pride is touched, and when your brethren seek to counsel and help you, you regard them as personal enemies, and count their reproofs and corrections as designed to work evil against you. You are not right with God. It is only when one unduly esteems himself that he imagines evil of those who would help and save him. God has borne long with your perversity. For years \n\n\n                       [75] \n\nhe has sent you messages of warning; he has called to you, and held to you as a mother to her erring son; and yet his goodness and mercy have been abused. In the place of heeding the testimonies of the Spirit of God, you have treated them according to the frame of mind you were in when you received them; and your heart is hardened by the very goodness and mercy of God.",
