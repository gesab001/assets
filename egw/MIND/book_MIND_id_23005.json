    "word": "It was shown me that broader plans should be laid, but at the same time the work in each branch of the cause should be harmoniously united with that in every other branch, all making a perfect whole; but now, selfish ideas and principles are interwoven with the plans of the workers, which make the work defective. One man, who has the oversight of a certain line of work, magnifies his responsibilities until his one branch, in his mind, is above every other branch, when in reality all are equally important. When this narrow, selfish idea is received, all his energies are set to imbue the people with the same idea. This is human nature, but not after Christ's order. Just in proportion as this policy is followed, Christ is pushed aside, and self appears prominent. When the Saviour is allowed his part in the work, none will become entirely absorbed in any one branch of it, but all will have broad ideas, and will attribute to all parts of the work their due importance.",
