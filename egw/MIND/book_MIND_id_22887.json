May the Lord give me much of His Holy Spirit; for of myself I can not do the work that God has committed to me. And unless God shall influence the minds of Dr. Kellogg and his associates, they will surely say, \"Who has been talking with Sister White?\" My answer is, \"One who is in authority\". But the question, \"Who has been talking with Sister White?\" by whomsoever asked, shows a lack of confidence in the work that the Lord has given me to do. It shows that this work is not appreciated.",
