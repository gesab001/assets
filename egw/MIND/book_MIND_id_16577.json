    "word": "What means this deadness? What means this spirit of being self-centered? Time is passing! The end is near! Whom are you trying to save from the pit of destruction? O that God would breathe in these worldly-minded souls; O that they might feel to the very depths of their being that they must watch unto prayer, that they have entrusted talents to be used now, just now, whenever God calls for their gifts to advance His work in our world. Do they hear the voice of God saying, \"Ye are the light of the world\"? Imaginations and dreams and a knowledge of the truth are not enough. Every believer is to kindle his taper from the divine altar. All are to shine, because the light of the truth has come upon them, and they cannot help shining amid the moral darkness of the world. . . .",
