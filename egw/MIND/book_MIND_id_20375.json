    "word": "When the lawyer came to Christ and asked, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" the answer was, \"Keep the commandments.\" Here a positive question is asked by the lawyer, and he receives an answer just as positive. \n\n\n                                 -263- \n\nYou must give your powers to God. \"Well,\" said a doctor who was trying to bring my mind down to earth, \"you will be unfitted for this earth if you try to put all your strength into the service of God.\" \"Is that so, Doctor? Since I was 17 I have been traveling east and west and north and south, and have seen hundreds converted, and does this unfit me for a connection with the earth? When we have a right hold upon heaven we shall represent the love of Christ to the perishing sinner.\" The doctor said, \"It is those who are in the dance hall that have called for Mrs. White to come and pray for them.\" They don't call for those who are pleasure lovers, but for those who know what it is to offer up their prayers in faith to God. And when we have an intelligent knowledge of Jesus Christ and His religion, then it is that we can be a blessing to those around us.",
