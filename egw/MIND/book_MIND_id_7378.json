    "word": "If the minds of our youth, as well as those of more mature age, were directed aright when associated together, their conversation would be upon exalted themes. When the mind is pure, and the thoughts elevated by the truth of God, the words will be of the same character, \"like apples of gold in pictures of silver.\" But with the present understanding, with the present practices, with the low standard which even professed Christians are content to reach, the conversation is cheap and profitless. It is \"of the earth, earthy,\" and savors not of the truth, or of heaven, and does not come up even to the standard of the more cultured class of worldlings.",
