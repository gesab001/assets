    "word": "I am instructed that one place which will be classed with those \n\n72. \n\nwhere many mighty works have been done, and where the people have turned from light and evidence, is Battle Creek. Battle Creek has been the seat of rebellion among a people to whom the Lord has given great light and special opportunities. But the light has been discarded for the privilege of pleasing self, and of following the unsanctified will. Minds and characters that might have been moulded and fashioned after the divine similitude, have been marred and stunted by self-serving. The opportunities that God has given whereby men might secure His help and favor have been neglected.",
