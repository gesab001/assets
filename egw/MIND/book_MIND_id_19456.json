If the Word is studied with humility of mind, the Holy Spirit will make its application. \"The entrance of Thy words giveth light,\" says the psalmist. \"It giveth understanding unto the simple.\" It sends forth to all who study its divine principles precious beams of light. It is better than any drugs, and will give physical soundness.--Ms 53, 1898. \n\n\n                                     -368-",
