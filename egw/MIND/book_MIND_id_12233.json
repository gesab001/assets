    "word": "I saw that those who move West should be like men waiting for their Lord. \"Be a living example,\" said the angel, \"to those in the West. Let your works show that you are God's peculiar people, and that you have a peculiar work, the last message of mercy to the world. Let your works show to those around you that this world is not your home.\" I saw that those who have entangled themselves should go free, break the snare of the Enemy. Lay not up treasure upon earth, but show by your lives that you are laying up treasure in heaven. If God has called thee West, he has a work for thee to do, an exalted work. \n                                                                           214\nLet your faith and experience help those who have not a living experience. Let not the attraction be to this poor, dark world, but let it be upward to God, glory and heaven. Let not the care and perplexity of farms here engross the mind, but contemplate Abraham's farm. We are heirs to that immortal inheritance. Wean your affections from earth, and dwell upon heavenly things.",
