    "word": "A real converting, reformatory change should now take place. Every one who fears God should search the Scriptures, and carry with him into his day's work a sense of his privileges under a Ruler who understands the purity of his motives. Minds must not be diverted from God to man. We must not fear the fear of the wicked, and allow our consciences to be manipulated by men. Satan has been bearing rule in many minds. He will work through (575) those who can be easily exalted and led to exercise their capabilities to repress or exalt others. The time has come when we must keep firm hold of the strong arm of Jehovah; for every species of delusion is being exercised. The prince of darkness is working through the minds of men who, in their lack of spiritual discernment, suppose that they are to rule the experience of the Lord's little children, who are to look to God in a living, simple working faith.",
