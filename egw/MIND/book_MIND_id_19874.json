But you are far from being a safe and successful worker in doing this. Your mind is not always in such a condition that you can safely follow its leadings. Frequently things come into your mind which you regard as the special teachings of the Spirit of God, impressions direct from the Lord; but they are not. You cannot rely upon these impressions.

The light given of God was rejected because it did not coincide with these impressions and sustain the intense feelings he had upon many points.",
