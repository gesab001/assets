    "word": "30. Ellen White's Assistants \n\n     To W. F. C., September 6, 1895. [BOTH BROTHER W. F. C. AND FANNIE Y WERE EMPLOYEES OF ELLEN WHITE, FIRST AT MELBOURNE, AND LATER AT COORANBONG, NEW SOUTH WALES. IN 1895 MRS. WHITE AND HER STAFF WERE LIVING AND WORKING IN TENTS WHILE SUNNYSIDE, THE PERMANENT RESIDENCE, WAS BEING BUILT.] This morning as I came from the school ground I saw your horse fastened to a tree before the tent occupied by Fannie Y. After a while I went to the tent. A lady from Newcastle and Jessie Israel were visiting Fannie. You were sitting down, writing on the typewriter. Why did you not take the typewriter at once into the dining tent? What impression can such a course make \n                                                                           207\nupon the mind of the young girl visiting at the school? It made an impression that was anything but favorable.",
