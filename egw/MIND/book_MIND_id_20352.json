    "word": "Sister White: I have not been able to get from Willie full particulars regarding perplexing matters. He is careful to tell me only of victories gained, or anything that will encourage me. When he attends meetings, he does not make it a point to tell me of the difficulties that he encounters in these meetings. Instead of going into particulars regarding the matters that perplex the brethren, he presents those things that he thinks will not disturb my mind. Sometimes letters come, giving me information that I should never gain from him, because he won't tell me.--Manuscript 109, 1907, pp. 4,5. (\"The Management of Conference Affairs,\" Interview, October 6, 1907.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. April 2, 1979",
