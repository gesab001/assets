    "word": "I have also been pronounced a deceiver because I have said, \"The Lord will soon come; get ready, get ready that ye may be found waiting, watching and loving His appearing.\" But in the Revelation I read this statement, \n\n\n                                     -271- \n\n\"Behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be\" (Revelation 22:12). \"Behold, I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book\" (Revelation 22:7). \"Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown\" (Revelation 3:11). Was the One who bore this testimony a deceiver, because the \"quickly\" has been protracted longer than our finite minds could anticipate? It is the faithful and true witness that speaks. His words are verity and truth.",
