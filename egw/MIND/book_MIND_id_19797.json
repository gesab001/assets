    "word": "Heaven, I long for heaven; Christ is the center of attraction. Our future state is a continuation of our work in coming to God in probationary time. Heaven is the ceaseless approaching to God through Jesus Christ. The longer we are in the heaven of bliss, the more and still more of glory will be opened to us; and the more we know of God, the more intense will be our happiness. The eternal weight of glory is not taken in all at once, but it pours its tide, wave after wave, of glory into the mind and heart. When Christ said, Come unto me, he means us to walk with him in this life, and be filled with love, satisfied with his presence in this world. All that human nature can bear, we may receive here. But what is this compared with the hereafter. \"Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\"--Ms 14, 1895, pp. 1, 2.
