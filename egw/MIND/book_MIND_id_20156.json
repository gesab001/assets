    "word": "Brother _____ has not taken in the situation. Men come to mature years, even the meridian of life, having families of their own, and have become embarrassed unnecessarily. They have sometimes been placed in the most embarrassing positions. Brother _____ has been exceedingly sensitive himself, if his dignity was not respected, if he imagined that he was in thought or look or word ridiculed. He has not reasoned that there were minds just as sensitive as his own to sarcasm or ridicule and censure. In this he has wounded his brethren and displeased God. Brother _____ is naturally severe, critical, and exacting, and he will have to be guarded on this point constantly, with the elder as well as the younger.",
