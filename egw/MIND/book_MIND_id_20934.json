    "word": "In the school our sisters were surrounded by active, inquiring minds, quick to discern and to draw conclusions. The state of the mind is easily read, as revealed in little actions, in a word which is a seed dropped now and then. It is manifest whether or not one is on the side of order and obedience to rules and regulations. Unless these rules are respected and obeyed, the school would speedily become demoralized. When those who carried the burden of responsibility feel the necessity of requiring correct deportment, respect, and obedience, it is a sad thing that Sister_____ should be on the wrong side, feeling that those who disregard the rules should be treated in such a way that the rules would mean nothing to them. Sister_____does not regard her words and attitude thus, but thus God regards them.",
