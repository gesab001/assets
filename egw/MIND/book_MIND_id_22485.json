    "word": "I have now spoken four times in the morning and business meetings and for one hour last evening to the canvassing class. This morning Brother Chadwick leaves us and returns to Battle Creek. He is in danger, through the prevailing influences which exist there, of becoming unbalanced in mind. Willie leaves later in the week for Battle Creek. Sara and I shall attend meetings at Norwich, Conn., and at Danvers, [Mass.]. Brother Asa Robinson will be in attendance at these meetings. We wish that Willie could be with us also, but it seems to be necessary for him to go to Battle Creek at this time to attend to important matters. I ought to have him with me in my work, but if the presence of the Lord goes with us, we shall have profitable and successful meetings.",
