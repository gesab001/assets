    "word": "All can communicate, if they will, the grand yet simple truths regarding the mission and work of Christ. If they seek the Lord daily in earnest prayer, they will understand how to meet the people as Christ met them, adapting the instruction to their varied circumstances and understanding. The spiritual lessons regarding the kingdom of God, they should illustrate by the natural things with which their hearers are familiar. Then, as these natural objects are seen, day by day, the lesson of truth will be repeated to the mind.--RH Oct. 4, 1898.",
