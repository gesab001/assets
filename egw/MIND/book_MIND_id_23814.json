    "word": "The wrong course that men propose to pursue will not appear as evil until it has taken firm hold of the mind and is acted out and has grown to large proportions, in controlling everything possible, or crushing that which will not be controlled. The very first stone laid to build the human structure after men's devising was wrong. Ungodliness will be practiced in many lines and God will be greatly dishonored. Men will lift up themselves proudly and as they act toward others God will act toward them. By their fruits that they bear in practicing their works ye shall know them.",
