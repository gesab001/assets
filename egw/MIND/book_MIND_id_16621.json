    "word": "Christ calls for the greatest of all gifts--the gift of the heart, the mind, the soul, the strength. . . . God requires the service of the whole heart. Those who place themselves in right relation to God will stand the test of the judgment. If the heart, mind, soul, and strength are looked upon as the Lord's blood-bought heritage, He will use them in His service. Those who obtain eternal life must give evidence to the world that they love God with all the capabilities that He has given them. They are to obey the two supreme commands, which embody all the whole law, acknowledging by their course of action that they are doers of the law. . . .",
