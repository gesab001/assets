    "word": "The word of God is to be the foundation of all study, and the words of revelation, carefully studied, appeal to and strengthen the intellect as well as the heart. The culture of the intellect is required, that we may understand the revelation of the will of God to us. It cannot be neglected by those who are obedient to his commandment. God has not given us the faculties of the mind to be devoted to cheap and frivolous pursuits.",
