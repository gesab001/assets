    "word": "The entrance of God's Word gives understanding to the simple-- those who are untaught in the wisdom of the world. The Holy Spirit brings the saving truths of the Scriptures within the comprehension of all who desire to know and do the will of God. Uneducated minds are enabled to grasp the most sublime and soul-stirring themes that can engage the attention of men--themes that will be the study and the song of the redeemed through all eternity.",
