    "word": "What we need is, not to boast of our smartness; for this is what keeps us from humbling the heart before God, and seeking Him as little children. It is this that brings us into a position where we cannot put ourselves under God and in subjection to His laws. May God help us that we may have a conversion every day of our lives. Those who do this will find that the intellect is strengthened by Him who created it. The mind will grow in the right channel, and will be fitting up for heaven. God is trying you now, here, to see how much you think of Him; to see how much you think of His government; to see how much you think of His purposes. God is trying you to see how much you think of the sacrifices He has made in order that souls might be won to Jesus Christ and placed under His blood-stained banner.",
