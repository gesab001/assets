    "word": "Last night I had a wonderful experience. I was [in the visions of the night] in an assembly where questions were being asked and answered. I awoke at one o'clock and arose. For a time I walked the room, praying most earnestly for clearness of mind, for strength of eyesight, and for strength to write the things that must be written. I entreated the Lord to help me to bear a testimony that would awake His people before it is forever too late. I was glad that there was no one in the room below me. Sara [McEnterfer] and Maggie [Hare] usually occupy this room, but during the summer they sleep in a tent pitched under a great live-oak tree growing close by the house. . . .",
