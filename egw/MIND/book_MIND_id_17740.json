    "word": "Students may receive their diplomas, and yet their education has but just commenced. But generally the student who knows nothing of what it is to bear responsibility anywhere, that has not taken the burden of thinking, the burden of care-taking, of studying complicated cases, feels that he is a ripe scholar. It is because they know so little that they think they know so much. If they knew considerable more they would sense their inability. The one who best knows himself will work in all humility. He feels like making no proud boasts; he bears a weight of responsibility as he sees the woes of suffering humanity, and he will not take human life into his hands to deal with even the bodies of men, without connecting with the experienced physician, regarding him as a father and himself as a child to be instructed and nourished and corrected, if in error. This is the way our medical students should regard Dr. Kellogg. They should work up an experience beginning at the lower round of the ladder, and by careful, earnest, thoughtful exertion, climb round after round, religion, Bible religion, being the mainspring of action. They cannot expect to be ranked by the side of \n\n\n                         -12- \n\nDr. Kellogg who has devoted his time, his energies and soul to the work for years, unless they shall give evidence of capabilities of mind, and intelligence in practice.",
