    "word": "I was pointed back and saw that in every important move, every decision made, or point gained, by God's people, there have been those who have arisen to carry matters to extremes, and to move in an extravagant manner, which has disgusted unbelievers and distressed God's people, and brought the cause of God into disrepute. The people whom God is leading out in these last days, will be troubled with just such things. But much evil will be avoided if the ministers of Christ will be of one mind, unite in effort, unite in their plans of action, sustain each other, stand together, and be faithful to reprove and rebuke wrong, which will soon cause it to wither. But Satan has controlled these matters very much. Private \n                                                                           47\nmembers, and even preachers, have sympathized with disaffected ones who have been reproved for their wrongs, and division of feeling has been the result. The one who has ventured out and faithfully met error and wrong, and discharged his disagreeable duty, is grieved and wounded that he receives not the fullest sympathy of his preaching brethren. He becomes discouraged in discharging such painful duties, lays down the cross and withholds the pointed testimony. His soul is shut up in darkness, and the church suffer for the lack of the very testimony God designed should live in the church. Satan's object is gained when the faithful testimony is suppressed. Those who so readily sympathize with the wrong, consider it a virtue, but they realize not that they are exerting a scattering influence, and that they themselves help to carry out Satan's plans.",
