    "word": "The Lord says, \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.\" The advice of your own brethren may cause you to swerve from the path which the Lord has marked out for you to walk in; for the minds of men are not always under the control of the Holy Spirit. \"Watch\" lest your studies shall accumulate to such proportions, and become of such absorbing interest to you, that your mind shall become overburdened, and the desire for godliness be crushed out of your soul. With many students the motive and aim which caused them to enter school have gradually been lost sight of, and an unholy ambition to secure a high-class education has led them to sacrifice the truth. Their intense interest to secure a high place among men has caused them to leave the will of their Heavenly Father out of their calculations; but true knowledge leads to holiness of life through the sanctification of the truth.",
