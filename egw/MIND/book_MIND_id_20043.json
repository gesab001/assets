    "word": "Women will not choose the society of one man above another unless they are better pleased with his habits and principles. If the society of a man of impure mind and licentious habits is chosen in preference to that of the virtuous and pure, there can be no surer indication that the inclinations and tastes harmonize. This level is called by these deceived, blinded, infatuated souls, a high and holy affinity of spirit, a spiritual harmony. The apostle terms this as \"spiritual wickedness in high places,\" against which we are to institute a vigorous warfare whenever it may be discovered. Give it no quarters. It is the tracks of the old serpent, whose sting is death. It ruins the body. Its influence is fatal upon the soul. . . .",
