    "word": "MR No. 496 - Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself\n\n     You must stop and rest and be happy and not worry your mind about the responsibilities of the work and cause of God. Be peaceful, calm and happy and trust yourself in the work and cause of God, feeling that you are now to soften, sweeten, ripen up for heaven. God loves you. But you will with your advanced age, and your strong peculiarities certainly mar the work of God more than you can help it.--Letter 2, 1872, p. 1. (To Brother Bates, February 12, 1872.)",
