    "word": "Since the General Conference of 1901, I have carried a very heavy burden. Before I went to the Conference, light was given me that we must do all that we could to help Dr. Kellogg. The Lord said, \"He is My physician, But he is himself in need of healing. He has taken upon himself responsibilities that I have not given him.\" He was to be given another opportunity to establish his faith in the testimonies that for nearly half a century the Lord has been sending His people. Had he at that Conference fallen on the Rock, and been broken, had he come to God in humiliation and contrition, he would have received great light. But he allowed ambitious plans to occupy his mind. He has not taken time to study the Scriptures diligently, and he has not a true understanding of the work for these last days. He has not cherished a true, genuine faith,--a faith that would qualify him for the work of God. He has been in a dangerous position. Unless he places himself where he can be worked by the Holy Spirit, he will weave into his talks to the students that which is not true. He has planned to do a great work. But the Lord forbids us, as His appointed watchmen, stewards of His grace and shepherds of His flock, to allow him any longer to carry on the work in his own ambitious way. Instead of feeling that it is his work to speak and write about God as he has done, he should go apart for a time, and diligently study the Scriptures.",
