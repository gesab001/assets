    "word": "One thing I am determined upon, that Willie's life shall not be as it has been. God will have it otherwise. I write because it is time I should write, and because I must do all I can to change an order of things that has not been wise, and in accordance with the mind and will of God. It bears not His superscription. We will work in God's lines, and will be in harmony with my brethren, if they will be on the right side, in harmony with God's mind and God's will; but we will honor those whom God honors, irrespective of their position or talents.",
