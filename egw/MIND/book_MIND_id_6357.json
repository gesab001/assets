    "word": "\u201cI saw that those who profess the truth should hold the standard high, and induce others to come up to it. I saw that some would have to walk the straight path alone. Their companions and children will not walk the self-denying pathway with them. Patience and forbearance should ever characterize the lives of those lone pilgrims, following the example of their blessed Master. They will have many trials to endure, but they have that hope that makes the soul strong, bears them up above the trials of earth, and elevates them above scorn, derision, and reproach. Those who possess a hope like this should never indulge a harsh, unkind \n335\nspirit. This will only injure their souls, and drive their friends farther from the truth. Treat them tenderly; give them no occasion to reproach the cause of Christ; but never yield the truth to please any one. Be decided, be fixed, be established, be not of a doubtful mind.",
