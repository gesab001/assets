    "word": "Where is the gratitude that should rise from human lips for His preserving care? Where is the recognition of His unceasing watchfulness? Why does not thankfulness flow forth from the life in gratitude-offerings? Why do not springs of joy well up in the heart? Why are there not made pledges of most sacred consecration to do the will and way of the Lord? Where are the sensible thoughts that should fill each mind? Thorough conversion from selfishness should now be seen. We should put away all the plans which do not directly tend to advance the Lord's plans, and which, if carried out, would retard the work that should be done for perishing souls.",
