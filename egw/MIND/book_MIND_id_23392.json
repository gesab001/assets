    "word": "Now in reference to your question in regard to Sister Marks. Do not be in a hurry to accede to her request in dropping her name. Hold a little in the matter. It cannot do the church any particular damage. Meanwhile I am more than ever convinced that if this work now going forward in Battle Creek had been done one year ago, Sister Marks would have been saved to the cause of God, and would, with proper instruction, have been a good Christian worker. This \n                                                                           853\nis due to her. But the position that many held me in was such that I could do nothing unless I took my stand decidedly against the Battle Creek church. Had those with whom she held meetings been well balanced in mind, they could have helped her instead of being moulded by Sister Marks. I believe she had a genuine experience and might have done much good. She had newly come into the faith, and needed to be led along step by step, kindly, compassionately, but as it was the fashion to turn from everything that was calculated to restore and to awaken the church as my testimony was [regarded] at that time below par, what could I do? Any move I should make would, if unwise, indiscreet ones should go to extremes, be charged to me, and my work forever discarded. Do all you can for Mrs. Marks, for I tell you, the blood of her soul, I fear, will rest upon those who have been blinded by the enemy and done those things that have grieved the Spirit of the Lord.",
