    "word": "I am instructed of the Lord that ministers, colored laborers, often are in need of Bible education, to be kind in their own family, and never to practice slavery customs used by slavery masters in harsh speech and their own disorderly habits. Do your best to expect you are to change your own ideas, colored fathers and mothers, if you expect the white to treat you with compassion and sympathy and affection. Put away, ministering colored brethren who have wife and children, your harsh, authoritative practices, for the Lord will not accept your work; but consider \u201cI am now a member of the Lord\u2019s family and I am to sample His family in this world in having my lips [and] manners sanctified, my speech without passion. I am not authorized to be a tyrant because I have witnessed so much tyranny in those masters who have considered the slaves were [their] own flesh, heart, mind, soul and body, when God is their Owner.\u201d",
