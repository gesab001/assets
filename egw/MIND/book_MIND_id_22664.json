    "word": "My Father, my Father, for Christ's sake, let Thy Spirit impress the minds of those who are in this house, and may they clear the King's highway, and prepare the way for Thee to come to work with human minds. Help them to remove the stumbling-blocks out of the way, and to take themselves out of the way. They are standing directly in Thy way; and oh, impress their hearts so fully, so sensibly, that they will repent, repent, repent, and be converted, before it shall be everlastingly too late!",
