    "word": "I so much wish that every person who is engaged with me in the important work I am doing would have this precious transforming grace of Jesus Christ. Then there would be the blessed enlightenment from the face of Jesus Christ that would represent an indwelling Jesus. Oh, how much more we might enjoy of the Spirit and power of God if we would only surrender mind, heart, soul, and strength wholly and unreservedly to the quickening influence of the Holy Spirit of God! The work would then receive the divine mold. The power of God would rest upon the worker. I pray for every soul connected with me in the work.",
