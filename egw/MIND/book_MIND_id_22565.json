My mind is traveling. Things are constantly being revived to my mind that have been revealed in times past, all the way along. I feel such a burden pressing and urging upon me that I cannot keep my tongue silent. Now, we have talked it, and we have urged it, and we have set it before you, and begged and pleaded and prayed and wrestled with all the strength of our being, until we have felt afterward--after the occasion was over--the whole being was so feeble that my breath might stop and my life end at any time. Still on another occasion I am urged in behalf of the people. Now, why can't you do some of this? Every time our people assemble, they come, and they hear, and they go away as they came. They may have a little light, but they do not act on it. They do not take their position on the Lord's side. You do not see that they have opened up the avenues of the heart where the Spirit of God, with its illuminating power, can come right into the heart and soul, so that they will respond.",
