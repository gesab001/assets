    "word": "I write to you, my brother, that the giving of prescriptions for the \n\n                                   - 33 - \n\neating of flesh of animals may no more be practiced in our sanitariums. There is no excuse for this. There is no safety in the after influence and results upon the human mind. Let us make known in our institutions that there is no longer a meat table, even for the boarders, and then the education given upon the discarding of a meat diet, will not only be saying, but doing. If patronage is less, so let it be. The principles will be of far greater value when they are understood, when it is known that the life of no living thing shall be taken to sustain the life of a Christian.",
