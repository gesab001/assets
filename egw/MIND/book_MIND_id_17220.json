    "word": "Preach the Word. \n\n     Those who claim to preach the word should preach the word, ever remembering that they are laborers together with God. He is their efficiency, and if he is given opportunity, he will work for them. If they are humble, if they do not rely upon their own supposed wisdom and ability, God will place arguments in their mind, and speak through their lips. He will also impress the minds of the hearers, preparing their hearts to receive the seed which is sown.",
