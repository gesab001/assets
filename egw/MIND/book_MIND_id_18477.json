    "word": "If Battle Creek does not arouse now and go to work in missionary fields, they will fall back into death-like slumber. How did the Holy Spirit work upon your hearts? By the energies of the Holy Spirit it was stimulating you to exercise the talents God has given you, that every man and woman and youth should employ them to set forth the truth for this time, making personal efforts, going into the cities where truth has never been and lifting the standard. Have not your energies been quickened in the blessing God has bestowed upon you, and the truth been more deeply impressed upon your soul, and its relative importance to perishing souls out of Christ? Are ye witnesses for Christ in a more distinct and decided manner, after the manifest revealing of God's blessing upon you? The Holy Spirit's office is to bring decidedly to your minds the important, vital truths. Is this to be bound up in a napkin and hidden in the earth?--No, no, it is to be put out to the exchangers; and as man uses his talents, however small, the Holy Spirit takes the things of God, and presents them anew to the mind. He makes the neglected word to be a vivifying agency through the Spirit; it is quick and powerful upon human minds, not because of the smartness, the educational power of the human agency, but because the divine power works with the human; and it is the divine that deserves all the credit. \n\n\n                      -13-",
