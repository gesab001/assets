    "word": "Letter 39, 1895, pp. 1, 10. (To Dr. Kellogg, February 3, 1895.) --I have received your letter in which you asked a question in reference to the publication of a new edition of Christian Temperance. It is my mind as well as yours that another edition is needed, and as Fannie has the papers supplied far ahead, I shall set her to work at once selecting matter and arranging for this new edition. . . . You proposed to send me a \"paste up\" of matter to indicate what you would consider appropriate for the book you mentioned. This would please me very much, and I hope you will do it as soon as possible. Meanwhile, after supplying the papers, Fannie will do something in this line.",
