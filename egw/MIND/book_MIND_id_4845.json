    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     Why is it that some of our ministers have so little power?\u2014Because they have not made an entire surrender to God. They do not see the sinfulness of clinging to their own way. While they hold the truth, and try to present it to others, they cling tenaciously to their own ideas, which are crude and narrow and without symmetry; and in the minds of the \n245\npeople the precious truth of God is blended with the peculiarities of the minister, and is refused. Let all who preach the truth, and all who profess to believe it, submit themselves fully to the influence of the Spirit of God, that the truth may refine, elevate, and sanctify them.",
