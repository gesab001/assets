    "word": "Elder Van Horn, you need the quickening influence of the Spirit of God. You need the life-giving power from on high. You have set discourses which you have given the people for years; if these could, to a great extent, be banished from your mind, and you come to the school of Christ to learn of him as a little child, O, what light, what power, what love, what grace and joy, would flood your soul; but you have not seen your need, you have not felt your want, and your labors have not been, could not be, as God would have them, full of marrow and fatness. God has offered you fresh manna for the people, but you \n                                                                           1140\nyourself have eaten only what you chose to eat, and have given the same to the people. They have not, as a general thing, had the education and instruction it was their right to have for the present time.",
