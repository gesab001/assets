    "word": "The law of God requires that we love one another as we love ourselves. Then every power and action of the mind must be put forth to that end\u2014to do the greatest amount of good. . . . How pleasing to the Giver for us to hold the royal gifts of the soul so that they shall tell with power upon others! They are the connecting link between God and humans, and reveal the Spirit of Christ and the attributes of heaven. The power of holiness, seen but not boasted of, speaks more eloquently than the most able sermons. It speaks of God and opens to men and women their duty more powerfully than mere words can do.\u2014Letter 39, 1887 (Manuscript Releases, vol. 20, pp. 137, 138).",
