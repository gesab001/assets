    "word": "Only Through Harmonious Development Can Perfection Be Attained.--The improvement of the mind is a duty which we owe to ourselves, to society, and to God.

And it is only by the harmonious development of both the mental and the moral faculties that the highest perfection of either can be attained.--CT 541 (1913).",
