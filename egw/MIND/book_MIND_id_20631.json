    "word": "The Danger of Presenting to Students Things That Make God's Word of None Effect--Those who present the truth should be men of solid minds, who will not lead their hearers into a field of thistles, as it were, and there leave them. What is the chaff to the wheat? There are those teaching others who need that one teach them how to labor for the present and eternal good of those they instruct. Some readily catch up trivial theories, calling them truth, and neglecting for them the immortal principles which must be interwoven with the life-experience of him who is saved. They are ready to open the mind to any fallacy that is presented. These are in danger of bringing in vain things which make of none effect the important truths of God's Word. This Word is the Lord's revealed will, given for the instruction of His people. Let no one bring dishonor to the precious truth by mingling with it theories which have no foundation in the Word of God.--Ms. 70, 1901, pp. 8, 9. (\"What Is the Chaff to the Wheat?\" July 20, 1901.)",
