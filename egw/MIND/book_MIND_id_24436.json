    "word": "George's Terrace, St. Kilda Road \n                                        Melbourne, January 9, 1893 \n\n\n     This afternoon I had a long conversation with Brother Foster a member of the Prahran Church, who is in perplexity and trial. He is a tailor by trade, and is a first class workman. Before accepting the truth he had a position that commanded $30.00 a week. When he began to keep the Sabbath, he was permitted to retain his position, losing only the day's wages for the Sabbath. He is a man of good address, and has good ability to teach the truth. He left his position, and went into the field as a laborer, but was sent alone into a hard field, and became discouraged and confused, and almost fell under the delusive power of Satan. At the conference one year ago he had a conversation with me. He became free, the meeting did him good. He has since moved to Melbourne, and works at his trade and leads the meetings in Prahran. But in the present depression of business, he is in close circumstances; and being in poor health, with a large family, he has become much discouraged, and in this state of mind Satan has pressed temptation and darkness upon him. For weeks he has been in sore trial, and today he came to tell me his troubles.",
