    "word": "This chapter [John 15] is very simple in its illustrations, and every one should seek to understand its lessons. They should bear in mind that the branches in the true Vine are the believers who are brought into oneness by being connected with the Vine stock. There must be unity in their diversity. Individuality is preserved; for one branch cannot blend into another in the same stock; yet every individual branch must be in fellowship with the other if they are united to the parent stock.",
