(To Bro. and Sr. Corliss, April 6, 1896.)--The very first time I spoke, on Friday morning, I had a very great burden to address Caldwell and set his position before him; then after meeting I read to him some things concerning himself and Fannie. She is now in my home in a very feeble nervous condition. I am astonished how Satan can work upon human minds and warp the character if any human being will give him a chance. How this case will terminate I know not. \n                                                                           68",
