    "word": "MR No. 1335 - God to Control His Heritage\n\n        (Written August 1, 1895, at Granville, N.S.W., Australia.) \n\n     I am unable to put away the anxious thoughts that fill my mind in regard to the work of God. I feel that to weep would be a relief. I am sure that a work must be done for those in positions of trust in Battle Creek. They will never be safe, trustworthy men until they are laborers together with God. The question often comes to me, \"Has God chosen these men to devise and plan and execute in behalf of His work, when they have not a vital connection with Him?\" The men God chooses to bear burdens in His work are to sit at the feet of Jesus, and learn from Him how to repress their unChristlike desires and inclinations. God has not given men power to interfere between a human being and his conscience.",
