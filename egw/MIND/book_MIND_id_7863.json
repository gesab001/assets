    "word": "Close Relation Between Eating and Mind.--In connection with the injunction of Peter that we are to add \"to temperance patience,\" I referred [in an address] to the blessings of health reform, and the advantages to be gained by the use of proper combinations of simple, nourishing foods. The close relationship that eating and drinking sustain to the state of one's mind and temper was dwelt upon.
