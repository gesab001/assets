    "word": "The inspired record says of Him: \"Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man\" (Luke 2:52). As He grew in years He grew in knowledge. He lived temperately; His precious hours were not wasted in dissipating pleasures. He had a truly healthy body and true powers of mind. His physical and mental powers could be expanded and developed as yours or any other youth's. The Word of God was His study, as it should be yours.",
