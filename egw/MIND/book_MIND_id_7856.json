    "word": "Peter and Body-Mind Relationship.--The apostle Peter understood the relation between the mind and the body and raised his voice in warning to his brethren: \"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from freshly lusts, which war against the soul\" (1 Peter 2:11). Many regard this text as a warning against licentiousness only; but it has a broader meaning. It forbids every injurious gratification of appetite or passion. Every perverted appetite becomes a warring lust. Appetite was given us for a good purpose, not to become the minister of death by being perverted, and thus degenerating into \"lusts which war against the soul.\" [SEE NEXT CHAPTER, \"DIET AND MIND.\"]--CTBH 53, 54, 1890. (CD 166, 167.)",
