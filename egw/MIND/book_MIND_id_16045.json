    "word": "Your little ones are quick and observing in the presence of older persons. You are molding their minds to think as you think, to act as you act; not to bow the knee to the Sovereign of the universe because you do not do so. It is bad enough and fearful enough to contemplate the loss of your own souls unless you surrender to God, to contemplate that you are not entering in at the door of salvation yourselves, but it is more terrible to think that you bar the way to the entrance of your children. . . . Forget for once all about your dignity and social position, and start out before your children as learners in the school of Christ. Tell them frankly that you have made a mistake in neglecting to acknowledge yourself as a child of God. Tell them that you want that as a family you should now commence to live for God, and them read and pray with your children. . . .",
