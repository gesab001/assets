    "word": "You may not think so now, because your senses are not spiritually awake. It may seem to you that much is to be gained and little is to be lost by remaining in a large degree insensible to the claims of God upon your heart, and deaf to His voice. But in the whispering of the Spirit of God to you is the power of God to quicken and elevate your mind and make you happy, if you will but surrender yourself, soul, body, and spirit, to His control. \"How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then follow him\" [1 Kings 18:21].",
