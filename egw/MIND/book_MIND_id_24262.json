    "word": "I want you to get your minds on the possibilities of a thorough conversion; for when this experience comes to you, you will strike a note that will be recognized as having its origin in God.

God will accept us as we come to Him in our weakness, and will impart to us that which we so greatly need--the spirit of perfect submission to the will of God.--MS. 53, 1912.",
