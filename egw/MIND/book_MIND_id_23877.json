    "word": "We ought to have seen the evil of allowing certain ones to control the preparation of food for the Retreat. Hot biscuit and flesh meat are entirely out of harmony with health reform principles. If we would allow reason to take the place of impulse and love of selfish indulgence, we would not taste of the flesh of dead animals. That is more repulsive to the sense of smell than a shop where flesh meats are kept for sale. The smell of raw flesh is offensive to all whose senses have not been depraved by the culture of unnatural appetites. What more unpleasant sight to a reflective mind than the beasts slain to be devoured. Persons who live largely on a meat diet are in danger of putrefaction should they contract disease. If the light God has given in regard to Health reform is disregarded, He will not work a miracle to keep in health those who are pursuing a course to make themselves sick. \n\n\n                                   - 70 -",
