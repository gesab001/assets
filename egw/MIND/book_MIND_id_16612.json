    "word": "Comfort your heart, my brother, by believing that the Lord wants you to be saved, and that you are His child. Do not think that your mind must be in a certain state of feeling or else you are not accepted of God. Your faith must rely not on feeling, but on the promises of God. Walk by faith in a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Rest your case with the Lord, and believe in His Word. Believe, oh, believe the Word of the Lord, and walk by faith, not by sight. Consecrate yourself anew to God. Be loyal and true to a \"Thus saith the Lord,\" and stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ doth make you free.--Letter 388, Nov. 19, 1907, to a church member in South Lancaster, Massachusetts.",
