I sincerely hope that you will be contented to stay where you are and enjoy your little home in peace and happiness. \n                                                                           70\nThere is no reason why you should not enjoy the peace of Christ and His precious grace every day.  I ask you not to place yourselves where your trials will be tenfold heavier than they now are.  I have a special interest in your case, and pray that you will let the Lord mold and fashion you for the future, immortal life. -- Letter 326, 1908.",
