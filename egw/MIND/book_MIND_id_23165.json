    "word": "I had a long good talk last Sabbath with Elder Smith. Read many articles to him and I think his mind will be enlightened. I then, yesterday morning, had a long session in my good pleasant room with Elders Kilgore, Olsen, Underwood, Farnsworth and Dan Jones. I read to them for three hours letters written to Elder Butler by me and letters that he had written to me and articles written by me while in Minneapolis and read to the General Conference there assembled I had read these all to Cap. Eldridge and the voice of Captain Eldridge and all the committee was these articles should be put in print just as they are for the delegates of the Conference to have in their hands. Then there can be from this material for another Testimony, No. 34, which I must get out. I see so much before me. I feel almost dizzy in contemplating it but the Lord will give strength and grace for me to do all that there needs to be done.",
