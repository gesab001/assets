    "word": "Here we look at the cross of Calvary. What has made us look at it? Christ is drawing us. Angels of God are in this world, at work upon human minds, and the man is drawn to the One who uplifts him, and the One who \n\n\n                                        -8- \n\nuplifts him draws him to repentance. It is no work of his own; there is nothing that he can do that is of any value at all except to believe.",
