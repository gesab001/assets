    "word": "You should search the Bible, for it tells you of Jesus. I want you to read the Bible and see the matchless charms of Jesus. I want you to fall in love with the Man of Calvary, so that at every step you can say to the world, \n\n\n                                   -251- \n\n\"His ways are ways of pleasantness, and all His paths are peace\" (See Proverbs 3:17). You want to represent Christ to the world. You want to show to the world you have a hope big with immortality. You want to drink of the waters of salvation. You want the heavenly angels to be in your dwelling. You want Christ to abide there. You want to teach your children to love and fear God. You want the Sun of Righteousness shining in the darkened chambers of your mind, and you want thanksgiving to God on your lips.",
