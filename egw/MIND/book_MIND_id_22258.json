    "word": "Let us remember that it means much to the educators and those being educated in our sanitariums to keep the Sabbath aright. This should be regarded as much more important and essential than it has been in the past. Testing truth is to be given to the world. Men are to be taught that the seventh day is God's memorial of creation. Yet this truth is not to be presented in such a way as to render it offensive. The light is to shine forth in such a way that it will illuminate the minds of all.--Letter 14, 1901. \n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nFebruary 28, 1991. Entire Letter.",
