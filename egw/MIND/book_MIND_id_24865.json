    "word": "Brother Shireman has solicited testimonials from men of influence - from ministers and men in high official position - in praise of his work.

I do not want Brother and Sister Shireman to hurt their influence for good; but they will, I fear, unless they learn to recognize the necessity of connecting with the school work persons of varied talents.",
