    "word": "Bible may be read by ministers so impressively that listeners never forget them.--When I was only about eleven years old, I heard a minister read the account of Peter's imprisonment, as recorded in the book of Acts; and he read in so impressive a manner that the details of the story in all their reality seemed to be passing before my eyes. So deep was the impression made upon my mind that I have never forgotten it.--VSS 392, 393.",
