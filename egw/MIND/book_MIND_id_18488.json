    "word": "Sr. Tabor has been far from God. Her heart has not been subdued by grace. Her love of the world, and of the things that are in the world, has closed her heart to the love of God. The love of dress, of appearance, has kept her from good, and led her to place her mind and affections upon these frivolous things. Unbelief has been gaining strength in her heart, and she has had less and less love for the truth, and could see but little attraction in the simplicity of true godliness.",
