    "word": "29\n \n     This Kind of Management Must Change--Did the Lord counsel you to devise the various means to work and control human minds?  No, I tell you, no.  The case of Elder Littlejohn has been strangely mismanaged.  He has appealed to me to set things right, but I have done nothing about it; it was not the time.  Your course in the treatment of him was all wrong.  It bears the signature of the adversary of souls.  Your treatment of Frank Belden in his work was not right; it is strange fire, not the fire of God's kindling.  This kind of management must come to an end, else God will work in a way that will not be pleasing to those who have done this work.  These men have not been right, they needed judicious management, but those who tried to manage them needed themselves to be managed.",
