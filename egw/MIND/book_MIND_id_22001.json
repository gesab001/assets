    "word": "Elder Maxson was a man determined to have his own way. When this light was given, some would accept and some would close their minds and hearts to all the evidence given of the Lord. They followed their own way, and two parties were created, not agreeing among themselves. Those who had taken their stand upon the light given held firmly to the position that the Lord was leading His people through genuine experience; but some who wanted to have their own way in the sanitarium acted out their own disposition, refused all correction of their errors that the Lord had graciously given, and talked their unbelief. Thus two parties have been formed.",
