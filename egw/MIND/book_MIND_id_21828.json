    "word": "Imitate the great Teacher, give lessons that are clear and plain, not complicated, not buried up with a mass of words. Few words spoken plainly, clearly, presented in humility and the meekness of Christ will reach hearts, while the many words cannot be retained and are as a lot of waste paper thrown into a wastebasket, to be lost as rubbish. Few words, distinct and simple, will accomplish far more that a multitude of words which confuse the mind and will not interest, so that nothing stands out clear and forcible.",
