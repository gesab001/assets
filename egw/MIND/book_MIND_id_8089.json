    "word": "Not All Think Alike.--Wholehearted service is required in dealing with minds. Let us remember this. Often we are tempted to criticize a man standing in a high position of responsibility because he does not do as we think he ought to do. But the one who has so many responsibilities to carry needs not the criticism of his fellow workers; he needs their encouragement, their forbearance, their patience, and their prayers. He needs the abiding presence of Christ; for it is not always that he has wise, unprejudiced men to counsel with.",
