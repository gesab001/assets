    "word": "JAMES WHITE, IN AN 1872 ARTICLE, ON \"SWINE'S FLESH,\" DOES SHOW THE BEGINNINGS OF A WIDER APPLICATION OF LEVITICAL LAW. HE DOES MENTION DEUTERONOMY 14:8 AGAIN, AND HE \n                                                                           2\nDOES SEEK TO REFUTE THE ARGUMENTS THAT THE PROHIBITION ON SWINE WAS A MERELY JEWISH ONE, AND THEREFORE NOT BINDING ON CHRISTIANS. HE REMINDS HIS READERS THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CLEAN AND UNCLEAN WAS RECOGNIZED IN THE BIBLE LONG BEFORE THE \"EXISTENCE OF A SINGLE JEW.\" STILL, THE WHOLE THRUST OF HIS ARGUMENT IS TO DISCREDIT THE PIG, NOT TO ESTABLISH GENERAL CATEGORIES OF CLEAN AND UNCLEAN MEATS. HE DOES NOT DISCUSS THE BIBLICAL CRITERIA FOR THE DISTINCTION AT ALL.",
