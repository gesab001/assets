    "word": "At the time of organization, the churches in Ohio, especially at Gilboa, held back and began to watch and criticize and find fault. Brother Butler and the church viewed things in the wrong light, and he wrote out the minds of the church. He had in honesty done his part to bring them to that state of mind, but when he spoke he spoke the minds of the church. When the matter was presented as it really was, all should have been convinced that the enemy had presented the matter to them in an exaggerated form. Brother Butler manifested too much stubbornness and the church did not do him justice. They stepped back and threw all the blame upon Brother Butler. This was wrong.",
