    "word": "Oh, how many opportunities have come and gone when they could have been a blessing had they but been converted! But their minds are mixed with contradictory sentiments, and they have not perception to distinguish the wheat from the tares. May the Lord pity and forgive these unfaithful workers who dishonor God and do not love Jesus nor the truth. Self and self-righteousness are as filthy rags, yet they cling to them and will not receive the garments of Christ's righteousness. Christ says of these unfaithful stewards, \"Ye have not honored Me in receiving My messengers; ye have not honored Me with your substance. Ye did it not unto Me. The opportunity has come and gone and thus stands your record in the great book of account. Thou gavest Me no water for My feet; thou gavest Me not the care and devotion of thy heart; My head with oil thou didst not anoint.\" Oh, my God, grant that these souls may not always be under the educating power of the arch deceiver!",
