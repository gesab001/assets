    "word": "If those who claim to believe the truth misrepresent their Lord they are false lights. They neither burn nor shine. Their sentiments and practices are so mingled with the sentiments and practices of the world that there is scarcely any difference between them and the world. They cherish the same self-love, have the same hungering after foolish pleasures, the same thirsting for amusement. Of them the word declares that they are \"heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\" They are professedly serving God, but serving Him after the fashion of the world. They are presenting to the world a distorted image of what constitutes a Christian. They are molding the minds of those with whom they associate to a low standard of religious life. The irreligious class are degraded by the example of those who profess to be Christians, and yet present to the world only a worldly religion.\"--Letter 12a, 1893, pp. 11, 14, 15.
