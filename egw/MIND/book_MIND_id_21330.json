    "word": "May the Lord bless you abundantly, my brother, in your home. The charge I have to give you is: Do not load yourself down with so many burdens that you will fail to do your duty to your children. I do not write these words as a reproach, but as a reminder. If anything must be neglected, let it be the care of inanimate things. Keep your own soul fresh and pure and uplifted. If you give your children the attention they need, some things may have to be neglected. Then let them be. Your children are building characters for time and for eternity, and you must make no mistakes in dealing with them. Be assured that I will not censure you for anything left undone on the farm.",
