    "word": "MR No. 497 - Cutting Thrusts in Discussions are Wrong\n\n     Some in discussion think [that] if they create a laugh against their opponent and place his views in a comical light they have done a nice thing. They divert the minds in a wrong channel; they befog the truth of God; they do not show reverence for the Word of God; they do not evidence that their own human spirit is under the controlling influence of the Spirit of God. They place the truth on a level with common things. A sharp, cutting application is frequently made by the men who claim to be teaching the truth. It is not the truth that does the cutting, but . . . the words of the speaker.",
