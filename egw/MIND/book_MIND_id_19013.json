    "word": "Home School \n\n     1. Bible.--\"The Bible should be the child's first textbook. From this book parents are to give wise instruction. . . . From it the children are to learn that God is their Father; and from the beautiful lessons of His Word they are to gain a knowledge of His character. Through the inculcation of its principles, they are to learn to do justice and judgment. . . . Parents, let the instruction you give your children be simple, and be sure that it is clearly understood. The lessons that you learn from the Word you are to present to their young minds so plainly that they cannot fail to understand. By simple lessons drawn from the Word of God and their own experience, you may teach them how to conform their lives to the highest standard.\"--Counsels, pp. 108, 109.",
