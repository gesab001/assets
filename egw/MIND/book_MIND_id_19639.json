    "word": "The Lord has a great work to be done. Changes are continually taking place. In our association with those of different nationality, education, and experience we shall find that it is a life and death struggle to bear forward the gospel in all its purity. . . . Paul wrote to Timothy, his son in the gospel, \"God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God, who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our own works, but according to His purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began.\"--Ms 31, 1900, pp. 2, 5.
