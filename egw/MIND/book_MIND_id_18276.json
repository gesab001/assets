    "word": "AND IT CAME TO THE PLACE AT LAST, THAT, FOR SOME TIME I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WOULD DO THIS THING; BUT ABOUT A MONTH AGO A TESTIMONY \n                                                                           4\nCAME THAT MADE THE THING STILL MORE PLAIN, AND THEN I SETTLED IT THAT I WOULD DO SO THE FIRST CHANCE I GOT. AT THAT TIME BROTHER EVANS WAS AWAY, AND OTHERS--BROTHER MORRISON WAS AWAY AT CAMP-MEETINGS AT THAT TIME; AND LATER ELDER EVANS WAS AWAY AGAIN ON HIS TRIP TO MANITOBA. AND SO I TOLD BROTHER SISLEY A WEEK OR TEN DAYS, PROBABLY TWO WEEKS AGO, THAT JUST AS SOON AS THE WHOLE BOARD COULD BE GOT TOGETHER, I WANTED A MEETING OF IT. AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR NOW, BRETHREN. AND BY HUNTING THROUGH ALL THE TESTIMONIES THAT I HAVE HAD ACCESS TO, I AM SURE THAT I HAVE FOUND AT LEAST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE TESTIMONIES REFER TO. I SAID A WHILE AGO THAT I DO NOT LAY ANY BLAME ON ANYBODY AT ALL; I DO NOT INTEND TO ATTACH ANY BLAME TO ANY MEMBER OF THE BOARD FOR NOT DOING WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE, ALTHOUGH IT WAS LAID UPON THE BOARD TO DO IT. IN SEARCHING THROUGH THIS THING, I AM SURE I HAVE FOUND JUST WHAT THE LORD MEANS BY ROBBERY, AND WHERE THE THING LIES; THE TESTIMONIES POINT IT OUT. AND WHEN HE POINTS IT OUT PLAINLY, AND LAYS IT BEFORE YOU, AND CALLS UPON YOU TO CORRECT IT, AND RESTORE WHAT HAS BEEN ROBBED, THEN IN HIS NAME, AND ON HIS TESTIMONY, I CALL UPON THE BOARD TO DO THAT, AND I BELIEVE THE BOARD WILL DO IT.",
