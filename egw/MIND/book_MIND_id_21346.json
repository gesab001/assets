    "word": "There was Brother Leroy Nicola, whom the Lord has blessed with ability. If his will were subdued to God's will, then a work would be accomplished for him that would make him an instrument of righteousness; but just as long as he cherishes doubts, as long as he feels at liberty to criticize, he will not grow spiritually. The dark shadows will encompass him, uncertainty and discouragements will take possession of reason, and he who feels too proud to bend his will is found weak as a child in moral strength and often almost helpless. Why will he not be healed? He has not the consoling consciousness that he has the Spirit and favor of God. He is educating his mind to doubt and criticize.",
