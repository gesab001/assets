    "word": "Elder Olsen, the present state of things has continued long enough. Your eyesight has become imperfect. You link up with men whom God is not leading. You accept as sound the prepositions of men, who in some things start you on a wrong track; for you sanction these prepositions, and give them authority and power. I am not sorry that these things, which have been so long brewing in unsanctified minds, have become more pronounced, that you may the better discern their true character before some other agent shall come in to preside over the Conference in your place. I now beg of you to arise in the name of the Lord, and he will help you to retrieve the errors of the past, that are leading to serious results.",
