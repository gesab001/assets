    "word": "Counsels Regarding Motherhood [REVIEW AND HERALD, JULY 25, 1899.] \n\n\n     Every woman about to become a mother whatever may be her surroundings, should encourage constantly a happy, contented disposition, knowing that for all her efforts in this direction she will be repaid tenfold in the physical, as well as in the moral, character of her offspring. Nor is this all. By habit she can accustom herself to cheerful thinking, and thus encourage a happy state of mind, and cast a cheerful reflection of her own happiness of spirit upon her family and those with whom she associates.",
