    "word": "We are not to be blind; we may see the prejudices which are cherished by those with whom we associate, we may see the errors that hinder their religious growth, we may discern their instability of opinion, their partiality of action; but because we see this, we should not feel that we are superior to them, measuring ourselves among ourselves, and leaning to our own understanding.

No living man should come in to take the place of God in our mind. . . .",
