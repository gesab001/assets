    "word": "If the influence in our College is what it should be, the youth who are educated there will be enabled to discern God, and glorify him in all his works. And while engaged in cultivating the faculties which God has given them, they will be preparing to render to him more efficient service. The intellect, sanctified, will unlock the treasures of God's word, and gather its precious gems to present to other minds, and lead them also to search for the deep things of God. A knowledge of the riches of this grace, will ennoble and elevate the human soul, and through connection with Christ, it will become a partaker of the divine nature, and obtain power to resist the advances of Satan.",
