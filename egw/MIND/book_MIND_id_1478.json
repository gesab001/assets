    "word": "Mothers sacrifice to fashion the God-given time which should be devoted to forming the character of their children. Health is impaired by bending over sewing, within doors, shut away from the sunshine and pure air. Opportunities are lost that should be improved in educating the mind, and storing it with useful knowledge. Thus they are not qualified to instruct and train their children for usefulness in this world, or to fit them for the better world. Women are bending their shoulders to a heavy cross. Should Christ demand of them, as his disciples, so great a sacrifice, they would feel that it was indeed too great, and the cross too heavy. Christ requires none of his followers to lift so heavy a burden as that to which they subject themselves as slaves of fashion.",
