    "word": "At this time when every conceivable thing is being brought in to confuse the people of God, let your spiritual eyesight be strengthened; let your faith in the Word of God be firm. Know for yourselves that the words and teachings of Christ, which are the words and teachings of Jehovah, contain the highest instruction it is possible for men to gain. When any would seek to confuse your minds, repeat to them the words of Christ, \"No man can serve two masters\" (Matthew 6:24). Let the Word of the Lord stand forth clearly and distinctly.",
