    "word": "Adam and Eve were given the garden of Eden to care for. They were \"to dress it and to keep it.\" They were happy in their work. Mind, heart, and will acted in perfect harmony. In their labor they found no weariness, no toil. Their hours were filled with useful work and communion with each other. Their occupation was pleasant. God and Christ visited them and talked with them. They were given perfect freedom. Only one restriction was placed on them. \"Of every tree in the garden thou mayest freely eat,\" God said, \"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die\" (Genesis 2:16, 17).",
