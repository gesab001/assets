    "word": "You need to realize that you can not be a complete whole. There are responsibilities that others must carry. There are others whose qualifications are fully as essential as your own to the progress of the work. Every worker needs to guard himself against thinking that he is a complete whole. My brother, you should learn that wherever you are in God's service, other minds besides yours should be brought into connection with the work. You will desire to do things that in your judgment should be done. But your will is not always to be followed.

In your board-meetings let the other members fully express their minds. Do not regard your own judgment as fully sufficient to decide matters without any other voice. \n                                                                           1788",
