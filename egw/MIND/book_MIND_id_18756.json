    "word": "In laying up treasures in Heaven, remember it is not lost. It is for yourselves. It is securing these treasures to yourselves by a judicious use of the means of which Heaven has made you a steward. Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.",
