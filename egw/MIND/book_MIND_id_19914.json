    "word": "Matters have been opened before me that have greatly burdened my soul. A great pressure is being brought into the Office. [ELLEN WHITE DOES NOT FURTHER DEFINE THIS PRESSURE. THE PARAGRAPH PRECEDING THIS REFERS TO DANIEL'S EXPERIENCE IN WITNESSING FOR GOD.] The Lord is not pleased with any such pressure. Have you thought whether your solicitations for work in worldly or religious lines are of a character to do service for God? You gain nothing by receiving a class of literature that will unsettle the faith of the workers in the principles of Christianity. My brethren, will you not reason from cause to effect. The time taken to publish matters that do an evil work is worse than wasted. Thus Satan is introduced into the Office. His sophistry is surely being aided by those who help in the promulgation of this literature. If the work solicited is of a character to give a wrong tendency to the minds of the youth, it were better not to accept this work; for it is work that God condemns.",
