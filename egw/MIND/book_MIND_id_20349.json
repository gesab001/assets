White] will tell you himself that it is I that present the situation to him. . . .He does not seem to want to tell me anything about the Southern California meeting. Scarcely anything has he told me--only some points that he knows would not trouble my mind. He does not feel like opening things to me, but I come to him with manuscripts, and I tell him, This must be copied, and sent out just as quickly as it can be. Now I have light, mostly in the night season, just as if the whole thing were transacting, and I viewing it, and as I am listening to the conversation, I am moved to get up and meet it. This is the way it is; and then in the morning I tell him about it. Often he doesn't say a word--not a word; but after a while, when I have written and written, then he acknowledges that it is so. He is quite sure \n\n\n                                    -189- \n\nthat it is so, because he was there, but he did not tell me.-- Manuscript 105, 1907, pp. 1-3.
