    "word": "Dear Brethren in Denver: You ask in regard to the wisdom of placing a colored brother as superintendent of your Sabbath school. There are reasons why this would not be advisable. For the spiritual good of the brother this should not be done. And if continued it would prove a detriment to the Sabbath School. In many minds there is a strong prejudice against the colored people, and as a result of such a move, constant difficulties would arise, which would hinder the growth and advancement of the school. From the light that has been given me for years in the past, I know that all would not show to a colored man the respect which for the good of a Sabbath School should be shown to the superintendent. . . . \n\n\n                                    -19-",
