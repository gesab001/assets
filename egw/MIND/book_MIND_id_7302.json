    "word": "The Chaff and the Wheat \n\n     Dear youth, cease to read the magazines containing stories. Put away every novel. . . . We would do well to clear our houses of all the story magazines and the publications containing ridiculous pictures --representations originated by satanic agencies. The youth cannot afford to poison their minds with such things. \"What is the chaff to the wheat?\" Let every one who claims to be a follower of Christ read only that which is true and of eternal value.",
