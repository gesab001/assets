    "word": "The question may arise in some minds why we as a people are separated from the world into little companies. We answer, It is not because we choose to differ from those around us, but because we see the necessity of obeying all the requirements of God. If any feel that it is of no consequence whether we obey all his commandments or not, they have only to look back to Eden to see what dire results befell Adam and Eve because of disobedience. It is for us to choose whether we will go over the same ground as they in transgression, or whether we will walk in the light that has shone upon us, and be found of our heavenly Father in the path of humble obedience. His blessings and promises are for those who love and obey him.",
