    "word": "Business to be Reserved. \n\n     The State camp-meetings are not as efficient as they should be in bringing about spiritual advancement, because many matters pertaining to temporal, earthly things are brought in to occupy the mind. That which relates to business should be reserved to be attended to by those who are appointed to give attention to these matters. And as far as possible these business matters should be brought before the churches at some other time.",
