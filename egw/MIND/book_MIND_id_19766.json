    "word": "Let the capacities of the mind expand that you may take in the heavenly beauties and the blessed promises. Only believe in Jesus and learn in the school of the greatest Teacher the world ever knew, and His grace will act mightily upon the intellect and heart. This teaching gives clearness to the mental vision. It gives compass to the power of the thought; ideas are created, the soul hunger is filled. The heart is softened and subdued and filled with glowing love, that neither discouragement, despondency, affliction, nor trial can quench. God will open to the mind's eye [to] His preciousness and His fullness. Then let us labor and love.--Letter 29, 1889, pp. 5-9. (To Brother and Sister Buckner, November 8, 1889.)",
