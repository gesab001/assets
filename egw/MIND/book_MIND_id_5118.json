    "word": "Care in Training the Youth \n\n     The Lord has presented to me, in many ways and at various times, how carefully we should deal with the young,--that it requires the finest discrimination to deal with minds. Every one who has to do with the education and training of youth, needs to live very close to the great Teacher, to catch His spirit and manner of work. Lessons are to be given which will affect their character and life-work.",
