    "word": "Jesus is ready to do great things for us when we lay ourselves upon the altar, a living, consuming sacrifice. \u201cI will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\u201d How? Through the spirit of Christ. It is through the infinite sacrifice of Christ that this high estimate has been placed upon man. When we have his spirit in our hearts, we shall be of one mind in him. We shall not then seek to cover up the defects in our characters; but we shall strive earnestly to overcome them. Our eyes will be fixed upon Jesus, and we shall learn from him to dwell in love and harmony with one another here, and shall finally be permitted to dwell with Christ and angels and all the redeemed throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity. \n     Friday morning, Sept. 18.",
