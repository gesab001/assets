    "word": "But if the dead are already enjoying the bliss of Heaven or writhing in the flames of hell, what need of a future Judgment? The teachings of God's word on these important points are neither obscure nor contradictory; they may be understood by common minds. But what candid mind can see either wisdom or justice in the current theory? Will the righteous, after the investigation of their cases at the Judgment, receive the commendation, \"Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,\" when they have been dwelling in his presence, perhaps for long ages? Are the wicked summoned from the place of torment to receive the sentence from the Judge of all the earth, \"Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire\"? Oh, solemn mockery! shameful impeachment of the wisdom and justice of God! \n                                                                           369",
