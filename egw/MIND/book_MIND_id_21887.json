    "word": "We are placed on vantage ground because Christ has overcome in our behalf. He has made every provision for us to overcome. Divine power stands behind every will resolutely set to do the right. God has provided the armor and the weapons with which each one is to fight. Let the soldiers of Christ put on the whole armor of God and flinch not at Satan's attacks. Let them bear in mind that they will not be crowned unless they strive lawfully. The principles contained in the law of God are to be maintained at any cost. Success in the Christian warfare means watchfulness and a daily crucifixion of self.",
