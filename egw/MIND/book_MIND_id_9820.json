    "word": "The words of Christ, though calmly spoken, were uttered with an earnestness and power that stirred the hearts of the people. . . . They \"were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes\" (Matthew 7:28, 29, R.V.). The Pharisees noted the vast difference between their manner of instruction and that of Christ. They saw that the majesty and purity and beauty of the truth, with its deep and gentle influence, was taking firm hold upon many minds. The Saviour's divine love and tenderness drew the hearts of men to Him. . . .",
