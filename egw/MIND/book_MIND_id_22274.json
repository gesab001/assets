I could not sleep after half past twelve o'clock tonight. I was conversing with you, and the Spirit of the Lord came upon me as I presented some things before you. I was telling you that the Lord had shown me that the minds and spirits and characters of His workers needed to be molded and fashioned before He could work in and through them.",
