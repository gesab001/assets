    "word": "A Desire to Change the Present Order \n\n     Instead of living in expectation of some special season of excitement, we are wisely to improve present opportunity, doing that which must be done in order that souls may be saved. Instead of exhausting the powers of our mind in speculations in regard to the times and seasons which the Lord has placed in His own power, and withheld from men, we are to yield ourselves to the control of the Holy Spirit, to do present duties, to give the bread of life, unadulterated with human opinions, to souls who are perishing for the truth. . . .",
