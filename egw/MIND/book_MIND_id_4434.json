    "word": "Too often, as the studies accumulate, the wisdom from above has been given a secondary place, and the further advanced the student becomes, the less confidence he has in God; he considers that much learning is the very essence of success in life; but if all would give due consideration to the statement of Christ, they would make different plans: \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" Without the vital principles of \n                                                                           350\ntrue religion, without knowledge of how to serve and glorify the Redeemer, education is more harmful than beneficial. When education in human lines is pushed to such an extent that the love of God wanes in the heart, that prayer is neglected, and that there is a failure to cultivate spiritual attributes, it is wholly disastrous. It would be far better to cease seeking to obtain an education, and to recover your soul from its languishing condition, than to gain the best of educations, and lose sight of eternal advantages. There are many who are crowding too many studies into a limited period of time. They are overworking their mental powers; and as a consequence they see many things in a perverted light. They are not content in following the prescribed course of study, but feel that injustice is done them when, in their selfish ambition, they are not permitted to carry all the studies that they desire to carry. They become unbalanced in mind. They do not consider the fact that they would obtain a better qualification for the work of the Master if they would pursue a course that would not work injury to their physical, mental, and moral powers; but in overburdening the mind, they bring upon themselves life-long physical infirmities that cripple their powers, and unfit them for future usefulness.",
