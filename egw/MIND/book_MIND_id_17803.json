I have observed children allowed to come up in this way. Whether at home or abroad, they are either restless or dreamy, and are unable to converse save upon the most common-place subjects. The nobler faculties, those adapted to higher pursuits, have been degraded to the contemplation of trivial, or worse than trivial subjects, until their possessor has become satisfied with such topics and scarcely has power to reach anything higher.--Christian Education, pp. 185, 186.",
