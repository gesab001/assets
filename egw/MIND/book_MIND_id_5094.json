    "word": "Effect of Receiving the Spirit \n\n     When one is fully emptied of self, when every false god is cast out of the soul, the vacuum is filled by the inflowing of the Spirit of Christ. Such a one has the faith that purifies the soul from defilement. He is conformed to the Spirit, and he minds the things of the Spirit. He has no confidence in self. Christ is all and in all. He receives with meekness the truth that is constantly being unfolded, and gives the Lord all the glory, saying, \"God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit.\" \"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\" [1 Corinthians 2:10, 12.]",
