    "word": "The happiness of men and women is in their obedience to the laws of God. In their obedience to God\u2019s law they are surrounded as with a hedge and kept from the evil. They cannot be happy and depart from God\u2019s specified requirements, and set up a standard of their own, which they decide they can safely follow. Then there would be a variety of standards to suit the different minds, and the government [would be] taken out of the Lord\u2019s hands and human beings [would] grasp the reins of government. The law of self is erected, the will of humankind is made supreme, and when the high and holy will of God is presented to be obeyed, respected, and honored the human will wants its own way to do its own promptings, and there is a controversy between the human agent and the divine.",
