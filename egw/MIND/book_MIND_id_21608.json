    "word": "My brethren in positions of responsibility, remember that you are not to keep in suspense the men and women who signify their desire to work for the Master. Express your pleasure that they are willing to enter the work; give them something to do. God is stirring the minds of men and women to do much more than they have done. In all our institutions--our sanitariums, publishing houses, and schools--we need fathers and mothers in Israel, men and women quick to discern the needs of those who for a time require help and encouragement, in order that they may develop into useful workers.",
