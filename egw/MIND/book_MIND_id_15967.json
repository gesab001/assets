    "word": "How vividly before my mind was the boat with the disciples buffeting the waves. The night was dark and tempestuous. Their Master was absent. The sea was strong, the winds contrary.

They are beset with danger and horror. These were strong men, accustomed to hardships and perils, and not easily intimidated with danger.",
