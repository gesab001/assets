    "word": "There are here in this school young people of various character. There are some here of a light and trifling disposition, some who give very little heed to where they are standing spiritually. But we desire you to become decidedly in earnest in regard to your soul's salvation, for it means everything to you. And it means much to the school, how you shall conduct yourselves. If you will determine to lay aside all folly, all vanity, and all frivolity, you will thus be helping to elevate this school to the position that God would have it occupy. You cannot afford to follow the inclinations of your own unconverted minds, and not try to obtain the victory that has been made possible for you through the sacrifice of Christ. We trust that you may see the King in His beauty.",
