    "word": "Dangerous things have been written and dangerous things have been said, which God declares that our youth should not hear. I am bidden to say in the name of the Lord, \"Beware of the leaven of philosophy and false science that has been introduced among the medical missionary workers at Battle Creek. Beware of the spiritualistic leaven that has already been placed in the meal, to leaven many minds. By the introduction of this leaven, the messages sent by God to His people are made of no effect. The leaven works until the whole mass is leavened.\"",
