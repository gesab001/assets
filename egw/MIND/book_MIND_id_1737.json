    "word": "When Jesus first met the disciples in the upper chamber [following His resurrection], Thomas was not with them. He heard the reports of the others, and received abundant proof that Jesus had risen; but gloom and unbelief filled his heart. . . . He was determined not to believe, and for a whole week he brooded over his wretchedness, which seemed all the darker in contrast with the hope and faith of his brethren. . . . He ardently loved his Lord, but he had allowed jealousy and unbelief to take possession of his mind and heart.",
