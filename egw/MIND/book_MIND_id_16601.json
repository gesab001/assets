    "word": "Christ came to this earth to reveal what finite minds can comprehend of the glory of God. He came to unite divinity and humanity, that through Him, with character made perfect, human beings might at last behold God in the fullness of His glory. Through the merits of the sacrifice He has made, we may become \"partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust\" (2 Peter 1:4). The bright beams of divinity pass through Christ to His followers. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1:12). . . .",
