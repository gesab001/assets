    "word": "I saw that a very extensive work could not be accomplished in a short time, as it would not be an easy matter to find physicians whom God could approve and who would work together harmoniously, disinterestedly, and zealously for the good of suffering humanity.

This object cannot be secured by working merely from the worldling\u2019s standpoint.
