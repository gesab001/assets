    "word": "While Bro. Andrews was giving time and attention to these unconsecrated ones, to save them from trial, he allowed burdens and responsibilities to drop with weight upon my husband, who was them too feeble to bear them. Bro. Andrews did not mean to do wrong in any way; but he had his mind centered upon a few, and neglected to lift the burdens where they most needed \n                                                                           70\nto be lifted. Bro. Andrews exalted Bro. and sister Hale, and they, in their turn, thought Bro. Andrews a perfect man. They believed in his discernment, and thought themselves greatly abused by others because they did not make as much of them as Bro. Andrews had done. When Bro. Andrews' friends claim his attention, he will make considerable sacrifice to please them, and he frequently robs the cause of God by devoting to their personal benefit time and strength which God would have him use in a more important work. Bro. Andrews frequently injures the very ones he thinks he is benefiting. This error in Bro. Andrews is the result of cultivating one set of faculties, while he allows others to lie dormant, so that he is not well balanced.",
