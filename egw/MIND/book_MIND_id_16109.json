They \"were astonished at His teaching: for He taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.\" Matthew 7:29, R.V. The Pharisees noted the vast difference between their manner of instruction and that of Christ.

The Saviour's divine love and tenderness drew the hearts of men to Him. The rabbis saw that by His teaching the whole tenor of the instruction they had given to the people was set at nought. He was tearing down the partition wall that had been so flattering to their pride and exclusiveness; and they feared that, if permitted, He would draw the people entirely away from them. Therefore they followed Him with determined hostility, hoping to find some occasion for bringing Him into disfavor with the multitudes and thus enabling the Sanhedrin to secure His condemnation and death.",
