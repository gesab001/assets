    "word": "Whatever may be our experience or supposed intelligence, we must all become learners and receive an education in spiritual things that we may give to others. Let all bear in mind that Christ, in His life has given them  an example of the necessity of prayer. He says, \"The end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.\" \"Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\" \"Take ye heed, watch, and pray; for ye know not when the time is.\" \"Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the care of this life; and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell upon the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things which must come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\" \n\n\n                                    -152-",
