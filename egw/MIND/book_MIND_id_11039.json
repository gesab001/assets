    "word": "1-3. No Standstill in the Christian Life.--[2 Peter 1:1-3 quoted.] What a grand theme this is for contemplation--the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. Contemplating Christ and His righteousness leaves no room for self-righteousness, for the glorifying of self. In this chapter there is no standstill. There is continual advancement in every stage of the knowledge of Christ (Letter 43, 1895).  {7BC 942.10}  \n     2, 5-7. See EGW on Romans 6:1-4.  {7BC 942.11}  \n     4 (Hebrews 10:23). God Behind All His Promises.--Promises are estimated by the truth of the one who makes them. Many men make promises only to break them, \n                                                                           943\nto mock the heart that trusted in them. Those who lean upon such men lean upon broken reeds. But God is behind the promises He makes. He is ever mindful of His covenant, and His truth endureth to all generations (MS 23, 1899).  {7BC 942.12}  \n     (Ephesians 2:1-6; see EGW on Genesis 2:7; Exodus 20:1-17; Matthew 4:1-11; Hebrews 2:14-18;  4:15.) Partakers of the Divine Nature.--We must learn of Christ. We must know what He is to those He has ransomed. We must realize that through belief in Him it is our privilege to be partakers of the divine nature, and so escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. Then we are cleansed from all sin, all defects of character. We need not retain one sinful propensity. . . . [Ephesians 2:1-6 quoted.] . . .",
