    "word": "IN THIS STATE OF THINGS, HOWEVER DISCOURAGING, MRS. WHITE FEELS CALLED UPON TO RESUME HER WORK IN THIS FIELD OF LABOR, AND IN SO DOING, WILL LET HER VIEWS BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD. IT MAY BE WELL HERE TO STATE, HOWEVER, THAT WHILE SHE DOES NOT REGARD MILK, TAKEN IN LARGE QUANTITIES, AS CUSTOMARILY EATEN WITH BREAD, THE BEST ARTICLE OF FOOD, HER MIND, AS YET, HAS ONLY BEEN CALLED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BEST AND MOST HEALTHY CONDITION POSSIBLE OF THE COW, WHOSE MILK IS USED AS AN ARTICLE OF FOOD. SHE CANNOT UNITE IN CIRCULATING PUBLICATIONS BROADCAST WHICH TAKE AN EXTREME POSITION ON THE IMPORTANT QUESTION OF MILK, WITH HER PRESENT LIGHT UPON THE SUBJECT. SUCH WORKS MAY BE WELL ENOUGH WITH WELL-INFORMED HEALTH REFORMERS, AND MAY BE A PROPER GUIDE IN THE COOKING DEPARTMENT OF OUR HEALTH INSTITUTE AT BATTLE CREEK, AFTER ITS TABLES SHALL BE CLEARED OF THE HABITUAL USE OF MILK. AND SUCH WORKS MAY HAVE A GREATER INFLUENCE AMONG OUR PEOPLE WHEN OUR MINISTERS, WHO ARE ARDENT HEALTH REFORMERS, SHALL LEAVE THE FREE USE OF COW'S MILK.",
