    "word": "Our faith in eternal realities is to become stronger (293) and firmer with exercise. In every sanitarium, in every school, an upward, spiritual influence needs to be exerted. I am instructed to say to all physicians, Awake, awake, and take hold of the real issues that are for the uplifting of men and the magnifying of present truth. Let not your sense of individual responsibility become feeble. Let not your mind grow weary, while there remain your talent of speech, your pen, and the privilege of service. Let the truth, eternal truth, be brought into action to impress, to convince, to convert minds. Let us proclaim that the day of the Lord is upon us.",
