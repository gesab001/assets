    "word": "Dear youth, a disposition in you to follow fashion in your dress, and to wear lace, and gold, and artificials, for display, will not recommend your religion and the truth you profess to others. People of discernment will look upon your attempts to beautify the external, as proof of weak minds and proud hearts. Simple, plain, unpretending dress will be a recommendation to my youthful sisters. In no better way can you let your light shine to others than in your simplicity of dress and deportment. You may show to all that you place a proper estimate upon the things of this life in comparison with eternal considerations.",
