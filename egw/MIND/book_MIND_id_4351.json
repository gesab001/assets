    "word": "The converted soul lives in Christ. His darkness passes away, and a new and heavenly light shines into his soul. \"He that winneth souls is wise.\" \"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.\" What is done through the co-operation of men with God is a work that shall never perish, but endure through the eternal ages. He that makes God his wisdom, that grows up into the full stature of a man in Christ Jesus, will stand before kings, before the so-called great men of the world, and show forth the praises of Him who hath called him out of darkness into His marvelous light. Science and literature cannot bring into the darkened mind of men the light which the glorious gospel of \n                                                                           200\nthe Son of God can bring. The Son of God alone can do the great work of illuminating the soul. No wonder Paul exclaims, \"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.\" The gospel of Christ becomes personality in those who believe, and makes them living epistles, known and read of all men. In this way the leaven of godliness passes into the multitude. The heavenly intelligences are able to discern the true elements of greatness in character; for only goodness is esteemed as efficiency with God.",
