    "word": "Some years ago the matter of the publication of books came up, and plans were laid which I can not now call to mind. It was something like this,--that no one individual was to be benefited by the publication of his books. . . . A proposition was then made to us which my husband, without ability to consider fully, assented to, that the Publishing Association should have the benefit of the books. I was considering the matter, and thought like this: I wish the testimonies to go to as many as possible. They contain messages from God to His people, and I wish no benefits personally for this work. Thus we stated the matter.",
