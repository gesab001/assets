    "word": "In one of his most impressive lessons \n                                                                           15\nChrist says, \"Behold the fowls of the air; for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your Heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?\" The great Teacher is here leading out minds to understand the parental care and love which God has for his children. He directs them to observe the birds flitting from tree to tree, or skimming upon the bosom of the lake, without a flutter of distrust or fear. God's eye is upon these little creatures; he provides them food; he answers all their simple wants. Jesus inquires, \"Are ye not much better than they?\" Then why despond, or look into the future with sadness and foreboding?",
