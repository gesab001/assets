    "word": "The Result of Failing to Work \n\n     Comparatively little missionary work is done, and what is the result? The truths that Christ gave are not taught. Many of God's people are not growing in grace. Many are in an unpleasant, complaining frame of mind. Those who are not helping others to see the importance of the truth for this time must feel dissatisfied with themselves. Satan takes advantage of this feature in their experience and leads them to criticize and find fault. If they were busily engaged in seeking to know and do the will of God they would feel such a burden for perishing souls, such an unrest of mind, that they could not be restrained from fulfilling the commission: \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" Mark 16:15. \n                                                                           40",
