    "word": "Dwell on the Affirmative Truths.--Dwell not on the negative points of questions that arise, but gather to your minds affirmative truths, and fasten them there by much study and earnest prayer and heart consecration. Keep your lamps trimmed and burning; and let bright rays shine forth, that men, beholding your good works, may be led to glorify your Father which is in heaven.",
