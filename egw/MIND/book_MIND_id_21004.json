    "word": "Preble [J. N. ANDREWS PUBLISHED A SERIES OF 15 ARTICLES ANSWERING PREBLE IN THE REVIEW AND HERALD IN THE WINTER OF 1871-1872.] is an unprincipled, dishonest man. Those who are best acquainted with him have not confidence in him. They will take what he will say, however untrue and unjust and even ridiculous, and make it to bear against the truth if possible. But minds that will receive and be pleased with the productions of his pen are not the ones to be convinced of the truth or that would honor the cause of God, if they should accept the Sabbath. And you are in danger of presenting objections to thousands of minds that they never thought of, and which many will use if they become disaffected.",
