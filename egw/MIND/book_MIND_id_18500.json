    "word": "Purity of life and a character moulded after the divine Pattern are not obtained without earnest effort and fixed principles. A wavering, vacillating mind will not succeed in attaining Christian perfection. Such will be weighed in the balances and found wanting. Satan is seeking for his prey like a roaring lion. He will try his wiles upon every unsuspecting youth, and there is no safety any where only in Christ. It is through his grace alone that Satan can be successfully repulsed. Satan tells the youth there is time enough yet; that they may indulge in sin and vice this once, and never again; but \n                                                                           29\nthat one indulgence will poison your whole life.",
