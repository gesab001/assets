    "word": "Christ is the light of the world. He says, \"He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness.\" \"He that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.\" \"The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.\" Those who follow Christ shall not walk in darkness; but all who follow their own ideas, walking contrary to the Word of God, are of the class concerning whom the Lord spoke to the prophet, \"Can two walk together, except they be agreed?\"",
