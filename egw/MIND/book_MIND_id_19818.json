    "word": "The work of education and training should commence with the babyhood of the child; for then the mind is the most impressible, and the lessons given are remembered. Do not let your inclination to shun responsibilities lead you \n\n\n                                    -49- \n\nto neglect the proper discipline of your child. Restrain her; give her much attention; teach her submission in her early years. Do your duty to her patiently and decidedly, with firmness and love. If you allow her to have her own way, and to control you as she has done, you can be of no use to your husband in traveling with him, or visiting the people. Do not let your child grow up gnarled and crooked in character because of your neglect to do your duty.--Letter 1, 1877, pp. 2, 3. (To Brother and Sister _____, December 17, 1877.)",
