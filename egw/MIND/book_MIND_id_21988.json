    "word": "The greatest work is before us. Our peril, which threatens our usefulness and which will prove our ruin if not seen and overcome, is selfishness--placing a higher estimate upon our plans and our opinions and our labors, and moving independently of our brethren. \"Counsel together,\" have been the words repeated by the angels again and again. Satan may move through one man's mind to warp things out of their proper channel; he may succeed with two who view things in a similar light; but with several minds enlisted there is greater safety. Every plan will be more liable to be criticized and viewed from all sides. Every advance will be more carefully studied, so that no enterprise will be entered into which will bring confusion and perplexity and defeat to the work in which we are engaged. In union \n\n\n                                     -186- \n\nthere is strength; in division there is weakness and defeat.",
