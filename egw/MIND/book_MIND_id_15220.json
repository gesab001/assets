    "word": "I ask myself the question, \"How is it possible for men who are opening the Scriptures to others--men who have abundance of light--men who have good ability--men who are living in the face of the judgment, upon the very borders of the eternal world--to give their thoughts and bodies to unholy practices? Well may the words of the apostle be repeated with emphasis: \"Cleanse your hands, ye sinners: and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He shall lift you up\" (James 4:8-10).-- Letter 51, 1886.",
