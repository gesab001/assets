    "word": "I have been shown that all who now occupy important positions in the Review Office will be tested. If they will make Christ their pattern, he will give them wisdom and knowledge and understanding; they will grow in grace and aptitude in Christ's way; their characters will be molded after his similitude. If they fail to keep the way of the Lord, another spirit will control the mind and judgment, and they will devise plans without the Lord, and will take their own course, and leave the positions they have occupied. The light has been given them; if they depart from it, and follow their own course, let no man present a bribe to induce them to remain. They will be a hindrance and a snare. The time has come when everything is to be shaken that can be shaken, that those things that can not be shaken may remain. Every case is coming in review before God; for he is measuring the temple of God, and the worshipers therein. \"These things, saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; I know thy works. . . . I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast lost thy first love; remember therefore from whence thou art \n                                                                           1117\nfallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove the candlestick out of his place.\" \"Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against thee with the sword of my mouth. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches: To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving him that receiveth it.\"",
