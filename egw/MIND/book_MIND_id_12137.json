    "word": "IN EZEKIEL 9:4 AND REVELATION 7:2,3, THE MARK OR SIGN IS SAID TO  BE PLACED IN THE FOREHEADS OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD. BOTH THESE SCRIPTURES REFER TO A TIME WHEN UTTER DESTRUCTION IS COMING ON THE UNGODLY. THE SEAL IS PLACED UPON GOD'S PEOPLE AS A SAFEGUARD TO PRESERVE THEM FROM THE EVIL IMPENDING. BUT \"THE FOREHEAD\" IS EVIDENTLY USED AS A FIGURE, TO DENOTE THE INTELLECT OR MIND, AS \"THE HEART\" IS USED TO DENOTE THE DISPOSITION OR AFFECTIONS. TO MARK OR SEAL IN THE FOREHEAD IS THE SAME AS TO \"WRITE IN THE MIND.\" HEBREWS 10:16.",
