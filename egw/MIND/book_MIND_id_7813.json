    "word": "Chap. 37 - Principles of Study and Learning\n\n\n     The Mind and Affections Must Be Trained.--God has given reason, the mental faculties of the mind; but if left to themselves uneducated and untrained, they leave man as is revealed in the fierce heathen. The mind and affections require education and direction by teachers. It must be line upon line, and precept upon precept, to guide and train the human moral agent to work in cooperation with God. God works in the human agent by the light of His truth. The mind enlightened by the truth, sees truth in distinction from error.--Lt 135, 1898.",
