    "word": "This matter has been opened before me. There are many minds that are hopelessly wrecked. The beautiful girl just entering womanhood, of whom I have spoken, is, I fear, hopelessly ruined, both in physical and mental health, so that she has had a partial shock of palsy. She was encouraged in her course of reading by the story books and papers found on their own tables at home. Notwithstanding all the pure, elevating influences of home, her parents fully in the truth, the daughter is, I fear, hopelessly lost to the truth and ruined in health and in mind. This appetite was cultivated by the parents. Now the mother writes me in mournful strains, she knows not what to do for her daughter. She has no desire to attend meetings, although she has professed to be a Christian. She wants to do nothing but read, read story books. And it all comes from these good, fictitious novels. While answering the mother's piteous appeal to me for help, your address was placed in my hands, and when I read that paragraph which I have quoted, I felt a burden, a weight upon me; I felt like weeping aloud. I shall meet this statement, and shall have to answer to it.",
