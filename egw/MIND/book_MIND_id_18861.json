    "word": "These families, united as they are by marriage, mingling in each other's society, are awake to the faults and errors of each other, and feel in duty bound to correct them; and because these relatives are really dear to each other, they are grieved over little things that they would not notice in those not as closely connected. Keen sufferings of mind are endured, because feelings will arise with some, that they have not been treated impartially, and with all that consideration they deserved. Petty jealousies sometimes arise, and molehills become mountains. These little misunderstandings, and petty variances, cause severer suffering of mind than trials that come from other sources.",
