    "word": "Seek Opportunities in the Neighborhood.-- Opportunities are within the reach of everyone. Take up the work that should be done in your neighborhood, for which you are held responsible. [NOTE: FOR DETAILED COUNSEL ON THE METHODS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF NEIGHBORHOOD MINISTRY OF KINDNESS, SEE WELFARE MINISTRY.--COMPILERS.] Wait not for others to urge you to take advance steps. Move without delay, bearing in mind your individual responsibility to Him who gave His life for you. Move as if you heard Christ calling upon you personally to awake out of sleep and to exert every God-given faculty in doing the utmost in His service. Look not to see who else is ready to catch inspiration from the word of the living God. If you are thoroughly consecrated, through your instrumentality He will bring into the truth others whom He can use as channels to convey light to many souls in darkness.",
