    "word": "MR No. 1524 - Exercising Faith and Rejoicing in the Lord in Spite of Pain and Suffering\n\n     (Diary entries written in 1892 at Preston, Victoria, Australia. Large portions of this manuscript appear in various Manuscript Releases; Selected Messages, book 2; This Day With God; Sons and Daughters of God; and Mind, Character, and Personality, vol. 2.) \n\n\n     I am deeply grieved as I see that those now in positions of trust in our work do not think of the sacrifices made in the past to establish the work in its various branches. It hurts me to see these new workers, who have made few sacrifices and borne few burdens, demanding the highest wages. They know nothing of what it has cost to bring the work to its present condition; and I can see that in my dealings with them I need not expect any consideration. Their actions have been so harsh and unfeeling that I am led to understand better the word of the Lord to me that I must lean upon His arm, that He will be to me a God and a Father.",
