THIS ARTICLE,\nPAGES 9-12.]\n\n         Reasons for Inefficiency, and the Remedy \n\n                        Melbourne, Australia, July 3, 1892. \n\n\n     I would address those who preach the word: \"The entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\" All the advantages and privileges that may be multiplied for your benefit, that you should be educated and trained, rooted and grounded in the truth, will be no real help to you personally unless the mind and heart are opened so that truth shall find entrance, and you make a conscientious surrender of every habit and practice, and every sin that has closed the door against Jesus. Let the light from Christ search every dark corner of the soul; with earnest determination adopt a right course of action. If you hold onto a wrong course, as many of you are now doing; if the truth does not work in you with transforming power, so that you obey it from the heart because you love its pure principles; be sure that for you the truth will lose its vitalizing power, and sin will strengthen.",
