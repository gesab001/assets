    "word": "In the daily life we are to follow Christ's example. Then into the religious life will come the peace that passes understanding. We are not to engage in any employment or enterprise to gain the praise or honor of men. We are not to speak one word or do one action that will lower in the minds of others the ideal they have of the One who died a death of shame on the cross that He might purchase the privilege of saving His enemies.--Letter 196, Sept. 18, 1901, to an administrator at the St. Helena Sanitarium.",
