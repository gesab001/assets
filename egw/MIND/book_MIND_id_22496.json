    "word": "There have been misstatements of messengers and of the messages they bring. How dare you do this? Ridicule and witticisms are poor arguments. Ridicule cheapens the mind of anyone who engages in it, for it separates his soul from God. No confidence should be placed in the judgment of those who do this thing, no weight attached to their advice or resolutions. Caviling and criticism are not in God's order. . . .",
