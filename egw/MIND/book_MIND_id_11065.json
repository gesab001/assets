A Confederacy of Satan's Forces.--[Revelation 17:13, 14 quoted.] \"These have one mind.\" There will be a universal bond of union, one great harmony, a confederacy of Satan's forces. \"And shall give their power and strength unto the beast.\" Thus is manifested the same arbitrary, oppressive power against religious liberty, freedom to worship God according to the dictates of conscience, as was manifested by the papacy, when in the past it persecuted those who dared to refuse to conform with the religious rites and ceremonies of Romanism.",
