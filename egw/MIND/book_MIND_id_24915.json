    "word": "\"For years I have been instructed that there is danger, constant danger, that our brethren will look to their fellow men for permission to do this or that, instead of looking to God. Thus they become weaklings, and permit themselves to be bound about with man-made restrictions disapproved by God. The Lord can impress minds and conscience to do his work under bonds to God, and in a spirit of fraternity that will be in accordance with his law. . . .",
