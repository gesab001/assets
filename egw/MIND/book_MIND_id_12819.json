    "word": "My labor has been most discouraging, as I have seen that what God designed has not been accomplished. Often I have inquired in distress: Of what account is all my labor? These brethren took this position: We believe the visions, but Sister White, in writing them, put in her own words, and we will believe that portion which we think is of God, and will not heed the other. This course they have pursued, and have not corrected their lives. They have professed to believe the visions, but have acted contrary to them. Their example and influence have raised doubts in the minds of others. It would have been better for the cause of present truth had they both opposed the gifts. Then the people would not have been deceived, and would not have stumbled over these blind teachers. We have hoped and prayed that they might get right, and exert a good influence upon the flock; but hope has died, and we cannot, dare not, hold our peace longer. We have wronged the church of God, in that we have not spoken out before. \n\n                                               -",
