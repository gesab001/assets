    "word": "God requires much more of the men at the head of the work than they give Him. Some give Him long sermons, but this He does not require. Workers are needed just now who will explain the word of God in its simplicity. There is a fearful deception upon human minds. Even those who hold positions of trust are not all faithful. But do not allow yourselves to sleep. The light of truth must go forth as a lamp that burneth.",
