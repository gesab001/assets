    "word": "We cannot wait until the judgment before we consent to deny self and to lift the cross. We cannot then form characters for heaven. It is here in this life that we must take sides with the humble, self-denying Redeemer. It is here that we must overcome envy, strife, selfishness, love of money, and love of the world. It is here that we must enter the school of Christ, and learn of the Master the precious lessons of meekness and lowliness of mind. And here it must be our aim and earnest effort to be loyal and true to the God of heaven by obeying all of His commandments and thus be fitting up for the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for all who love God. Christ says, \"Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me: In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. . . that where I am, there ye may be also\" [John 14:1-3]. Now the mansions are being fitted up in heaven. Are we being fitted with pure elevated holy characters for those mansions?",
