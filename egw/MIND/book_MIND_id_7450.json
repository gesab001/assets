    "word": "Meeting the Tempter's Challenge.--Satan will come to you saying, You are a sinner. But do not let him fill your mind with the thought that because you are sinful, God has cast you off. Say to him, Yes, I am a sinner, and for that reason I need a Saviour. I need forgiveness and pardon, and Christ says that if I come to Him I shall not perish. In His letter to me I read, \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9). I will believe the word He has left for me. I will obey His commands. When Satan tells you that you are lost, answer, Yes, but Jesus came to seek and to save that which was lost. The greater my sin, the greater my need of a Saviour.--Lt 98b, 1896.",
