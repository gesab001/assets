    "word": "If you had taken hold of your Sabbath history and made that your principal, but not your exclusive, business, and labored a portion of the time to keep up other branches of the work, it would have been better for you, and better for the interests of the cause of God. You love just the kind of work you are now doing; but while you are going so thorough, and covering so much ground, you are not getting out a work calculated to do the greatest amount of good, by awakening a general interest. Minds become weary in reading and following you. When you get engaged in matter that you are now at work upon, you scarcely know where to stop.",
