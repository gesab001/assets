    "word": "Cultivate a prayerful frame of mind and educate the tongue to speak right words, that will bless in the place of discouraging. . . . Talk of the goodness, the mercy, and the love of God. Put away all unbelieving words and all that is cheap and common. Let the words be sound words, that cannot be condemned, and the peace of God will surely come to the soul.",
