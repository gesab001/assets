    "word": "The instructors may do a greater work than they have hitherto calculated upon. Minds are to be molded and character developed by interested experiment, \n\n\n                                    -221- \n\nwhich, by the help of Christ, will prove wholly successful. Let your work be blended with prayer and faith that God will honor your efforts. In the fear of God encourage and strengthen every endeavor to develop the highest faculties, even if it is marked with great imperfection.",
