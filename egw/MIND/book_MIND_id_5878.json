    "word": "God demands the improvement of every faculty he has given to man. Those who possess superior intellectual powers are thus placed under greater responsibility, and if this gift is so perverted as to make the possessor \n286\nforgetful of God and his claims, if he employs it to lead the minds of others away from God, he will have a fearful account to render in that day when every man shall receive according to his deeds. Every talent put to a wrong use is entered as robbery in the books of heaven.",
