    "word": "Plain Presentation of Truth--Everywhere there are hearts crying out for the living God. Discourses unsatisfying to the hungry soul have been given in the churches. In these discourses there is not that divine manifestation which touches the mind and creates a glow in the soul. The hearers cannot say: \"Did not our heart burn within us, while He talked \n                                                                           320\nwith us by the way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures?\" Luke 24:32. Much of the teaching given is powerless to awaken the transgressor or convict souls of sin. The people who come to hear the Word need a plain, straightforward presentation of truth.--6T 53.",
