    "word": "Christianity at the present day should not be fainter in luster and feebler in power than in past ages. We must not be void of faith now. There are tremendous responsibilities that the ministers of Jesus Christ must carry if they are conscious of their appointed work--to watch for souls as they that must give an account. Feed the flock of God, and while you are bearing daily responsibilities in the love and fear of God, as obedient children walking in all humility of mind, strength and wisdom from God will be given to meet every trying circumstance.",
