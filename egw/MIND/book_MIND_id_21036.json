    "word": "MR No. 1089 - Choose Counselors Who Are Guided by the Holy Spirit\n\n   (Written July 2, 1901, to R. M. Kilgore, from St. Helena, California.) \n\n\n     You are represented to me as walking in mist and fog, your arm linked in the arm of Brother Y. I can write only a few words today, but I wish to say that unless you are freed from the influence of Brother Y, you will voice his sentiments, to the injury of the cause of God. You are not to accept his ideas, for he is not being educated by the Holy Spirit. Why do you allow your mind to be confused by those who are not walking in the light? Why do you not do as the Lord has signified you should do--stand by the work in the South?",
