    "word": "It is not the will of God that the mould of Elder Daniels should be upon the church in Fresno, for it would not be mould of Christ. He is not a man whose influence would be permanent. God would have his people in every Conference look to him, and him alone, and not make flesh their arm. He whose eyes are \"as a flame of fire\" is searching every church in the world. His gaze is piercing every heart. He is measuring the temple and the worshipers thereof, weighing all their actions in the golden scales of heaven, and registering the result in the books of record. All things are open to the eye of Him with whom we have to do. He is a \"discerner of the thoughts and intents and purposes of the heart.\" No deed of darkness can be screened from his view. Sin, undetected by man, unsuspected by human minds, is noted and registered by the great Heart searcher. \n\n\n                              [3]",
