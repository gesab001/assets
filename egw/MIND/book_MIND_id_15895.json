    "word": "Satan will bring in pleasing fables to meet the minds of all who love not the truth. With angry zeal he will accuse commandment keepers. . . . Satan claims the world, but there is a little company who withstand his devices and contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. Satan sets himself to destroy this  commandment-keeping company. But God is their tower of defense. He will raise up for them a standard against the enemy. He will be to them \"as an hiding place from the wind,\" and \"as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land\" (Isaiah 32:2). He will say to them, \"Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain\" (Isaiah 26:20, 21). \"And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away\" (Isaiah 35:10).",
