    "word": "The love of Christ should be cherished. More faith is needed in the work which we believe is to be done before the coming of Christ. There should be more self-denying, self-sacrificing labor in the right direction. There should be thoughtful, prayerful study how to work to the best advantage. Careful plans should be matured. There are minds among us that can invent and carry out, if they are only put to use. Great results would follow well-directed and intelligent efforts.\u2014T., vol. 4, pp. 69, 70.",
