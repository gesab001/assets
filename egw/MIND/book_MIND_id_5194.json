    "word": "Like God's servants of old, many were \u201ctortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.\u201d [Hebrews 11:35.] These called to mind the words of their Master, that when persecuted for Christ's sake they were to be exceeding glad; for great would be their reward in Heaven; for so the prophets had been persecuted before them. They rejoiced that they were accounted worthy to suffer for the truth, and songs of triumph ascended from the midst of crackling flames. Looking upward by faith, they saw Christ and angels leaning over the battlements of Heaven, gazing upon them with the deepest interest, and regarding their steadfastness with approval. A voice came down to them from the throne of God, \u201cBe thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\u201d [Revelation 2:10.]",
