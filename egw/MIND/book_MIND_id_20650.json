    "word": "Sound Constitutions Needed--No one can submerge his identity in another. He must know himself, and give himself a favorable chance to come forth with an unbroken constitution, with a clear mind, with well-balanced nerves, and a good digestion. With these, he will be fitted to do the work he has qualified himself to do. If he disqualifies himself by imprudence, by eating hurriedly, because he has little time to spend, he is unfitting himself for ever doing sound, wholesome work.",
