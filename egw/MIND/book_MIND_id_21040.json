    "word": "For a long time before the first advent of Christ, the rabbis had been working to make the truth of none effect. They seemed to have lost their common sense, and they labored to construct something original to preserve their influence. They made a show of victory [i.e., superiority or supremacy] by an endless repetition of fables and childish traditions. They manufactured cheap, inconsistent, frivolous sayings and trivial forms, construing the truth into falsehood. Their minds became darkened. Unpracticed, the sacred truths lost their lustre. Fabrications were made up, unnecessary duties enjoined, false tests made and presented. Sacred truth was dishonored by being brought into companionship with error.",
