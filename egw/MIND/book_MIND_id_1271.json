    "word": "In the summer of 1853 we made our first visit to Michigan. Soon after our return to Rochester, New York, my husband engaged in writing the book \"Signs of the Times.\" He was still feeble, and could sleep but little, but the Lord was his support. When his mind was in a confused, suffering state, we would bow before God, and in our distress cry unto Him. He heard our earnest prayers, and often blessed my husband so that with refreshed spirits he went on with the work. Many times in the day did we thus go before the Lord in earnest prayer. That book was not written in his own strength.",
