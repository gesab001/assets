    "word": "While your wife is making up her mind what she will do, Satan has decided what he will do in order to carry out his purposes. He is seeking a door by \n\n\n                                    -265- \n\nwhich he can enter your mind and take possession of it, to make of it a workshop for himself. If your wife repents and is converted, if in contrition of heart she asks for pardon for her estrangement from God, and as a little child bows in submission before Him, He will receive her and bless her. But repentance must come before conversion can take place. I tremble for her and for you. Unless she is converted, soul, body, and spirit, Satan will use her as his helping hand to mislead others.",
