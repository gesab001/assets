    "word": "These brain-workers have as much interest in the cause of God as those who compose the Board, which is willing to be conscience for them. Some of these have had a connection with the work almost from its infancy. God has not placed upon this Board the work of being conscience for others. They should not seek so persistently to force men to their terms. The policy plan is not to be classed with discretion; although it is too often mistaken for this. It is a species of selfishness in whatever cause it is exercised, and stops at nothing which promises success: but discretion uses judgment, and is never narrow in its workings, and has broad ideas, and the eye of the mind is capable of taking in more than one object, and views questions from all sides. While policy has a short range of vision, seeing every object near at hand, but failing to discover those at a distance. It is ever watching to obtain advantages which do not belong to it; and would build itself up by pulling out the foundation from another's building.",
