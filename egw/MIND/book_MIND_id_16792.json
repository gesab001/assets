    "word": "There are a class of people who are always ready to go off on some tangent, who want to catch up something strange and wonderful and new; but God would have all [of us] move calmly, considerately choosing our words in harmony with the solid truth for this time, which requires [that it] be presented to the mind as free from that which is emotional as possible, while still bearing the intensity and solemnity that it is proper it should bear. We must guard against creating extremes, guard against encouraging those who would be either in the fire or in the water.--Lt 37, 1894.",
