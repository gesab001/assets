    "word": "There has been merchandise carried on in our institutions. Why have my brethren upheld and sanctioned wrong? Why have they allowed their judgments to be controlled by those who neither fear God nor regard man? Why have their principles of right and justice been swayed and guided by another mind in matters of conscience? They may think it a better mind and a better judgment, but they are not to exchange their judgment for that of another man. Place your will and mind where the Holy Spirit can reach it, for it will not work on another man's mind and conscience to reach yours. But those whom it was thought had pure religious principles have shown themselves too ready to give up their own religion for that of another man.",
