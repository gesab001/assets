    "word": "In the open air the patients, some in wheelchairs, will feel songs of joy coming from their hearts, and some will receive Christ by faith. Many more might be brought to a knowledge of the truth if their surroundings were of a softening and subduing nature. As they behold the beauties of nature, their minds will be led to think of the glories of the home that Christ has gone to prepare for His people. They will realize that the Bible has been given to point out the way to this home, and to prepare the soul for the region of bliss. Joy unspeakable will fill their minds.--Ms 115, 1903, pp. 1,2,6-8.
