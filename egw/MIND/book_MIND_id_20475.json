    "word": "\"They overcame him,\" we read, \"by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony\" (Revelation 12:11). You may bear a testimony the opposite to that which Satan would have you bear. You may keep heart and mind sanctified by obedience to the truth. Look to Him, in the morning and at noon, and at night. Keep heart and mind fastened upon Christ. This is your privilege. The suffering and death of Christ has paid the price for your redemption, and through faith in Him you may overcome.--Manuscript 79, 1909, pp. 1-3.
