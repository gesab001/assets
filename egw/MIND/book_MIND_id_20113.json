    "word": "The work must not be hindered as it has been and God's people discouraged by the undue exercise of human authority. These words of the apostle clearly reveal that there is given to God's servants a special work, \n\n\n                                    -405- \n\nto be done as the Spirit of God shall impress the heart and mind of the individual. All have not the same form of work to do. Let the workers lift the voice of rebuke against presumptuous rulership over God's heritage. We are safe only when we individually commit ourselves fully to works of righteousness. Then all, church members, and men of the world, will know where we stand. Our words and spirit will testify to the glory of God.",
