    "word": "The world accepts the theories of men, the science that is put forth. A vast number are skeptical when God speaks from His Word, but there is in this period of history great credulity when some learned man speaks. The power of human minds giving explanations of science is so marvelously increasing in these last days that man is seeking to find a natural cause for everything he sees and hears. This false science is termed higher education, and men are lifted up in their own human importance, extolling their own natural abilities, full of all they see and hear.",
