    "word": "This day was not without its trials. There is a sense of exhaustion. I try to leave my case in the hands of God. I keep my mind in a praying, supplicating position that the Lord will impart to me His own Holy Spirit, for I know that without His special help I shall not be able to speak to the people. . . . I have not been able to speak nights without paying the penalty in a sleepless night.",
