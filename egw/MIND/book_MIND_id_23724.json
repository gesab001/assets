    "word": "Self-abasement is highly appropriate for all who handle sacred things in Battle Creek. Self is to be abased, not now and then, but continually. God has commanded you to put sacred fire upon your censors, but you have used common fire altogether too much. There are men who, if God allowed it, would assume absolute control over the mind and conscience of their fellow-men, though they know not by experience what self-control is. The Lord may forgive your iniquity, and O, if the Lord will in his great mercy turn his face toward you, appreciate his love as you have never done before. In proportion as you, who stand as guardians of faith and trust, have correct views of God and his holiness and glory, your fear to offend him will increase. This is positively essential before you can be where God can impress your minds by giving you views of himself.",
