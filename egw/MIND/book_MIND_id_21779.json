    "word": "Why were the eyes of the people blinded, and their hearts hardened? As they listened to Christ's words and witnessed His miracles, they were convinced of His divinity. The Spirit of God impressed their hearts, leading them to say, This is indeed the Messiah, the One for whom we have looked, the Desire of all nations. But they hardened their hearts, and refused to accept Him. To a great degree, the priests and rulers were responsible for the people turning away from the truth to the maxims of men. And today the preachers of the people are following the footsteps of the priests and elders of the Jewish nation. When conviction is trampled on, the light that has shone into the chambers of the mind grows dim, and the darkness of error takes the place of the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. The result of this is shown in the following verses: [Jeremiah 13:15-17, 20, 21, 23-25;  10:19-21, quoted].",
