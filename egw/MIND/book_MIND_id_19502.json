    "word": "God presents to you His will and ways which are in marked contrast, in just that way which your case requires, and you are hereby tested whether you will accept the reproof, fall on the Rock and be broken, or will you become vexed over plain statements that come close to your souls; because it is the truth and condemns you, and then you feel at enmity with me. Hebrews 4:12. There is One back of me which is the Lord, who has prompted the message which you \n\n\n                                    -63- \n\nnow reject and disregard and dishonor.
