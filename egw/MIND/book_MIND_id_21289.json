    "word": "Every organ has its function, and our Creator has pledged Himself to keep our organs in a healthful condition if we will obey the laws implanted in our nature. The laws governing the physical nature are as truly divine in their origin and character as the laws of the ten commandments. Man is fearfully and wonderfully made; for Jehovah has inscribed His law by His own mighty hand on every part of the physical structure. Many are sick who might be well if they would but cooperate with God, surrendering soul, body, and spirit to His control. For in order to have health, we must keep ourselves in harmony with God's law. To have clean hands and a pure heart is to have peace and contentment of mind, and this is conducive to health.",
