    "word": "MR No. 962 - The Value of Pictures in Educating Children\n\n     Edson, your method of instructing from pictures for the Southern school is an excellent idea. These pictures can be got up as cheaply as possible. You might talk till you were weary to get ideas into the heads of the colored [or any] children, but give them a similitude, an object, and the lesson becomes stamped upon the mind never to be forgotten. This is why the Gospel Primer has been and will continue to be effective.--Letter 136a, 1898, p. 9. (To Edson White, Aug. 14, 1898.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. January 6, 1983",
