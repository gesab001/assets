    "word": "Though the mind may wander in prayer, be not discouraged; bring it back to the throne and do not leave the mercy seat until you have the victory. Are you to think your victory will be testified by strong emotion? No, \"This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\" The Lord knows your desire.

The Father hath given His Son for us, that through the Son the Holy Spirit might come to us and lead us to the Father. Through His divine agency we have the spirit of intercession whereby we may plead with God as a man pleadeth with his friend.--Letter 11b, 1892, pp. 3-6. (To S. N. Haskell, July 17, 1892.) \n\n\n                                      -38-",
