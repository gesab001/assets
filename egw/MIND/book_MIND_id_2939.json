    "word": "Never should books containing a perversion of truth be placed in the hands of children or youth. Let not our children, in the very process of obtaining an education, receive ideas that will prove to be seeds of sin. If those with mature minds had nothing to do with such books, they would themselves be far safer, and their example and influence on the right side would make it far less difficult to guard the youth from temptation. \n\n\n                   A Purer Fountain \n\n\"Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, \n And apply thine heart unto My knowledge. . . . \n That thy trust may be in the Lord, \n I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. \n\n\"Have I not written to thee excellent things \n In counsels and knowledge, \n That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of \n     truth; \n That thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send \n     unto thee?\" Proverbs 22:17-21. \n\n\"He established a testimony in Jacob, \n And appointed a law in Israel, \n Which He commanded our fathers, \n That they should make them known to their children;\" \n\n\"Showing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, \n And His strength, and His wonderful works that He hath done.\" \n\"That the generation to come might know them, \n Even the children which should be born; \n Who should arise and declare them to their children: \n That they might set their hope in God.:\" Psalm 78:4-7. \n\n\"The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, \n And He addeth no sorrow with it.\" Proverbs 10:22.",
