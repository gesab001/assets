    "word": "There are lessons the practitioners at the Sanitarium would do well to learn upon these things. You are not called upon to exaggerate difficulties and express alarm that will do harm; but never turn away from suffering, even if you think it is imaginary. Mind suffering \n\n\n                          -29- \n\nis a reality to the afflicted one. Go to work to do something. Show a tender regard, a human sympathy, for the one afflicted. If this is beyond your power, cease your practice as physician, and take up some other calling, where your stoical spirit and temperament will not have so direct an influence upon others, where you will not come in so close relationship to suffering humanity.",
