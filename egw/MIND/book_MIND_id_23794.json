    "word": "There has come into the California Conference a spirit of judgment, an inclination to draw apart. There are some who unless things appear right to their human judgment, draw apart from their ministering brethren. Thus God is dishonored. You think you see danger that may be at some time, and you speak words of criticism, sowing seeds which like mustard seeds become great trees. Give your mind up to unifying rather than to drawing apart. God desires this criticism, which produces tares resembling wheat, to be entirely done away. \n                                                                           1761",
