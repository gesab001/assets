    "word": "When the mind has thus become confused, when right is considered to be unessential, when wrong is not termed sin, then it is an impossibility to dislodge the enemy, or to make these deceived souls feel that it is the adversary that has confused the senses and polluted the soul temple. Where truth should be unadulterated, is a tissue of lies. The word of God is a dead letter, the love of the Saviour is not there, the first foundation for the building is on sliding sand, there is not one heavenly impulse in the soul, religion is a dead form, God is not in such men's thoughts. There is no vitality and vigor from an inward religious life, for the soul is not in harmony with God.",
