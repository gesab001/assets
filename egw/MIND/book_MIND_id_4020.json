    "word": "Now not a soul can give God anything that is not already His. Bear this in mind: \"All things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee\" (1 Chronicles 29:14). This must be kept before the people wherever we go--that we possess nothing, can offer nothing in value, in work, in faith, which we have not first received of God and upon which He can lay His hand any time and say, They are Mine--gifts and blessings and endowments I entrusted to you, not to enrich yourself, but for wise improvement to benefit the world.",
