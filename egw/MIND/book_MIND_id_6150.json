    "word": "You have had an opportunity to show whether your religion was a practical reality. You have taken liberties in the sight of God and holy angels that you would not take under the observation of your fellow men.

You may take these lessons home. You have need to learn, and may God help you. \n\n\n                                                Ellen G.
