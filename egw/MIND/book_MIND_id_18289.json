    "word": "J. H. MORRISON--I FEEL THAT IN WHAT BROTHER JONES HAS READ HERE TONIGHT THERE ARE RAYS OF LIGHT, AND WE ARE CONDEMNED AND GUILTY, AND WE WOULD BETTER BE CONFESSING OUR GUILT THAN TRYING TO DEFEND OURSELVES, EVEN THOUGH WE MAY ACTUALLY THINK WE ARE RIGHT. I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN THE TESTIMONY COMES SO PLAINLY IN REFERENCE TO THE STATE OF THINGS HERE. IF WE DO NOT SEE IT, IT SEEMS TO ME IT OUGHT TO BRING US TO THE PLACE WHERE WE WILL LOOK CAREFULLY AND PRAYERFULLY AT THE MATTER, AND BEGIN TO LOOK TO SEE IF THERE ARE THESE WRONGS THAT WE CAN DISCOVER, AND GET RID OF THEM; BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE LORD IS AT WORK, AND WANTING TO DO SOMETHING FOR US NOW. WHEN WE GET IN THE ATTITUDE OF DEFENSE, WE ARE NOT IN THE PLACE WHERE OUR MINDS ARE OPEN TO RECEIVE LIGHT. THAT IS THE DANGER. EVEN THOUGH I CAN NOT SEE IT, I DO NOT BELIEVE I WOULD BETTER PUT IN A DEFENSE; BECAUSE THEN WHEN I AM IN A PLACE WHERE THERE IS LIGHT, I AM NOT PREPARED TO RECEIVE THAT LIGHT.",
