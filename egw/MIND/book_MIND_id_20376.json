    "word": "MR No. 738 - Christ's Human Nature in Gethsemane\n\n     We naturally long for sympathy and fellowship in suffering, and Christ felt this longing to the depths of His being when in His trial in Gethsemane He asked His disciples to watch with Him. But even they did not witness his great agony. He fought out His soul-battle alone, for when He came to see His disciples He found them sleeping. Sorrowfully He asked, \"What, could ye not watch with Me one hour?\" (Matthew 26:40). Christ poured out His soul to God in an agony which He was not ashamed for His disciples to witness. They would ever afterwards call to mind that scene in Gethsemane, when their Lord bent over them, His face all marred with the bloody sweat which was caused by the agony He was enduring.",
