    "word": "The mind cannot conceive, nor the tongue express, the depths to which it is possible for the stubborn, jealous soul to sink, who rejects light and refuses all entreaties, all warnings, all prayers. Oh, how needful that we all pray for Christian consistency. We are in the world, living among people whose eyes are shut to light, whose ears are open to hear all that is possible of the faults and errors of those who claim to believe the truth. Give no occasion for the devil to gain the victory. All hell triumphs when you do. Oh, how earnestly we should strive and pray that the hateful temper, the stubborn will, shall be brought into submission to God. Watching unto prayer will save many souls. If our words and tempers are sanctified, we shall adorn the doctrine of Christ our Saviour. If our brethren conduct themselves as saints of the most high God, if they show under every test that they have faith in him whom they profess to serve, if they are not easily provoked, they will be witnesses for Christ Those who are by faith children of Abraham, have a high calling, and they have an example that is in accordance with their light and privileges. They trust in Him whose day Abraham saw afar off. \n                                                                           1662",
