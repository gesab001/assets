    "word": "When it appeared to Luther that all was lost, God raised up a friend and helper for him. The pious Staupitz opened the word of God to Luther's mind, and bade him look away from himself, cease the contemplation of infinite punishment for the violation of God's law, and look to Jesus, his sin-pardoning Saviour. \"Instead of torturing yourself on account of your sins, cast yourself into the arms of your Redeemer. Trust in him,--in the righteousness of his life,--in the atonement of his death. Listen to the Son of God. He became man to give you the assurance of divine favor. Love him who has first loved you.\" Thus spoke this messenger of mercy. His words made a deep impression upon Luther's mind. After many a struggle with long-cherished errors, he was enabled to grasp the truth, and peace came to his troubled soul.",
