    "word": "The only safe course to pursue is to search the heart, try the motives by the Word of God, and test the spirit, and see what is the influence of words and actions. Conversion is needed. A transforming influence of the Spirit of God upon the character must be felt and demonstrated in the words and actions. There are very many who are copying the spirit of Sister Graham. This spirit is certainly not the Spirit of Christ. If her eyes could be turned inwardly and she could see how offensive is this spirit in the sight of God, she would make determined efforts to sit at the feet of \n\n\n                                    -289- \n\nJesus and, like Mary, learn of the Master meekness and lowliness of mind. She would be a learner in the school of Christ rather than a teacher. We cannot with safety look away from our Saviour for one moment, for a dart of Satan will be hurled at our weakest points. In the exercise of a living faith in the merits of Christ alone are we safe. The helpless soul of the sinner must hang on Jesus. If he lets go his hold for one moment, he is in imminent peril of hurting his own soul and of imperiling the souls of others.",
