    "word": "Satan has turned men from the worship of the true Sabbath, which at the creation of the world God sanctified and blessed, and which on Mt. Sinai He repeated amid terrible majesty to His people. All who reject the sacred message regarding the requirements of the law of God, reject truth. God's obedient people are to hold fast to truth in every line. This is the only hope of the soul when Satan seeks to take control of heart and mind.",
