Our minds and bodies must be subordinated to him; and the natural habits and appetites must be made subservient to the higher wants of the soul. But we can place no dependence upon ourselves in this work. We cannot with safety follow our own guidance. The Holy Spirit must renew and sanctify us. In God's service there must be no half-way work. Those who profess to serve God, and yet indulge their natural impulses, will mislead other souls. Said Christ, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind. . . . This do, and thou shalt live.\"",
