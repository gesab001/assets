    "word": "Unity in Diversity--The Lord endows His workers with power. By the influence of this power they are fitted to be wise directors and teachers, each doing his appointed work. Then the truth goes forth as a lamp that burneth. But God does not design that the teachers of truth shall each be strong on one point. There is to be unity in diversity. Every one is to be earnest in endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace. One man's thought is not to control, but minds are to be united \n\n\n                                  -179- \n\nunder the great Head, as the branches are united to the vine. Believers in the Saviour who gave His life for them, they are to work together in harmony. There will be no friction, for they will realize that they are called to the belief and knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. Those who are partakers of the divine nature will be one in spirit with Christ. \"For he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit\" (1 Corinthians 6:17). . . .",
