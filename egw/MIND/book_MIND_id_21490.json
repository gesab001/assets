    "word": "THEY HAVE PRINTED WHAT YOU SAID IN REGARD TO KEEPING FREE FROM DEBT; AND THE PEOPLE HAVE BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE DONE. NOW WHEN IT TURNS OUT THAT SO MUCH HAS BEEN LOST IN EXPENSIVE MANAGEMENT, AND THAT THEY HAVE GONE INTO DEBT NEARLY $25,000 BESIDES, THIS IS HAVING A VERY BAD EFFECT ON THE MINDS OF OUR PEOPLE. I FEEL THAT WE MUST TAKE HOLD OF THIS THING, AND STOP IT, AND PUT IT RIGHT, AND PLACE THE INSTITUTION IN A POSITION WHERE IT WILL NOT CONTINUE TO LOSE IN ITS OPERATION. I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY NEED OF SO HEAVY A LOSS EVERY MONTH.",
