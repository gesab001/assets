    "word": "The wellbeing of our child demands that we reveal the attributes of God in our own character. The child is God's by creation and by redemption. No evil course of action must be sanctioned in that little one; no evil example, in spirit, in word, in action, should be seen in the parents, to be reproduced in the child. So it is on a larger scale with men in sacred trust; they are not to bring their own spirit into their life, they are not to walk by the sparks of their own \n                                                                           1399\nkindling, and act out the peevish disposition of a child because they do not possess self-control. A man in stature should be a man in the development of his God-given talents and ability to be used in the service of God. He should consider that he is not working for himself, but for the benefit of human beings around him. If man is careless and disconnects from Jesus Christ, the source of his strength and efficiency, he works always in Satan's lines in some way. He yields to temptation in accordance with his perverted ideas, and his course of action will be reproduced in his children, and through them in future generations. Then should not men feel the responsibility resting upon them to deal with human minds after the manner that God deals with them? The facts that God has presented in his word should make men afraid of imparting to their offspring their own unsanctified attributes of character. It is for the interest of the children under their guardianship that they live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present evil world.",
