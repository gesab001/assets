    "word": "It is impossible to find a welcome in the denominational churches, and therefore the Lord directed that camp meetings should be held. Thus the third angel's message is to be proclaimed. The Lord has especially endorsed this means of reaching the masses. Thus high and low, rich and poor, free and bond, may be reached. It is a pleasure to see thousands of people sitting as though riveted to their seats, listening with astonishment to the presentation of the truth. To them the Bible is as a new book. Oh, how earnestly they listen, as things new and old are brought forth from the treasury of the Word. Through this work many from the higher as well as the lower classes have received the truth. The Holy Spirit has impressed human minds, and men and women through whom God could work have been brought together in church fellowship.",
