    "word": "Chap. 19 - Physical Exercise as a Remedial Agency\n\n\n     Physical exercise and labor combined have a happy influence upon the mind, strengthen the muscles, improve the circulation, and give the invalid the satisfaction of knowing his own power of endurance; whereas, if he is restricted from healthful exercise and physical labor, his attention is turned to himself. He is in constant danger of thinking himself worse than he really is, and of having established within him a diseased imagination, which causes him continually to fear that he is overtaxing his powers of endurance. As a general thing, if he would engage in some well-directed labor, using his strength and not abusing it, he would find that physical exercise would prove a more powerful and effective agent in his recovery than even the water treatment he is receiving.--\"Testimonies,\" Vol. IV, page 94. \n\n                                               -",
