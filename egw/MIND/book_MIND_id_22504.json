    "word": "Preparation for the Judgment\n\n(Sermon by Mrs. E. G. White, June 27, 1886, Orebro, Sweden.)\n\n     Revelation 20:11-15. Here is presented before us the great and solemn day when the judgment is to set and the books be opened, and the dead are to be judged according to the things that are written in the books. I have questioned in my mind, as I have seen the people in our cities hurrying to and fro with business, whether they ever thought of the day of God that is just upon us. Every one of us should be living with reference to that great day which is soon to come upon us.",
