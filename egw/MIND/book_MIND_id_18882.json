    "word": "Bro. Waggoner has an experience to gain, without which his work will do positive injury. He is affected too much by what others tell him, of the erring, and he is apt to decide according to the impressions made upon his mind, and he deals with severity when a milder course would be far better. He does not bear in mind his own weakness, and how hard it is for him to have his course questioned, even when he is wrong.",
