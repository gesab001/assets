    "word": "Chap. 34 - Conscience\n\n\n     Exalt the Conscience to Its Rightful Place of Authority.--God has given men more than a mere animal life. He \"so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" He expects those for whom He has made so great a sacrifice to show their appreciation of His love by following the example that Christ has set them, living lives that are in harmony with His will. He expects them to respond to the love He has expressed for them by denying self for the good of others. He expects them to use the powers of mind and body in His service. He has given them affections, and He expects them to use this precious gift to His glory. He has given them a conscience, and He forbids that this gift be in any way misused; it is, rather, to be exalted to the place of authority to which He has assigned it.--SW, Mar 1, 1904.",
