    "word": "Wise Parents Will Be Considerate.--\"Should parents,\" you ask, \"select a companion without regard to the mind or feelings of son or daughter?\" I put the question to you as it should be: Should a son or daughter select a companion without first consulting the parents, when such a step must materially affect the happiness of parents if they have any affection for their children? And should that child, notwithstanding the counsel and entreaties of his parents, persist in following his own course? I answer decidedly: No; not if he never marries. The fifth commandment forbids such a course. \"Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\" Here is a commandment with a promise which the Lord will surely fulfill to those who obey. Wise parents will never select companions for their children without respect to their wishes.",
