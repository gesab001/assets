    "word": "Brother Q, time is short, very short, and every true child of God is to be vigilant, wide awake, and not to be found for one moment on the enemy's ground. My brother, you have need to exercise your mind most earnestly to gather with Jesus Christ in order that Satan shall in no case use you to advance his own interest, and you destroy yourself. You may think that you have reason to be angry because you have not been treated properly and justly in the past, and that you will not submit to this restriction or to that.",
