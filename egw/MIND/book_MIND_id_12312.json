    "word": "Chapter XXXVIII. - The Messiah.\n\n     Before Christ left Heaven, and came into the world to die, he was taller than any of the angels. He was majestic and lovely. \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\" He took upon himself man's nature. When his ministry commenced, he was but little taller than the common size of men then living upon the earth. Had he come among men with his noble, heavenly form, his outward appearance would have attracted the minds of the people to himself, and he would have been received without the exercise of faith.",
