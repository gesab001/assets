August 29, 1907 \n\nDear Brother and Sister Burden: \n\n\n     I have been very anxious to learn something of the meetings you have been holding. W. C. White has written us no particulars. I would be glad if you would bear in mind that I am intensely interested in this meeting, and desire to know about it. Has it meant victory or defeat?",
