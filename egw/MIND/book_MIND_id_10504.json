    "word": "Counsel Together--Compare Plans \n\n     In every effort in every place where the truth is introduced there is need of different minds, different gifts, different plans and methods of labor being united. All should make it a point to counsel together, to pray together. Christ says that, \"If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\" (Matthew 18:19). No one worker has all the wisdom that is needed. There should be a comparing of plans, a counseling together. No one man should think himself sufficient to manage an interest in any place without helpers.",
