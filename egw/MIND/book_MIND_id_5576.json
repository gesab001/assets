They shall grow like the cedar, and their comprehension will be certainly increasing. And at every advanced stage of knowledge their anticipation will fall far beneath the reality. \u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him\u201d (1 Corinthians 2:9). Our work now is to prepare for those mansions that God is preparing for those who love Him and keep His commandments. . . . The Lord Jesus will enlarge every mind and heart for the reception of the Holy Spirit.\u2014Letter 71, 1900 quoted in UL 151.",
