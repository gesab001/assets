    "word": "Jesus desires to efface the image of the earthly from the minds of His followers, and to impress upon them the image of the heavenly, that they may become one with Himself, reflecting His character, and showing forth the praises of Him who hath called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. If you have been permitted to stand in the presence of the Sun of Righteousness, it is not that you may absorb and conceal the bright beams of Christ's righteousness, but that you may become a light to others. . . . There are persons who have received the precious light of the righteousness of Christ, but they do not act upon it. . . . They prefer the sophistry of the enemy rather than the plain, \"Thus saith the Lord.\" . . .",
