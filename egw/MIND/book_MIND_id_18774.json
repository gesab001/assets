    "word": "He who has to deal with persons differing so widely in character, disposition, and temperament, will have trials, perplexities, and collisions, even when he does his best. He may be disgusted with the ignorance, pride, and independence which he will meet; but this should not discourage him. He should stand where he will sway, rather than be swayed. Firm as a rock to principle, with an intelligent faith, he should stand uncorrupted by surrounding influences. The physicians and helpers should not be transformed by the various influences to which they must necessarily be exposed; but they must stand up for Jesus, and by the aid of his Spirit exert a transforming power upon minds deformed by false habits and defiled by sin.",
