    "word": "Christ . . . can and will, if we submit to Him, fill the chambers of the mind and the recesses of the soul with His Spirit. Then our will will be in perfect harmony with the Divine will. Our spirit and will may be so identified with His Spirit and will that in thought and aim we shall be one with Him. Then Satan will no longer control us. Christ is our Leader, and His followers love to keep step and step with Him. He speaks, and they obey His voice as one mind and one soul.",
