WHITE FROM 1879-1904, AND ASSISTED HER \n            IN THE PREPARATION OF MANY OF HER MOST IMPORTANT \n            BOOKS.] October 23, 1890 \n\n\n     Dear Marian: It is time that you have a period of entire rest and I hope you will now regard my wishes and take it. While out to your father's, do not try to write or fix manuscript. Just let the mind rest and be free, go anywhere you please, do anything you please and rest. Your wages shall go on just the same. This is my decided wish and then when I am through with this round of meetings, we will go into the preparation of the Life of Christ, fresh and earnest. Will you do it?",
