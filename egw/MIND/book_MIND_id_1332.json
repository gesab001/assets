    "word": "God is Willing to Teach Others--The idea that one man's mind and judgment can mold and direct important interests, and that he can be regarded as a voice for the people, is a great evil, and has, and still continues to endanger the one who is placed in a position of responsibility, and those also who cooperate with him.  God has not given to any one man all the wisdom, and wisdom will not die with him.  Those placed in positions of trust should modestly regard the \n37\nopinions of others as worthy of respect and likely to be as correct as their own.  They should remember that God has made other men just as valuable as they are, and that God is willing to teach and guide these men.--Manuscript 55, 1897 (June 3, 1897, Development of Workers).",
