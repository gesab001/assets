    "word": "He needs the censure of none, but the pity of all. His life has been a terrible mistake. He has suffered imaginary pecuniary want, while surrounded with plenty. Satan has taken possession of his mind, and excited his organ of acquisitiveness, and made him insane upon this subject. The higher, noble powers of his being have been brought very much into subjection to the close, selfish propensity of acquisitiveness. His only hope is in overcoming this propensity, and breaking the bands of Satan. He has tried to do this, by doing something after his conscience had been wrought upon; but this is not sufficient. This merely making a mighty effort and parting with a little of his mammon, and feeling all the time that he is parting with his soul, is not the fruit of true religion. He must train his mind to good works. He must brace against his propensity to acquire. He must weave into all his life good works. He must cultivate a love of doing good, and get above the little, penurious spirit which he has fostered.",
