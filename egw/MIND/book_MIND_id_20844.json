    "word": "Bear in mind that Jesus is afflicted in all our afflictions. He became in our behalf a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. You are being brought into profound sympathy with the fellowship of the sufferings of Christ as you are partaking of His sufferings. You will be sharers of His glory, which will be revealed. Let the grasp of your faith become more firm, and the measure of your love for Jesus deeper and more abiding.",
