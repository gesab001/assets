    "word": "16-18 (Colossians 2:8). Grasping at the Shadows.--We have encouragement in the Scriptures that if we walk humbly before God, we shall receive instruction. But we are warned against undue curiosity. \"Shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness,\" leading into paths of supposition and imagination, with which we have nothing to do. These are vain, unessential theories of human creation, which keep the mind dwelling upon nothingness. They have in them nothing sure or substantial. Of those who advance these theories, Paul says: \"Their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.\"  {7BC 917.10}  \n     In the days of the apostles the most foolish heresies were presented as truth. History has been and will be repeated. There will always be those who, though apparently conscientious, will grasp at the shadow, preferring it to the substance. They take error in the place of truth, \n                                                                           918\nbecause error is clothed with a new garment, which they think covers something wonderful. But let the covering be removed, and nothingness appears (RH Feb. 5, 1901).  {7BC 917.11}  \n     20 (Matthew 13:47, 48). Both Good and Bad in the Church.--[2 Timothy 2:19, 20 quoted.] The \"great house\" represents the church. In the church will be found the vile as well as the precious. The net cast into the sea gathers both good and bad (RH Feb. 5, 1901).",
