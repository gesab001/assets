    "word": "We feel sincere pity for your blindness. Such freaks [SUDDEN CAUSELESS CHANGE OR TURN OF THE MIND; TO DO FREAKISH ACTS; DIVERGING FROM WHAT IS NATURAL OR NORMAL.--WEBSTER.] as yours cost too much to us and to the cause of God. God is in earnest with us. He will not be trifled with. Be careful how you move. It costs too much to you and to the cause, for you to be pettish and jealous and to move rashly and independently and bring ruin upon yourselves.",
