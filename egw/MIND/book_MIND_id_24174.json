    "word": "Institutions in which medical missionary work can be done are to be regarded as a special essential to the advancement of the Lord's work. The buildings secured for this work should be out of the cities, in rural districts, so that the sick may have the benefit of out-of-door life. By the beauty of flower and field, their minds will be diverted from themselves, from their aches and pains, and they will be led to look from nature to the God of nature, who has provided so abundantly the beauties of the natural world. The convalescent can lie in the shade of the trees, and those who are stronger can, if they wish, work among the flowers, doing just a little at first, and increasing their efforts as they grow stronger. Working in the garden, gathering flowers and fruit, listening to the birds praising God, the patients will be wonderfully blessed. The angels of God will draw near to them. The fresh air and sunshine, and the exercise taken, will bring them life and vitality.",
