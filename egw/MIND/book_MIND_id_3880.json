The call is for men who will go forth imbued with the Spirit of Christ, and work for souls. The minister should not confine his labors to the desk, nor should he settle down in some pleasant home among the brethren. He must watch for souls. He must visit the people at their homes, and by personal efforts seek to impress the truth upon hearts and consciences. He must pray with families and hold Bible readings with them. While with tact and wisdom he urges home upon his fellow men their duty to obey the Word of God, his daily intercourse with them should reveal whatever in his character is good and pure, excellent and lovely, kind and courteous.",
