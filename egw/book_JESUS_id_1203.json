{"word": "Brother and Sister Nichols, of Dorchester, Massachusetts, had heard of my affliction, and their son Henry came to Gorham, bringing things for my comfort. During his visit, my friends again united in prayer for my recovery. After others had prayed, Brother Henry Nichols began to pray most fervently; and with the power of God resting upon him, he arose\n90\nfrom his knees, came across the room, and laid his hands upon my head, saying, \"Sister Ellen, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole,\" and fell back, prostrated by the power of God. I believed that the work was of God, and the pain left me. My soul was filled with gratitude and peace. The language of my heart was: \"There is no help for us but in God. We can be in peace only as we rest in Him and wait for His salvation.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 89}
