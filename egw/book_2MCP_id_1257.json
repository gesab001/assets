{"word": "Religion and Science.--True knowledge is divine. Satan insinuated into the minds of our first parents a desire for \n\n740 \n\na speculative knowledge, whereby he declared they would greatly improve their condition; but in order to gain this, they must take a course contrary to God's holy will, for God would not lead them to the greatest heights. It was not God's purpose that they should obtain knowledge that had its foundation in disobedience. This was a broad field into which Satan was seeking to lead Adam and Eve, and it is the same field that he opens for the world today by his temptations. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 739}
