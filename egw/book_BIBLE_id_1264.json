Whenever a special effort is to be made in an important place, a well arranged system of labor should be established, so that those who wish to become colporteurs and canvassers, and those who are adapted to give Bible readings in families, may \n                                                                           108\nreceive the necessary instruction. Those who are workers should also be learners, and while the minister is laboring in word and doctrine they should not be wandering listlessly about, as though there was nothing in the discourse which they needed to hear. They should not regard the speaker simply as an orator, but as a messenger from God to men. Personal preferences and prejudices must not be allowed to influence them in hearing. If all would imitate the example of Cornelius, and say, \"Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God,\" they would receive much more profit from the sermons which they hear.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 107}
