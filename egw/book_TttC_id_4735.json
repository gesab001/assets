    "word": "The word of God has much to say in regard to sacrificing. Riches are from the Lord and belong to Him. \"Both riches and honor come of Thee.\" \"The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith the Lord of hosts.\" \"For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.\" \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.\" It is the Lord thy God that giveth thee power to get wealth.",
