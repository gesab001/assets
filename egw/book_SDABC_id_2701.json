Christ's Life an Oblation to God.--\"Christ also hath loved us,\" writes Paul, \"and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.\" This is the oblation of a life-gift in our behalf, that we may be all that He desires us to be--representatives of Him, expressing the fragrance of His character, His own pure thoughts, His divine attributes as manifested in His sanctified human life, in order that others may behold Him in His human form, and, comprehending God's wonderful design, be led to desire to be like Christ--pure, undefiled, wholly acceptable to God, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing (MS 159, 1903).",
