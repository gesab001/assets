    "word": "When we began to present the light on the Sabbath question, we had no clearly defined idea of the third angel's message of Revelation 14:9-12. The burden of our testimony as we came before the people was that the great second advent movement was of God, that the first and second messages \n                                                                           79\nhad gone forth, and that the third was to be given. We saw that the third message closed with the words: \"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\" And we as clearly saw as we now see that these prophetic words suggested a Sabbath reform; but as to what the worship of the beast mentioned in the message was, or what the image and the mark of the beast were, we had no defined position.",
