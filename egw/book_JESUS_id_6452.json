{"word": "Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued we can find no rest. The masterful passions of the heart no human power can control. We are as helpless here as were the disciples to control the raging storm. But He who spoke peace to the billows of Galilee has spoken the word of peace for every soul. However fierce the tempest, those who turn to Jesus with the cry, \"Lord, save us,\" will find deliverance. His grace, which reconciles the soul to God, quiets the strife of human passion, and in His love the heart is at rest. . . . \"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (Romans 5:1). \"The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever\" (Isaiah 32:17).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 35}
