    "word": "God has given Brother A Y good abilities, quick perceptions, and a good understanding of His word. If his heart were sanctified, he could have an influence for good with his brothers, as well as his neighbors and those with whom he associates. But the love of money has taken so firm a hold of his soul, and has been so interwoven with all the transactions of life, that he has become conformed to the world instead of being transformed by the renewing of the mind. His powers have been perverted and debased by sordid love of gain, which has made him selfish, penurious, and overbearing. Had his qualities been put into active use in his Master's service, rather than used to serve his own selfish interests, had his object and aim been to do good and glorify God, the qualities of mind that God had given him would impart to his character an energy, humility, and efficiency which could not fail to command respect and would give him an influence over all with whom he associated. \n                                                                           127",
