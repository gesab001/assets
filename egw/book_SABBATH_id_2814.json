{"word": "The old, old story of the love of Jesus, repeated by the teachers and the superintendent, with the love of Jesus in the heart, will have a power that will convict and convert souls. If the love and tenderness of Jesus has touched your heart, you will be able to work for your scholars. The simplicity of the gospel must be kept in view. With help from above we can do faithful work for the Master. The fact should be kept continually before the scholars that without heart work all our \n90\nefforts will be in vain. Affection and love should be seen in every movement of the teachers and managers of the school. Cold formality should be replaced by earnest zeal and energy. The love of Jesus should so pervade the whole school that the pupils will learn to regard this as the highest education. Sternness or faultfinding should find no place in Sabbath-school or day school. This should be put far from the hearts of the teachers, and of all who act a leading part in the school.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 89}
