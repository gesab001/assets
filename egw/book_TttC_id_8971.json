    "word": "After the Camp Meeting \n\n     By camp meetings held in the cities thousands will be called out to hear the invitation to the feast: \"Come; for all things are now ready.\" Luke 14:17. After arousing the interest of the people, we should not cut these meetings short, pulling down all the tents and giving the impression that the meeting is over. Just at the time when hundreds have become interested, the greatest good may be accomplished by faithful and earnest work. Therefore the meetings should be so managed that the public interest may be maintained.",
