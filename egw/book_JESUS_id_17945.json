{"word": "The life we now live must be by faith in Jesus Christ. If we are Christ's followers our lives will not be as pieced out by little cheap spasmodic actions according to circumstances and surroundings--jerking actions, revealing feelings to be our master, indulging in little frettings, envious faultfindings, jealousies, and selfish vanity. These put us all out of harmony with the harmonious life of Jesus Christ, and we cannot be overcomers if we retain these defects. . . .", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 36}
