    "word": "Words of Caution \n\n     Christ said to His disciples: \"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\" Matthew 10:16. Satan's attacks against the advocates of the truth will wax more bitter and determined to the very close of time. As in Christ's day the chief priests and rulers stirred up the people against Him, so today the religious leaders will excite bitterness and prejudice against the truth for this time. The people will be led to acts of violence and opposition which they would never have thought of had they not been imbued with the animosity of professed Christians against the truth.",
