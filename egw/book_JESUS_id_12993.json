{"word": "But the Pharisees took up his words, addressed to those who believed, and commented upon them, saying, \"We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man; how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?\" Jesus looked upon these men,--the slaves of unbelief and bitter malice, whose thoughts were bent upon revenge,--and answered them, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.\" They were in the worst of bondage, ruled by the spirit of evil. Jesus declared to them that if they were the true children of Abraham, and lived in obedience to God, they would not seek to kill one who was speaking the truth that was given him of God. This was not doing the works of Abraham, whom they claimed as their father.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 356}
