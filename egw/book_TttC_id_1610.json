    "word": "\"I HOPE AND PRAY THAT HE MAY YET EMBRACE THE HOLY SABBATH. SISTER THOMPSON DOES BELIEVE IN IT ALREADY. HE IS WONDERFULLY SET IN HIS OWN WAYS, AND OF COURSE THINKS HE IS RIGHT. COULD I ONLY GET HIM TO READ THE BOOKS I BROUGHT, THE HISTORY OF THE SABBATH, ETC., BUT HE LOOKS AT THEM AND CALLS THEM INFIDEL, AND SAYS THEY SEEM TO HIM TO CARRY ERROR IN THEIR FRONT, WHEN, IF THEY WOULD ONLY READ CAREFULLY EACH SENTIMENT OF OUR TENETS, I CAN BUT THINK THEY WOULD EMBRACE THEM AS BIBLE TRUTHS AND SEE THEIR BEAUTY AND CONSISTENCY. I DOUBT NOT BUT THAT SISTER T. WOULD BE GLAD TO IMMEDIATELY BECOME A SEVENTH-DAY \n                                                                           668\nADVENTIST WERE IT NOT THAT HER HUSBAND IS SO BITTERLY OPPOSED TO ANY SUCH THING. IT WAS IMPRESSED UPON MY MIND THAT I HAD A WORK TO DO HERE BEFORE I CAME HERE; BUT THE TRUTH IS PRESENT IN THE FAMILY, AND IF I CAN CARRY IT NO FARTHER, IT WOULD SEEM THAT MY WORK IS DONE, OR NEARLY SO. I DO NOT FEEL LIKE BEING ASHAMED OF CHRIST, OR HIS, IN THIS WICKED GENERATION, AND WOULD MUCH RATHER CAST IN MY LOT WITH SABBATHKEEPERS AND GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE.",
