{"word": "We are to be partakers of knowledge. As I have seen pictures representing Satan\\92s coming to Christ in the wilderness of temptation in the form of a hideous monster, I have thought, How little the artists knew of the Bible! Before his fall Satan was next to Christ, the highest angel in heaven. How foolish then to suppose that he approached Christ in the wilderness in any such form as is given him in the illustration The Game of Life. Some have seen that picture. After the Saviour had fasted forty days and forty nights, \\93he was afterward an hungered.\\94 Then it was that Satan appeared to Him. He came as a beautiful angel from heaven, claiming that he had a commission from God to declare the Saviour\\92s fast at an end. \\93If thou be the Son of God,\\94 he said, \\93command that these stones be made bread.\\94 But in Satan\\92s insinuation of distrust, Christ recognized the enemy whose power He had come to the earth to resist. He would not accept the challenge, nor be moved by the temptation. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 197}
