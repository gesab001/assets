When in conversion the sinner finds peace with God through the blood of the atonement, the Christian life has but just begun. Now he is to \\93go on unto perfection;\\94 to grow up \\93unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\\94 Says the apostle Paul: \\93This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\\94 [Philippians 3:13, 14.] And Peter sets before us the steps by which Bible sanctification is to be attained: \\93Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. . . . If ye do these things, ye shall never fall.\\94 [2 Peter 1:5-10.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 470}
