    "word": "Last winter when we saw that we must have a school to meet the demands of the cause, we were put to our wits ends to know where we should obtain the funds. I was suffering with prostration of the nerves, and suffering from rheumatism. Our rent was $23.00 a month and water bills extra, and other expenses were still added to this, aside from the buying of food. A carriage had to be purchased, and although secondhand, it cost me $200.00. \n                                                                           1180\nNothing but what was easy of access and comfortable would be of any service to me then. And even to ride only a short distance was at times next to impossible. My hips and spine caused me such keen suffering, almost beyond endurance. The keeping of a horse, and sickness increased our household expenses so that it dared not hardly be estimated. But to return to the school question. Some thought it could not be done; yet we know that it must be started in 1892. Some thought all that could be done was to hold a short institute for the ministers.",
