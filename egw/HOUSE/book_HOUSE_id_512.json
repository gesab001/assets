    "word": "A FALSE HUMILITY\n \n     There were some who professed great humility, and advocated creeping on the floor like children, as an evidence of their humility. They claimed that the\n73\n74\nwords of Christ in Matthew 18:1-6 must have a literal fulfillment at this period, when they were looking for their Saviour to return. They would creep around their houses, on the street, over bridges, and in the church itself.",
