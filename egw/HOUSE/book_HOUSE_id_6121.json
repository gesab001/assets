    "word": "Let all take heed as to the principles that govern their dealings with one another, for all their works are to be brought into judgment. There must be no confederacy to ignore the individuality of the publishing work on the Pacific Coast. Let not our brethren attempt to submerge the identity of the Pacific Press in the publishing house at Battle \n\n\n                    -9- \n\nCreek, thinking to increase the strength of both. The Pacific Press has been led to depend too largely upon Battle Creek; its managers should have discerned the talents to be found on the Pacific Coast, and would have shown true wisdom in securing all the ability possible in order to make their work a complete whole. Let the B. C. publishing house and the Pacific Press regard each other as sister institutions. In co-operation they can exert a healthful influence upon each other, but not in consolidation. These institutions are not to become merged into one. The managers in Battle Creek have indulged unchristian, unbrotherly feelings, even envy and jealousy, toward the Pacific Publishing House. They have had a feverish desire to belittle that institution, and to bring it under their own jurisdiction, but the light that I have had for years is that these institutions must stand separate, each preserving its own individuality. A nearer relation than this will tend to the injury of both.",
