    "word": "Young  Women  to Have Knowledge of Household Duties.--Many\n212\nladies, accounted well-educated, having graduated with honors at some institution of learning, are shamefully ignorant of the practical duties of life.  They are destitute of the qualifications necessary for the proper regulation of the family, and hence essential to its happiness.  They may talk of woman's elevated sphere, and of her rights, yet they themselves fall far below the true sphere of woman.",
