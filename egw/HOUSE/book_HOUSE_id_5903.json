But no one will ever enter heaven who \n                                                                           12\nis not a laborer together with God. If you had any appreciation of the salvation brought to you at infinite cost, you would arouse, you would lay hold upon the strength of Jesus, you would lift up your voice like a trumpet, and show \"My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\" You would cry loud, and spare not.
