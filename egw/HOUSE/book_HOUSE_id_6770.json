    "word": "MR No. 390 - Improper Literature\n\n     The enemy has had his way with your daughter until his bands have bound her about like bands of steel, and it will require a strong and persevering effort to save her soul. If you have success in this case, no half way work will do. The habits of years cannot easily be broken up. She should be placed where there is a steady, firm, abiding influence constantly exercised. If I were in your place I would do all I could. I should put her in the college at Healdsburg; let her have the discipline of the boarding house. . . . You have encouraged the reading of story books, and papers with continued stories lying upon your tables have educated and trained the taste and appetite of your daughter until she is a mental inebriate and needs a stronger power and will than her own to hold her.--Letter 12, 1886, pp. 1, 2. (To Sister Chapman, December 27, 1886.)",
