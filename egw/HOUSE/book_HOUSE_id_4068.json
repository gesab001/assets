    "word": "4SP - The Spirit of Prophecy Volume Four (1884)\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n     IT IS WITH MUCH PLEASURE THAT WE SEND FORTH THIS BOOK, VOL. IV. OF THE SERIES ON \"THE GREAT CONTROVERSY BETWEEN CHRIST AND SATAN.\" VOL. I., BEGINNING WITH THE FALL OF SATAN, EMBRACES OLD-TESTAMENT HISTORY. VOL. II. CONTAINS THE LIFE OF CHRIST; VOL. III., THE LIVES OF THE APOSTLES; AND THIS VOLUME, GIVING FIRST A SKETCH OF OUR LORD'S GREAT PROPHECY (WHICH, IN BRIEF, COVERS THE WHOLE DISPENSATION), CONTAINS A HISTORY OF THE CHURCH IN HER WARFARE TO HER FINAL REDEMPTION, AND VIVIDLY DESCRIBES THE TRIUMPH OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD, THE DESTRUCTION OF SATAN AND ALL HIS FOLLOWERS, AND THE RENEWING OF THE EARTH, WHICH ENDS THE AWFUL CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE SON OF GOD AND THE POWERS OF DARKNESS.\n     APART FROM THE BIBLE, THIS SERIES PRESENTS THE MOST WONDERFUL AND INTENSELY INTERESTING HISTORY OF THE WORLD, FROM THE ENTERING OF SIN TO THE COMPLETE RESTITUTION OF ALL THINGS, THAT HAS EVER BEEN PUBLISHED. AND AS THE CLOSING EVENTS OF THE DISPENSATION ARE THE MOST MOMENTOUS,--THE DESTRUCTION OF SATAN AND ALL THAT PERTAINS TO HIS WORK, AND THE REVEALING OF THE COMING GLORY, BEING UNPARALLELED BY ALL EVENTS THAT PRECEDE THEM,--SO THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOOK ARE, IN MANY RESPECTS, MORE DEEPLY INTERESTING THAN THOSE OF THE VOLUMES WHICH PRECEDED IT. THE CLOSING CHAPTERS ARE MOST THRILLING. THEY WILL BE BEST APPRECIATED, HOWEVER, BY THOSE WHO READ ALL THE FOUR VOLUMES IN CONNECTION.\n     WE WOULD SAY TO THOSE WHO HAVE FELT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THIS VOLUME WAS NOT ISSUED SOONER, THAT WE BELIEVE THE DELAY WAS PROVIDENTIAL, AS THE BOOK CONTAINS MATTER\n\niv\n\nOF GREAT INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE WHICH IT WOULD NOT HAVE CONTAINED HAD IT BEEN PUBLISHED SOONER. AND STILL THIS VOLUME DOES NOT GIVE ALL THAT THE WRITER HAS TO PRESENT ON THE CLOSING SCENES OF THIS DISPENSATION. SOME MATTERS WHICH COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE INSERTED IN THIS WORK (SPACE BEING LIMITED), WILL BE PUBLISHED SEPARATELY. AS IT IS, THIS BOOK IS LARGER THAN WAS INTENDED.\n     WE HAVE FAITH THAT THE MERCIFUL FATHER IS IN KINDNESS BESTOWING UPON HIS WAITING PEOPLE THE LIGHT AND INSTRUCTION WHICH THEY SPECIALLY NEED IN THE PERILS OF THE LAST DAYS. GOD IS WILLING TO GIVE HIS SPIRIT TO THOSE WHO ASK HIM, TO THOSE WHO CALL UPON HIM IN TRUTH. WE BELIEVE THAT THE WRITER HAS RECEIVED THE ILLUMINATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN PREPARING THESE PAGES,--IN LAYING BEFORE US THE NATURE OF THE GREAT CONTROVERSY BETWEEN CHRIST AND SATAN, THAT WE MAY BE WARNED AGAINST THE SNARES OF THE ENEMY, AND PREPARED FOR AN INHERITANCE WITH THE SAINTS IN LIGHT.\n     WHILE MANY SUBJECTS HERE PRESENTED ARE OF WONDROUS DEPTH,--RELATING TO \"THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD,\"--THEY ARE PRESENTED IN LANGUAGE EASY TO BE UNDERSTOOD. AND WE ARE HAPPY IN KNOWING THAT THE READING OF THESE WORKS LEADS TO GREATER LOVE FOR THE HOLY SCRIPTURES, AND TO REVERENCE FOR THE GOD OF GRACE, IN WHOM ARE ALL THE TREASURES OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE.\n     THAT THIS VOLUME MAY PROVE A BLESSING TO ALL WHO READ IT, AND REDOUND TO THE GLORY OF THE MOST HIGH, IS THE EARNEST PRAYER OF THE\n                    PUBLISHERS.\n\n\nTable of
