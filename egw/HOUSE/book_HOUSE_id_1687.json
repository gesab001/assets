    "word": "GC88 - The Great Controversy (1888)\n\n\nPUBLISHER'S PREFACE\n\n     WHEN THE LEADER OF THOSE \u201cANGELS WHICH KEPT NOT THEIR FIRST ESTATE\u201d (JUDE 6) FELL FROM HIS HOLY AND EXALTED PLACE IN HEAVEN, HE PRECIPITATED UPON THE UNIVERSE OF GOD AN AWFUL CONTROVERSY. {GC88 a.1} \n     FROM THE VERY NATURE OF THE CASE, THERE MUST BE ETERNAL ANTAGONISM BETWEEN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SIN. BETWEEN PURITY AND POLLUTION THERE CAN BE NO COALITION; NOR COULD THE SUPREME AUTHOR OF ALL THINGS, THE GOD IN WHOM INHERES EVERY PERFECTION, MAINTAIN ANY OTHER THAN AN ATTITUDE OF UNCOMPROMISING HOSTILITY TO SIN AND ALL ITS FRUITS, TO THE AUTHOR OF REBELLION AND ALL HIS FOLLOWERS. {GC88 a.2} \n     ANOTHER CONCLUSION IS APPARENT: GOD, AS THE FOE OF ALL EVIL, AND AT THE SAME TIME OMNIPOTENT, COULD NOT, CONSISTENTLY WITH HIS OWN NATURE, SUFFER REBELLION TO ENTER WITHIN HIS REALMS, AND ABIDE FOREVER. THE INTRUDER MUST BE CAST OUT; THE DISTURBER OF THE PEACE MUST BE DESTROYED. THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION AS TO THE ISSUE OF THIS CONTROVERSY BETWEEN A HOLY CREATOR AND THE REBELLIOUS CREATURE. {GC88 a.3} \n     THAT SIN MIGHT MAKE A FULL REVELATION OF ITS NATURE AND RESULTS TO THE INTELLIGENCES OF ALL WORLDS, THIS CONTROVERSY WAS NOT ARRESTED IN ITS INCEPTION. WHEN SIN IS FINALLY DESTROYED, IT WILL HAVE GIVEN SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SATISFY EVERY MIND THAT IT DESERVES THE INFLICTION; AND ALL WILL JOYFULLY ACQUIESCE IN ITS MERITED DOOM. {GC88 a.4} \n     HAPPILY WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT, OUTSIDE THE APOSTATE ANGELS, ANY OTHER WORLD THAN OUR OWN HAS FALLEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS SINFUL REVOLT. BUT THIS IS ENOUGH TO MAKE IT A MATTER OF ABSORBING INTEREST TO US; FOR SATAN AND HIS ANGELS BEING CAST OUT OF HEAVEN, THIS WORLD HAS BECOME THE SOLE THEATER OF THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG. ALL MEN HAVE BECOME INVOLVED THEREIN. BETWEEN THEM AND SALVATION THERE LIES THE PROBLEM OF RECOVERY FROM SIN, THE ATTAINMENT TO A CONDITION OF RECONCILIATION AND ACCEPTANCE WITH GOD. {GC88 a.5} \n     WHAT THEME IS THEREFORE ENTITLED TO BE REGARDED WITH MORE ABSORBING INTEREST THAN THIS GREAT CONTROVERSY\u2014THE STAGES THROUGH WHICH IT HAS PASSED, ITS PRESENT DEVELOPMENT, AND THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE. HOW AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE CONTROVERSY END? AND HAVE WE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE LONG-WISHED-FOR TERMINATION IS DRAWING NEAR? {GC88 a.6} \n     TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE GREAT THEMES THE FOLLOWING PAGES ARE\nb\nDEVOTED; AND WE HAVE THE CLEAREST ASSURANCE THAT THE AUTHOR POSSESSES PECULIAR QUALIFICATIONS FOR SUCH A WORK. FROM HER CHILDHOOD SHE HAS BEEN NOTED FOR HER REVERENCE AND LOVE FOR THE WORD OF GOD, AND HER PIETY AND DEVOTION TO HIS SERVICE. UNBOUNDED FAITH IN THE PROMISES OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES HAS BEEN BOTH AN INDUCEMENT AND A MEANS TO ENABLE HER TO LIVE NEAR TO THE SAVIOUR. THE BLESSING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS BEEN VOUCHSAFED TO HER IN LARGE MEASURE. AND AS ONE OF THE OFFICES OF THIS SPIRIT WAS DECLARED TO BE TO SHOW UNTO THE FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST \u201cTHINGS TO COME\u201d (JOHN 16:13), WORKING THROUGH THAT PRESCRIBED CHANNEL WHICH, AS ONE OF THE ENDOWMENTS OF THE CHURCH, IS DESCRIBED AS THE GIFT OF PROPHECY (1 CORINTHIANS 12:9, 10; 14:1), SO WE BELIEVE SHE HAS BEEN EMPOWERED BY A DIVINE ILLUMINATION TO SPEAK OF SOME PAST EVENTS WHICH HAVE THUS BEEN BROUGHT TO HER ATTENTION, WITH GREATER MINUTENESS THAN IS SET FORTH IN ANY EXISTING RECORDS, AND TO READ THE FUTURE WITH MORE THAN HUMAN FORESIGHT. THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT IT IS TO HOLD COMMUNION WITH OUR HEAVENLY FATHER, WILL, WE THINK, AS THEY READ THESE PAGES, FEEL CONSTRAINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE WRITER HAS DRAWN FROM THE HEAVENLY FOUNTAIN, AND RECEIVED HELP FROM THAT THRONE OF GRACE WHERE CHRIST SITTETH AS OUR MERCIFUL HIGH PRIEST, AND WHENCE HE IS EVER READY TO SEND FORTH ASSISTANCE TO THE MANY SONS WHOM HE IS BRINGING UNTO GLORY. HEBREWS 2:10. {GC88 a.7} \n     ASIDE FROM THE GREAT VOLUME OF INSPIRATION\u2014THE BIBLE\u2014NO OTHER BOOK PRESENTS A MORE WONDERFUL AND INTENSELY INTERESTING HISTORY OF THE PRESENT DISPENSATION, TO THE COMPLETE RESTITUTION OF ALL THINGS, THAN THE VOLUME HERE OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC. AND AS THE CLOSING SCENES OF THIS WORLD'S HISTORY ARE OF THE MOST THRILLING AND MOMENTOUS NATURE, THESE ARE MORE PARTICULARLY DWELT UPON IN THIS WORK. THE READER, AS HE FOLLOWS THE NARRATIVE, BEGINNING WITH A SKETCH OF OUR LORD'S GREAT PROPHECY IN MATTHEW 24, WILL FIND HIMSELF ENTERING INTO NEW SYMPATHY WITH THE CHURCH IN HER WARFARE AND HER SUFFERINGS, AS SHE PASSES ON TO HER PROMISED REDEMPTION; AND THE SOUL OF EVERY BELIEVER WILL KINDLE AT THE VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE FINAL TRIUMPH OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD, THE DESTRUCTION OF SATAN AND ALL HIS FOLLOWERS, THE TOTAL AND ETERNAL EXTIRPATION OF EVIL FROM THE UNIVERSE, AND THE RENOVATION OF THE EARTH AS THE EVERLASTING INHERITANCE OF THE SAINTS, WHEN THIS GREAT CONTROVERSY IS CONCLUDED. {GC88 b.1} \n     WHILE THE SUBJECTS HERE PRESENTED INVOLVE THE LOFTIEST IMAGERY, AND MOST WONDERFUL DEPTH, EVEN AS THE APOSTLE DECLARES, \u201cTHE DEEP THINGS OF GOD,\u201d WHICH THE SPIRIT ALONE IS CAPABLE OF SEARCHING INTO (COR. 2:10), YET THEY ARE TREATED IN LANGUAGE CHASTE, SIMPLE, AND EASY TO BE UNDERSTOOD. AND WE REJOICE TO KNOW THAT THE READING OF THIS WORK LEADS TO GREATER CONFIDENCE IN, AND LOVE FOR, THE HOLY SCRIPTURES, TO GREATER SYMPATHY WITH CHRIST, IN HIS MARVELOUS WORK FOR THE REDEMPTION OF\nc\nMEN, AND TO GREATER REVERENCE FOR THE GOD OF ALL GRACE, IN WHOM ARE ALL THE TREASURES OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE. {GC88 b.2} \n     NUMEROUS EDITIONS OF THIS WORK HAVING ALREADY BEEN EXHAUSTED, WE FEEL A PECULIAR GRATIFICATION IN SENDING FORTH THIS EDITION, ENLARGED AND IMPROVED, AND ADAPTED TO CIRCULATE IN VARIOUS TONGUES. THE ILLUSTRATIONS WILL ADD TO THE INTEREST AND VALUE OF THE WORK. MAY IT STILL PROVE A BLESSING TO ALL WHO READ, AND REDOUND TO THE GLORY OF THE MOST HIGH. {GC88 c.1} \n\nAuthor's Preface\n\n     Before the entrance of sin, Adam enjoyed open communion with his Maker; but since man separated himself from God by transgression, the human race has been cut off from this high privilege. By the plan of redemption, however, a way has been opened whereby the inhabitants of the earth may still have connection with Heaven. God has communicated with men by his Spirit, and divine light has been imparted to the world by revelations to his chosen servants. \u201cHoly men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u201d 2 Peter 1:21.  {GC88 c.2} \n     During the first twenty-five hundred years of human history, there was no written revelation. Those who had been taught of God, communicated their knowledge to others, and it was handed down from father to son, through successive generations. The preparation of the written word began in the time of Moses. Inspired revelations were then embodied in an inspired book. This work continued during the long period of sixteen hundred years, from Moses, the historian of creation and the law, to John, the recorder of the most sublime truths of the gospel.  {GC88 c.3} \n     The Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by human hands; and in the varied style of its different books it presents the characteristics of the several writers. The truths revealed are all \u201cgiven by inspiration of God\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16); yet they are expressed in the words of men. The Infinite One by his Holy Spirit has shed light into the minds and hearts of his servants. He has given dreams and visions, symbols and figures; and those to whom the truth was thus revealed, have themselves embodied the thought in human language.  {GC88 c.4} \n     The ten commandments were spoken by God himself, and were written by his own hand. They are of divine, and not human composition. But the Bible, with its God-given truths expressed in the language of men, presents a union of the divine and the human. Such a union existed in the nature of Christ, who was the Son of God and \nd\nthe Son of man. Thus it is true of the Bible, as it was of Christ, that \u201cthe Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\u201d John 1:14.  {GC88 c.5} \n     Written in different ages, by men who differed widely in rank and occupation, and in mental and spiritual endowments, the books of the Bible present a wide contrast in style, as well as a diversity in the nature of the subjects unfolded. Different forms of expression are employed by different writers; often the same truth is more strikingly presented by one than by another. And as several writers present a subject under varied aspects and relations, there may appear, to the superficial, careless, or prejudiced reader, to be discrepancy or contradiction, where the thoughtful, reverent student, with clearer insight, discerns the underlying harmony.  {GC88 d.1} \n     As presented through different individuals, the truth is brought out in its varied aspects. One writer is more strongly impressed with one phase of a subject; he grasps those points that harmonize with his experience or with his power of perception and appreciation; another seizes upon a different phase; and each, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, presents what is most forcibly impressed upon his own mind; a different aspect of the truth in each, but a perfect harmony through all. And the truths thus revealed unite to form a perfect whole, adapted to meet the wants of men in all the circumstances and experiences of life.  {GC88 d.2} \n     God has been pleased to communicate his truth to the world by human agencies, and he himself, by his Holy Spirit, qualified men and enabled them to do this work. He guided the mind in the selection of what to speak and what to write. The treasure was intrusted to earthen vessels, yet it is, none the less, from Heaven. The testimony is conveyed through the imperfect expression of human language; yet it is the testimony of God; and the obedient, believing child of God beholds in it the glory of a divine power, full of grace and truth.  {GC88 d.3} \n     In his Word, God has committed to men the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be accepted as an authoritative, infallible revelation of his will. They are the standard of character, the revealer of doctrines, and the test of experience. \u201cEvery scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.\u201d 2 Timothy 3:16, 17, Revised Version.  {GC88 d.4} \n     Yet the fact that God has revealed his will to men through his Word, has not rendered needless the continued presence and guiding of the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, the Spirit was promised by our Saviour, to open the Word to his servants, to illuminate and apply its teachings. And since it was the Spirit of God that inspired the Bible, it is\ne\nimpossible that the teaching of the Spirit should ever be contrary to that of the Word.  {GC88 d.5} \n     The Spirit was not given\u2014nor can it ever be bestowed\u2014to supersede the Bible; for the Scriptures explicitly state that the Word of God is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. Says the apostle John, \u201cBelieve not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.\u201d 1 John 4:1. And Isaiah declares, \u201cTo the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\u201d Isaiah 8:20.  {GC88 e.1} \n     Great reproach has been cast upon the work of the Holy Spirit, by the errors of a class that, claiming its enlightenment, profess to have no further need of guidance from the Word of God. They are governed by impressions which they regard as the voice of God in the soul. But the spirit that controls them is not the Spirit of God. This following of impressions, to the neglect of the Scriptures, can lead only to confusion, to deception and ruin. It serves only to further the designs of the evil one. Since the ministry of the Holy Spirit is of vital importance to the church of Christ, it is one of the devices of Satan, through the errors of extremists and fanatics to cast contempt upon the work of the Spirit, and cause the people of God to neglect this source of strength which our Lord himself has provided.  {GC88 e.2} \n     In harmony with the Word of God, his Spirit was to continue its work throughout the entire period of the gospel dispensation. During the ages while the Scriptures of both the Old and the New Testament were being given, the Holy Spirit did not cease to communicate light to individual minds, apart from the revelations to be embodied in the sacred canon. The Bible itself relates how, through the Holy Spirit, men received warning, reproof, counsel, and instruction, in matters in no way relating to the giving of the Scriptures. And mention is made of prophets in different ages, of whose utterances nothing is recorded. In like manner, after the close of the canon of Scripture, the Holy Spirit was still to continue its work, to enlighten, warn, and comfort the children of God.  {GC88 e.3} \n     Jesus promised his disciples, \u201cThe Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\u201d \u201cWhen he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth; . . . and he will show you things to come.\u201d John 14:26; 16:13. Scripture plainly teaches that these promises, so far from being limited to apostolic days, extend to the church of Christ in all ages. The Saviour assures his followers, \u201cI am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:20. And Paul declares \nf\nthat the gifts and manifestations of the Spirit were set in the church \u201cfor the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\u201d Ephesians 4:12, 13.  {GC88 e.4} \n     For the believers at Ephesus the apostle prayed, \u201cThat the God of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the  Spirit of wisdom and revelation  in the knowledge of him;  the eyes of your understanding being enlightened;  that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what . . . is the  exceeding greatness  of his power to us-ward who believe.\u201d Ephesians 1:17-19. The ministry of the divine Spirit in enlightening the understanding and opening to the mind the deep things of God's holy Word, was the blessing which Paul thus besought for the Ephesian church.  {GC88 f.1} \n     After the wonderful manifestation of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, Peter exhorted the people to repentance and baptism in the name of Christ, for the remission of their sins; and he said, \u201cYe shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.\u201d Acts 2:38, 39.  {GC88 f.2} \n     In immediate connection with the scenes of the great day of God, the Lord by the prophet Joel has promised a special manifestation of his Spirit. Joel 2:28. This prophecy received a partial fulfillment in the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost; but it will reach its full accomplishment in the manifestation of divine grace which will attend the closing work of the gospel.  {GC88 f.3} \n     The great controversy between good and evil will increase in intensity to the very close of time. In all ages the wrath of Satan has been manifested against the church of Christ; and God has bestowed his grace and Spirit upon his people to strengthen them to stand against the power of the evil one. When the apostles of Christ were to bear his gospel to the world and to record it for all future ages, they were especially endowed with the enlightenment of the Spirit. But as the church approaches her final deliverance, Satan is to work with greater power. He comes down \u201chaving great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\u201d Revelation 12:12. He will work \u201cwith all power and signs and lying wonders.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:9. For six thousand years that master-mind that once was highest among the angels of God, has been wholly bent to the work of deception and ruin. And all the depths of Satanic skill and subtlety acquired, all the cruelty developed, during these struggles of the ages, will be brought to bear against God's people in the final conflict. And in this time of\ng\nperil the followers of Christ are to bear to the world the warning of the Lord's second advent; and a people are to be prepared to stand before him at his coming, \u201cwithout spot, and blameless.\u201d 2 Peter 3:14. At this time the special endowment of divine grace and power is not less needful to the church than in apostolic days.  {GC88 f.4} \n     Through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, the scenes of the long-continued conflict between good and evil have been opened to the writer of these pages. From time to time I have been permitted to behold the working, in different ages, of the great controversy between Christ, the Prince of life, the author of our salvation, and Satan, the prince of evil, the author of sin, the first transgressor of God's holy law. Satan's enmity against Christ has been manifested against his followers. The same hatred of the principles of God's law, the same policy of deception, by which error is made to appear as truth, by which human laws are substituted for the law of God, and men are led to worship the creature rather than the Creator, may be traced in all the history of the past. Satan's efforts to misrepresent the character of God, to cause men to cherish a false conception of the Creator, and thus to regard him with fear and hate rather than with love, his endeavors to set aside the divine law, leading the people to think themselves free from its requirements, and his persecution of those who dare to resist his deceptions, have been steadfastly pursued in all ages. They may be traced in the history of patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, of martyrs and reformers.  {GC88 g.1} \n     In the great final conflict, Satan will employ the same policy, manifest the same spirit, and work for the same end, as in all preceding ages. That which has been, will be, except that the coming struggle will be marked with a terrible intensity such as the world has never witnessed. Satan's deceptions will be more subtle, his assaults more determined. If it were possible, he would lead astray the elect. Mark 13:22, Reevised Version.  {GC88 g.2} \n     As the Spirit of God has opened to my mind the great truths of his Word, and the scenes of the past and the future, I have been bidden to make known to others what has thus been revealed,\u2014to trace the history of the controversy in past ages, and especially to so present it as to shed a light on the fast-approaching struggle of the future. In pursuance of this purpose, I have endeavored to select and group together events in the history of the church in such a manner as to trace the unfolding of the great testing truths that at different periods have been given to the world, that have excited the wrath of Satan, and the enmity of a world-loving  church, and that have been maintained by the witness of those who \u201cloved not their lives unto the death.\u201d  {GC88 g.3} \n     In these records we may see a foreshadowing of the conflict before\nh\nus. Regarding them in the light of God's Word, and by the illumination of his Spirit, we may see unveiled the devices of the wicked one, and the dangers which they must shun who would be found \u201cwithout fault\u201d before the Lord at his coming.  {GC88 g.4} \n     The great events which have marked the progress of reform in past ages, are matters of history, well known and universally acknowledged by the Protestant world; they are facts which none can gainsay. This history I have presented briefly, in accordance with the scope of the book, and the brevity which must necessarily be observed, the  facts having been condensed into as little space as seemed consistent with a proper understanding of their application. In some cases where a historian has so grouped together events as to afford, in brief, a comprehensive view of the subject, or has summarized details in a convenient manner, his words have been quoted; but except in a few instances no specific credit has been given, since they are not quoted for the purpose of citing that writer as authority, but because his statement affords a ready and forcible presentation of the subject. In narrating the experience and views of those carrying forward the work of reform in our own time, similar use has occasionally been made of their published works.  {GC88 h.1} \n     It is not so much the object of this book to present new truths concerning the struggles of former times, as to bring out facts and principles which have a bearing upon coming events. Yet viewed as a part of the controversy between the forces of light and darkness, all these records of the past are seen to have a new significance; and through them a light is cast upon the future, illumining the pathway of those who, like the reformers of past ages, will be called, even at the peril of all earthly good, to witness \u201cfor the Word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.\u201d  {GC88 h.2} \n     To unfold the scenes of the great controversy between truth and error; to reveal the wiles of Satan, and the means by which he may be successfully resisted; to present a satisfactory solution of the great problem of evil, shedding such a light upon the origin and the final disposition of sin as to fully make manifest the justice and benevolence of God in all his dealings with his creatures; and to show the holy, unchanging nature of his law, is the object of this book. That through its influence souls may be delivered from the power of darkness, and become \u201cpartakers of the inheritance of the saints in light,\u201d to the praise of Him who loved us, and gave himself for us, is the earnest prayer of the writer. \n\n                                                         E.

Jerusalem\n\n     \u201cIf thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one Stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.\u201d [Luke 19:42-44.]",
