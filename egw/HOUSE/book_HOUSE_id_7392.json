    "word": "[Ezekiel 3:17-22, quoted.] These solemn words speak to you and me. I have to bear the plain notes of warning from God. I must not suffer my brother to continue in sin. [I must warn him of] his danger. I must tell him \"the wages of sin is death.\" God has said it. \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sin\" [Isaiah 58:1]. Here, my brother, is a work that you have not done as you should have done. And why? Because your own soul was not right before God. [Following line illegible.]",
