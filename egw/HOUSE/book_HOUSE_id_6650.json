    "word": "Brooklyn, New York, November 15, 1890. We arrived here in this city Friday morning. I was pleased to ride all the way from the ferry in the streetcar and not on the elevated railroad. We had a good room assigned to \n\n\n                                    -307- \n\nmy use exclusively, but the elevated railroad goes directly by the house and I was fearful the thundering noise would prevent me from sleeping. There is a large company who are being accommodated in three different tenements.",
