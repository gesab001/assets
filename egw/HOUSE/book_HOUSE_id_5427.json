He sends the springs to run among the hills, where the birds have their habitation and \u201csing among the branches\u201d (verse 12). All the creatures of the woods and hills are a part of His great household. He opens His hand, and satisfies \u201cthe desire of every living thing\u201d (Psalm 145:16).",
