    "word": "You will be glad to know that the preparations for opening this building as a sanitarium are going forward rapidly. For some time the men have \n\n\n                                      -219- \n\nbeen digging a well on the flat, and they have found water. They have gone down 90 feet, and they wish to go 10 feet further if possible. Last evening Brother [E.R.] Palmer came to my room so full of joy that he could scarcely speak, to tell me that a stream of water as big as his hand was coming into the well; and this morning there is 14 feet of soft, pure water in the well. I never saw a man more rejoiced than Brother Palmer was. The thought that there is a lake of soft water 100 feet or more below us has sent a thrill of joy through our hearts. There will be all the water that is needed, both for use in the house and for watering the olive and orange trees on the place.",
