    "word": "Money Advanced by Ellen White to Build the Beldens a House--I am pleased that you can dispose of my place in Battle Creek. The mortgage will cut out quite a slice, but I will probably have fifteen hundred dollars. Five hundred of this must go to build a small cottage for Brother and Sister Belden. Both are quite incapacitated as far as means is concerned by their stay in Norfolk Island. The money I receive will allow me to build them a comfortable house. Brother Belden works a little, but he has been very sick, and is yet far from well. He has nothing at all to depend on. But they want for nothing, and shall be cared for as long as I and they shall live.--Letter 73, 1899, pp. 11,12. (To Dr. Kellogg, April 17, 1899.)",
