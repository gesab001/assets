    "word": "DANIEL REMAINED FAITHFUL IN PRAYER IN SPITE OF PERSECUTION.\u2014Did Daniel cease to pray because this decree was to go into force!\u2014No, that was just the time when he needed to pray. \u201cWhen Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and, his window being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.\u201d Daniel did not seek to hide his loyalty to God. He did not pray in his heart, but with his voice, aloud, with his window open toward Jerusalem, he offered up his petition to heaven. Then his enemies made their complaint to the king, and Daniel was thrown into the den of lions. But the Son of God was there. The angel of the Lord encamped round about the servant of the Lord, and when the king came in the morning, and called, \u201cO Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live forever. My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions\u2019 mouths, that they have not hurt me.\u201d No harm had come to him, and he magnified the Lord God of heaven.\u2014(Review and Herald, May 3, 1892.)",
