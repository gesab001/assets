    "word": "A member of parliament who came to Cooranbong occasionally, and who had purchased the house in which we first lived in Cooranbong, visited our garden and orchard, and was greatly pleased with it. Several times we filled a large basket with fruit and took it to him and his wife at their home, and they were profuse in their thanks. After this they would always recognize us on the cars, and speak of the great treat they had had in the fruit from our orchard. When they would visit us at our farm, they were always at liberty to eat all they wanted from the garden, and usually carried away a basket of fruit to their home.",
