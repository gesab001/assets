White.) \n\n     I have sent you one letter since coming back to Basel. In regard to Marian's coming I dare not say. If I was sure that we would go to America next May, I would not think it best to disappoint Marian's plans. I just want her to do the things that will be for her health and after-usefulness. If she really wishes to give some time to study, she ought to have the privilege of doing this. I dare not urge her to come to Europe. I will send matters to be published if I am able to write. I shall not write as diligently as I have done.",
