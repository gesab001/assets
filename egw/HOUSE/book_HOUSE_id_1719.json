    "word": "In the seventh chapter of Ezra the decree is found. [Ezra 7:12-26.] In its completest form it was issued by Artaxerxes, king of Persia, B. C. 457. But in Ezra 6:14 the house of the Lord at Jerusalem is said to have been built \u201caccording to the commandment [margin, decree] of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.\u201d These three kings, in originating, re-affirming, and completing the decree, brought it to the perfection required by the prophecy to mark the beginning \n327\nof the 2300 years. Taking B. C. 457, the time when the decree was completed, as the date of the commandment, every specification of the prophecy concerning the seventy weeks was seen to have been fulfilled.",
