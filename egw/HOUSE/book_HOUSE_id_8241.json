    "word": "(887) \"When once the Master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know ye not whence ye are; Then shall ye begin to say, we have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets, but he shall say, I tell you I know you not whence ye are; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity. And there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourself thrust out. And they shall come from East, and from the West and from the North and from the South, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. And behold there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.",
