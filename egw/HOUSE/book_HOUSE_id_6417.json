    "word": "Elder Irwin met us at the place and showed us something of the grounds and buildings. As we drove along I marked the advantages over the Buena Vista property. True, there was not here the fine costly building that we found on the Sonoma property, but there were a number of buildings in good repair, and such as could be easily adapted to the needs of the school. The largest of the dwellings was a house of 32 rooms, and in addition to this there were four cottages. All the rooms were well planned, and substantially but not extravagantly furnished. Everything about the houses and grounds looked clean and wholesome.",
