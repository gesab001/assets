    "word": "After the prodigal son had come as low as he could come he thought of the kindness and love of his father. He felt then the need of a father. His position of friendlessness and want he had brought upon himself through disobedience and sin, which had resulted in his separating himself from his father. He thought of the privileges and bounties of his father's house, that the hired servants of his father freely enjoyed, while he who had alienated himself from his father's house was perishing with hunger. He was humiliated through adversity, and decided to return to his father by humble confession. He was a beggar, destitute of comfortable, or even decent, clothing. He was wretched in consequence of privation, and was emaciated with hunger.",
