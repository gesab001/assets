    "word": "My Father, my Father, I present before Thee the merits of our Redeemer, Thy Son Jesus, who suffered the awful agonies of the cross to redeem the race. I plead with Thee that Thou wouldst break up the fallow ground of the heart, in order that the seeds of truth may become fastened in the mind and spring up and bear the best kind of fruit, to the glory of God. We cannot endure the thought that of the large number who are in this congregation, many at last may say that \"the harvest is past, the summer is ended,\" the final proffers of salvation have been made, and my soul is not saved! What an awful acknowledgment this would be! Break, I pray Thee, break the minds of the congregation, so that every one of us may seek Thee with all the heart, as we go out from this house, in order that we may carry with us the impression of the Spirit of God. Help, oh, help us to be converted, that the light of heaven may come into our minds and our souls, and that we may have something to say in honor of Jesus, to glorify His name upon the earth.",
