    "word": "The Paradise Valley Sanitarium cost the original owners $25,000. [THE MAIN BUILDING COST $25,000, BUT THE TOTAL INVESTMENT IN LAND AND BUILDINGS WAS $50,000. SEE PP. 241, 260.] Almost all the rooms are furnished with a marble washstand. Water is laid on all over the house. The rooms are beautifully arranged, and are very airy. There are broad verandas around two sides of the house. The building stands on a high rise of ground, and the lawns and gardens were once very beautiful. Many of the ornamental trees died during the long drought, but this year a good supply of rain has fallen, and all the lawns are green again.",
