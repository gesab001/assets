    "word": "The world full of rioting, full of godless pleasure, is asleep, asleep in carnal security, putting afar off the coming of the Lord, laughing at warnings, calling those who try to arouse their attention, almost fanatics, enthusiasts, not levelheaded. The lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God are taken unawares. This is the proud boast that is made, \"All things remain as they were from the beginning. Tomorrow shall be as this day, only much more abundant.\" We will go deeper into pleasure loving. But, said Christ, \"Behold I come as a thief.\" When the scorner, the rejecter of truth has become presumptuous, when the routine of work in the various money-making lines is being carried on without regard to principle, when the student is fully engaged in ambitious aims to obtain knowledge of everything but the Bible, Christ comes as a thief. The warning has been given, \"Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up\" [Matthew 24:42, 43]. Every hour that passes is one hour less for you to make preparation of character for this great event.--Manuscript 7a, 1896. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C.
