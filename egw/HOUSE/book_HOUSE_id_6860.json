    "word": "He who would be an effective co-worker with God in his broad vineyard must do most diligent, earnest, hard work; he must meet the people where they are. If they will not come to the gospel feast to which the call of Christ invites them, then God's messengers must accommodate themselves to the circumstances, and bear the message to them in house to house labor, thus extending their ministry to the highways and by ways, giving the last message to the world.--Letter 164, 1899. (To Edson and Emma White, October 20, 1899.) \n\nReleased May 20, 1977.",
