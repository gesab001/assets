    "word": "The movement began in the fall of 1842, and continued through the winter of 1843. An eye witness, speaking of the work accomplished through these children, says: \u201cThe weather was providentially very favorable that winter. There was little snow, but the marshes, lakes, and rivers were frozen over so that they could be used as a high-road, and the people went in masses to the places where these child-preachers were, who were mostly poor cottagers. A little girl began preaching but a few miles from the place were I lived, and as the news of the wonderful movement was noised about, I went with my wife to see and hear for myself. When we arrived at the cottage, it was filled with people. The child, who was six or eight years old, moved around among them, and they asked her questions, which she answered as a child usually does. The people flocked together, till the house was surrounded by a great number. When the last had arrived, her manner changed entirely, both in boldness and movements, clearly indicating that she \n206\nwas moved by an invisible power, and not by her own natural gifts. When she commenced speaking, her voice also changed. She said, \u2018Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his Judgment is come.\u2019 She reproved sins, such as drinking, theft, adultery, swearing, and backbiting, and also reproved churchgoers for attending church with worldly business in view, instead of listening to God's word and conforming their lives to it. Her voice and words were impressive. Many were weeping and sighing. They were told that time was given them to repent, but they must do it immediately, and not put it off.",
