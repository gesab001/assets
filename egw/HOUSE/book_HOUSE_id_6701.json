    "word": "Here was a house all furnished, and we could, as soon as the decision was made and terms accepted, go into this house, and find everything ready in excellent order to begin my home life without the perplexities of purchasing goods and furnishings for housekeeping. Here were horses, carriages, and nearly everything superior far to that which I had left, and the same price for which my home was sold will bring this beautiful, healthful residence, in good order for us to possess. . . . This manifestation in our behalf was so marked and the desirability of the location so decided I knew the Lord was granting me His rich blessing. . . . I never anticipated so much in a home that meets my tastes and my desires so perfectly. Next week we shall live in our new home, and we will seek to make it a home after the symbol of heaven. --Ms 96, 1900, pp. 11, 12.
