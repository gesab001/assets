    "word": "Build over against your own house; repent of your own sins; let the grace of Christ control these tongues that are set on fire of hell, that would fan a spark into an uncontrollable flame. Repent and be \n                                                                           19\nconverted before it shall be forever too late. You have trifled with the Spirit of God altogether too long. You have insulted the Spirit of God, and you do not know where you are. Do not find fault with any one but your own selves. Unless you overcome your disposition to accuse, to tattle, to magnify the wrongs of others, while you neglect the culture of your own soul, you will be more and more self-deceived, more blinded to the true state of your own heart, and your day of opportunity and privilege to be wise for yourselves will pass, and you will be fastened in Satan's snare for time and eternity.",
