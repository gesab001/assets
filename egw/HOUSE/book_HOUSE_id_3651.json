Attended Meeting and Entertained Company.--Sister Brackett,  Sister Lane and her daughter, Sister Scott, and Sister Smith came from Convis to the meeting at Battle Creek. They took dinner at our house. [SABBATH MEALS IN THE WHITE HOME IN LATER YEARS ARE DESCRIBED BY HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW IN A STATEMENT DATED OCTOBER 16, 1949: \n     \"AS MRS. E. G. WHITE'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW, I WAS A MEMBER OF HER HOUSEHOLD FOR A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR, AND WAS OFTEN IN HER HOME AND TRAVELLED WITH HER OVER A PERIOD OF TWENTY YEARS. I HAVE BEEN ASKED CONCERNING THE SABBATH MEALS IN THE WHITE HOME. \n     \"AS FULL PREPARATION AS WAS POSSIBLE WAS MADE ON FRIDAY, THE PREPARATION DAY, FOR THE SABBATH MEALS. ON SABBATH THE FOOD FOR BOTH BREAKFAST AND DINNER WAS SERVED HOT, IT HAVING BEEN HEATED IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE MEAL. ALL UNNECESSARY WORK WAS AVOIDED ON THE SABBATH BUT AT NO TIME DID MRS. WHITE CONSIDER IT A VIOLATION OF PROPER SABBATH OBSERVANCE TO PROVIDE FOR THE ORDINARY COMFORTS OF LIFE SUCH AS THE BUILDING OF A FIRE FOR THE HEATING OF THE HOUSE OR THE HEATING OF THE FOOD FOR THE MEALS.\"--(SIGNED) MRS. W. C. WHITE.] Meeting was interesting through the day. Brother Waggoner preached in the forenoon. His discourse was appropriate. At intermission four were baptized--Sisters Hide, Scott, and Agnes Irving, and Brother Pratt. Our afternoon meeting was very interesting. My husband never had greater liberty. The Lord's Spirit was in the meeting. The Lord gave me freedom in exhortation. In the eve the ordinances of the Lord's house were attended to. It was a solemn, interesting occasion. I was unable to attend, being much exhausted.--Manuscript 6, 1859.",
