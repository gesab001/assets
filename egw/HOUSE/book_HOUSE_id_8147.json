    "word": "The path of sincerity and integrity is not a path free from all obstruction. In the place of becoming faint-hearted and discouraged, those to whom God has entrusted responsibilities, are to see in every difficulty a call to prayer. They are to consult, not finite men, who are boastful and show a masterly independence, but the great Teacher who has given to every man his work in his vineyard. They are to be faithful workers, always in co-partnership with the great worker. Then they will not call slackly done work faithful and thorough service. They will stand fast against wrong, discerning the right from the wrong, the evil from the good. They will appreciate that which God estimates. There is no favoritism with God, and no partiality, no hypocrisy should be introduced or maintained in our households, churches, or institutions. \n\n\n                                                         E.
