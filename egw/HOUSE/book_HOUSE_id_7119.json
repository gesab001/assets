    "word": "MR No. 980 - The Need for Insurance\n\n     Brother Palmer says he has written to you in regard to the insurance. If the house is not insured, it should be at once. He says you have all the papers, and you have not answered his letter at all. If you have the insurance, they can get pay for the damage done to the house. Please attend to this immediately. Write something at once so that we may know what to do.--Letter 53, 1884, pp. 1, 2. (To Willie and Mary White, written from Syracuse, New York, August 20, 1884.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C.
