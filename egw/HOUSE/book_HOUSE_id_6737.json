    "word": "Brethren, what was it that led some of our number to question the benefit of organization? The matter has been opened before me, and the reason \n\n\n                                     -455- \n\nwas that they feared to see so much power vested in unsanctified hands. It was a foreboding that just such a condition as has come about would exist. We may well fear a direful reaction. There must be a decided change. Men must be converted, or as long as they hold power they will use it to oppress their brethren. If not converted, they must be removed.--Manuscript 11, 1895.
