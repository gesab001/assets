    "word": "Covenant at Sinai in Force Today \n\n\n     The covenant that God made with His people at Sinai is to be our refuge and defense. The Lord said to Moses: \"Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people: for all the earth is Mine: And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. . . .And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words. . . .And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do\"  (Exodus 19:3-8).",
