    "word": "Christ did not immediately reply to the woman's request. . . . But although Jesus did not reply, the  woman did not lose faith. As He passed on, as if not hearing her, she followed Him, continuing her supplications. . . . The woman urged her case with increased earnestness, bowing at Christ's feet, and crying, \"Lord, help me.\" . . . The Saviour is satisfied. He has tested her faith in Him. By His dealings with her, He has shown that she who has been regarded as an outcast from Israel is no longer an alien, but a child in God's household. As a child it is her privilege to share in the Father's gifts. Christ now grants her request, and finishes the lesson to the disciples. Turning to her with a look of pity and love, He says, \"O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.\"  From that hour her daughter became whole. The demon troubled her no more. The woman departed, acknowledging her Saviour,\n66\nand happy in the granting of her prayer.--DA 399-402 (1898).",
