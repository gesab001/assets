    "word": "Employment of Competent Men.--I have been shown that, in addition to the help now in the office, competent men should be employed to assist in the management of the different departments of the work. Men should be employed who have experience in business and who are wise managers. It would have been better years ago [WRITTEN IN 1889, THIS STATEMENT HARKS BACK TO THE TIME, \"YEARS AGO,\" WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO EMPLOY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MANAGERS--EVEN AT DOUBLE THE WAGES OF FOREMEN--RATHER THAN TO INVOLVE THE PUBLISHING HOUSE IN SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. A SPECIAL SITUATION AND EMERGENCY MAY REQUIRE A SPECIAL REMEDY.] to have employed men who were thorough managers--men who would have taught thoroughness, promptness, and economy--even if double the wages that have been paid to foreman had been necessary. Brother R is deficient here; he has not a happy way of correcting evils. He undertakes to do this, but very many things are entirely neglected that ought to be reformed at one. The office has lacked a care-taking economist, a thorough businessman. There is three times as much lost as would be required to pay for the very best talent and experience in this work.--5T 414.",
