PROVIDENTIALLY, GOD HAD BROUGHT TOGETHER AT JERUSALEM \"DEVOUT MEN OUT OF EVERY NATION UNDER HEAVEN.\" HEARING THEM SPEAK \"THE WONDERFUL WORKS OF GOD\" IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE, THEY WERE AMAZED.

IN THIS HOUSE-TO-HOUSE LABOR THEY UNDOUBTEDLY ENLISTED THE NEW CONVERTS, \"AND THE LORD ADDED TO THE CHURCH DAILY SUCH AS SHOULD BE SAVED. ACTS 2:46, 47.
