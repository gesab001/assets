    "word": "The whole natural world is designed to be an interpreter of the things of God. To Adam and Eve in their Eden home nature was full of the knowledge of God, teeming with divine instruction. To their attentive ears it was vocal with the voice of wisdom. Wisdom spoke to the eye, and was received into the heart; for they communed with God in His created works. . . . In the natural world God has placed in the hands of the children of men the key to unlock the treasure house of His Word. The unseen is illustrated by the seen; divine wisdom, eternal truth, infinite grace, are understood by the things that God has made.",
