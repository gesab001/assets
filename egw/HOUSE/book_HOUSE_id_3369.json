[SEE COUNSELS TO WRITERS AND EDITORS FOR EXPANDED TREATMENT OF THIS AND RELATED SUBJECTS.]--I would appeal to those who are responsible for the articles that are to be inserted in the columns of the Review and Herald. I would urge them to be men of caution, to be men whose spiritual eyes are anointed with holy eyesalve, that they may discern clearly what will be for the advancement, not the detriment, of the cause. If they do not walk and commune with God, let them give place to others who will walk firmly and fearfully before God in the solemn work of preparing matter for publication, which should be as meat in due season to the household of God.",
