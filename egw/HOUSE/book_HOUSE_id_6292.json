    "word": "Lost Piece of Silver. \n\n     The lost piece of silver is designed to represent the erring, straying sinner. The carefulness of the woman to find the piece of lost silver, is to teach the followers of Christ a lesson in regard to their duty to those erring and straying from the path of right. The woman lighted the candle to increase her light, and then swept the house, and sought diligently till she found it.",
