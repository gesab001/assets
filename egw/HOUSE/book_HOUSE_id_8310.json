    "word": "\"When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shephan, had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord, then he went down into the King's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there. . . . Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi. . . unto Baruch saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.",
