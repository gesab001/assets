    "word": "Brooklyn, New York, Sunday, November 16, 1890 \n\n     I spoke to a full house at eleven o'clock Sabbath a.m. with much freedom. I do not think I have ever seen a better class of people before me. There was nobility and intelligence. We had a good social meeting. Many excellent testimonies were borne.--Ms. 46, 1890, p. 3 (Diary 16, p. 315).",
