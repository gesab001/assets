    "word": "3 (Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9). Love and Talents Blended.--Pure, sanctified love, expressed by Christ's lifework, is as sacred perfume. Like an opened bottle of perfume, it fills the whole house with fragrance. Eloquence, an extended knowledge of the truth, outward devotion, rare talents, if mingled with sacred, humble love, will become as fragrant as the opened box of ointment. But gifts alone, ability alone, the choicest endowments alone, cannot take the place of love [1 Corinthians 13:1-3 quoted] (MS 22, 1897).",
