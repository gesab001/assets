McClure, California minister and friend, about her Southern travels. \nJuly 12, 1904\n     During the time that we spent in Nashville, we had many profitable counsels in regard to the work. We also spent considerable time in looking at properties for sale. On the way down the river we looked at a four-hundred-acre farm that Brother Magan and Brother Sutherland thought would be a favorable place for the training school that they wish to establish near Nashville, and the moderate sum for which it could be purchased seemed to point it out as the very place for our work here. The house is old, but it can be used until more suitable school buildings can be erected.",
