    "word": "Mighty Truths Buried Beneath Rubbish of Error \n\n\n     Mighty truths have been buried beneath the sophistry of error, but they will be found by the diligent searcher. As he finds and opens the treasure house of the precious jewels of truth, it is no robbery; for all who appreciate these jewels may possess them, and then they too have a treasure house to open to others. He who imparts does not deprive himself of the treasure; for as he examines it that he may present it in such a way as to attract others, he finds new treasures. Ms 88, 1898, p. 6.
