    "word": "Just as soon as you begin to think you are big men, and that you are so large that you can comprehend and pick out all that is precious in infidel authors, and leave out all that is vile, then you are wise above that which is written. You cannot do this. The devil is right by your side, and the evil angels are there. The devil is a great deal smarter than you are, and you cannot see what he is driving at. He will so cunningly interweave his sentiments with the thoughts of these writers, so that it will be impossible to distinguish the error which they contain. He regards this circumstance as his opportunity. These very things may insinuate themselves into your mind and character, and God pronounces you a fool. That is just how it is. If you want to be counted a fool in God's sight, it is very easy for you to do it, but if you want to be counted a wise man in God's eyes, come right to the cross of Calvary, and get the inspiration that comes from it, and your name will be written as a wise man who built his house upon the rock, and the storms came and \"the winds blew,and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock\" (Matthew 7:25).",
