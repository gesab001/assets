    "word": "A Call to Greater Self-Denial \n\n     It is our privilege to see the work of God advancing in the cities. Christ is waiting, waiting, for places to be entered. Who are preparing for this work? We shall not say that we are destitute of laborers. There are some workers, and for this we are glad. But there is a greater, a far greater work to be done in our cities. Far greater self-denial is to be practiced in order that the word of life may be carried from place to place and from house to house.",
