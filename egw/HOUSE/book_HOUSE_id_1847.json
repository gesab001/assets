    "word": "Many are now perishing for want of knowledge. Shall we not give mind and soul and voice to proclaiming the truth as it is in Christ Jesus? To every worker I would say, Show to unbelievers that there is strength in God. Communicate your ideas in regard to what is required, by the words of warning, \u201cPrepare to meet thy God!\u201d Sow the seeds of truth by all waters. Wake up the watchmen, and, with them, bear the message in words of power. \u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d The increase of your own experience will be proportionate to your individual trust and confidence in God.",
