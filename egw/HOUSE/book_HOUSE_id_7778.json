    "word": "I remember thirty-six years ago, I was in New York, in the house of Brother Abbey. A man came in there with an umbrella in his hands, and there \n\n\n                                     -23- \n\nhe stood and said, \"I am Christ.\" I had looked upon Christ, and I said to him, \"Sir, you have no part with Christ. If you were Christ you would never have uttered that sentence.\" He raised his umbrella to strike me, but my husband stepped in between him and me, and said to him, \"What are you going to do sir?\" He said, \"I am Christ, and will execute His will upon those that dispute His claims.\"",
