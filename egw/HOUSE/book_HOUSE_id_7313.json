Then the gifts will have come from me, \n\n\n                                -340- \n\nand not from him. The money was given by him to be used until he called for it. Every dollar of personal donation in my own behalf, I have invested in meetinghouses and in advancing the work in different lines. I have invested no less than $500 that have been sent to me as a personal donation to be used for myself. Not one dollar of it have I used for my own personal interest.",
