    "word": "Faithfulness in Tithes and Offerings \n\n\n     The question is asked, \"Will a man rob God?\" And the answer might be given: \"Yes, Lord. Some whom Thou hast honored, and given a place in Thy work, have been engaged in robbing Thee for years. They have indulged themselves, and have centered the good things of life upon themselves, and have refused to act their part in fulfilling the requirements of God.\" \"Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee?\" Now listen, for God is speaking to you out of His Word. \"In tithes and offerings.\" How does God regard the robbery of His treasury? Listen: \n                                                                           62\n\"Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed Me, even this whole nation.\" Hear the words of the most high God, you who have been robbing God: \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house\"--not a meager portion, not one half, or one quarter, but \"all the tithes, . . . that there may be meat in Mine house.\" The reason is so plain that it commends itself to everyone who has been cherishing the hateful plant of selfishness,--\"that there may be meat in Mine house.\" The reason that the Lord wants all the tithes in the treasury is that there may not be a scarcity of funds when His providence opens new fields to be occupied by the messengers of truth, that souls as precious in the sight of God as your own may come into the knowledge of the true God and Jesus Christ, whom He hath sent, and in their turn become missionaries to the souls of others.",
