    "word": "I saw the situation of things, slipped my feet from the stirrup, and was just ready to slip from the saddle to the ground and in one moment should have been safe. But the pony was frightened and threw me over his back. I struck my back and my head. I knew I was badly hurt, but felt assured no bones were broken. I could scarcely breathe or talk for some time but finally improved a little. . . . I was placed upon a bed in the wagon and rode thus a few miles, till we came to the mountain, then mounted my pony. Weak and full of pain, I rode up mountains as steep as the roof of a house, over rocky hills and big boulders that seemed impossible to pass. We camped at night, and bathed. I wore a wet bandage, and although in considerable pain, I rested well on the ground in camp and the next morning was upon my saddle again.--Letter 14, 1872. (To \"Dear Children, Edson and Emma.\")",
