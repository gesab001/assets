    "word": "Such a masterly confederacy united to carry things its own way that a work entirely human has been mingled with the handling of sacred things. Each felt pledged to sustain and work for the interest of the other. A system of robbery toward God was brought in. \"Shall I not judge for these things?\" God asks. The Lord has opened the matter to me, and my heart has burned with indignation. Light has been given that the Lord would in His own time make these men a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. Letter 26, 1897, (To a Worker in the Publishing House, December 10, 1897.)",
