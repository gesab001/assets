    "word": "We need now as never before to call attention to the words, \"Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.\" What the Lord inscribed upon His temple was in perfect harmony with His plan. His invitation is to go forth to all places of the earth.

And let the whole earth be filled with Thy glory.",
