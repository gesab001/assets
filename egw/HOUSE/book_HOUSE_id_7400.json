    "word": "In Hamilton, where the camp meeting was held, we contemplate building a meetinghouse. The ground is purchased but there must be no debt on the place. Therefore we wait for the Lord to open the way. He will do this. His promise is as good as a deed. A portion of the money is already raised. I gave fifty pounds to the Brisbane church and another fifty to the church in Hamilton. When we receive money we will commence to build a humble house of worship. Just now, in midwinter, the people have to meet under a tent that has no flooring. They have no other place in which to assemble.",
