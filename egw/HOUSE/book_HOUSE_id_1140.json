    "word": "An expensive building has been rented in Iowa Circle, Washington [D. C.].  It is a beautiful location for a sanitarium and has been fitted up for the giving of treatment, but it needs a house physician and a manager.  We need you.  We believe that you can help us in Washington.  You can give the nurses the instruction that they need and can also give lectures in the parlor to the patients.  Will you receive this invitation as prompted by the Lord?  I have an assurance that you can do the work essential.  Brother Hare is an excellent physician, but not a manager.  We need someone who can plan and manage.  You can help us out of our difficulty.  Washington is a most important place, and a right representation of our work must be given by the sanitarium.",
