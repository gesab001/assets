    "word": "I have been instructed that it is not extravagant display which is now to be regarded as one of the best means of giving the last message of mercy to our world. We must go forth in the simplicity of true godliness. Our sanitariums, our schools, our publishing houses, are to be God's instrumentalities to represent the humble manner of Christ's teaching. In a marked manner the Lord will be the strength and power and verity of the truth for this time. Maintain simplicity and pray in faith constantly. Wherever you are, your only safety is prayer. In living faith claim the promises. Hold fast the beginning of your confidence firm unto the end.",
