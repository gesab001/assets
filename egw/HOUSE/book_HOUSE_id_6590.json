    "word": "A man and his sister lived in the house joined to this barn--for universally the barn is one-half of the house. The smallest half is the dwelling part for the family. These two, brother and sister, are strong Catholics and they are devoted to the Catholic religion, but they treated us with the greatest courtesy. They wanted to make us a dish of coffee or tea, or serve us with cake and wine, but all this was declined. They urged us to come into the family rooms, but I could sit in the carriage and look out through the large open doors and see the showers of hail and I did not wish to go into the house where I would be deprived of this sight. . . . We gathered up handfuls of the hail and ate them.",
