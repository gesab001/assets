    "word": "Beginning at Basel, Elder Conradi gathered a group of six or eight young people, and began to train them for success. He declared that the people needed the saving truths in our books; that Mrs. White said that with well trained effort these books could be sold; that Elder Matteson had proved this true; and that he and his young associates must find the way. They studied their book until they were enthusiastic about its great truths, and then as they went out under his encouragement and instruction, they met with success. [NOTE.--AT THE GENERAL CONFERENCE OF 1887 IT WAS STATED: \"THE PUBLISHING WORK AT BASEL HAS STEADILY INCREASED. FROM THE VERY FIRST, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT OUR PUBLICATIONS MUST ACT A LEADING PART IN THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN FIELD. THE DENOMINATIONAL BOOKS, TRACTS, AND PERIODICALS ISSUED IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES ARE HAVING A POWERFUL INFLUENCE FOR GOOD WHEREVER THEY ARE CIRCULATED.\" (S. D. A. YEAR BOOK, 1888, P. 120.) \n     SO PROSPERED WERE THE WORKERS FOR THE LARGER BOOKS AND FOR THE PERIODICALS PUBLISHED AT THE IMPRIMERIE POLYGLOTTE, THAT IN 1889 ELDER O. A. OLSEN WAS ABLE TO REPORT A SUBSTANTIAL GAIN IN ITS OPERATION. \"THE PUBLISHING HOUSE AT BASEL . . . HAS DONE A GOOD BUSINESS THE PAST YEAR,\" HE DECLARED TO THE DELEGATES ASSEMBLED AT THE 1889 GENERAL CONFERENCE. \"THE ANNUAL REPORT SHOWS A GAIN OF $1,559.55 FOR THE YEAR. WHEN WE CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THIS OFFICE HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN SELF-SUSTAINING, THIS REPORT IS VERY ENCOURAGING. THE AGGRESSIVE WORK OF THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN CONFERENCE THIS YEAR HAS BEEN LARGELY IN THE DIRECTION OF GERMANY.\" (GENERAL CONFERENCE DAILY BULLETIN, 1889, P. 3.)] \n                                                                           288",
