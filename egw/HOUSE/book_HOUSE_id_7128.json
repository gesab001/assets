    "word": "Mrs. Gorick is keeping the Sabbath. One of her neighbors, a member of the High Church, wished her to meet Cardinal Moran at her house, and she consented to do so. When he came in, the lady of the house fell on her knees before him, and kissed first one hand and then the other. This both astonished and disgusted Mrs. Gorick. She was then introduced to him. He began questioning her, and entered into conversation with her, giving a lengthy talk in regard to the church and its delegated power and authority. He then spoke of a very desirable piece of land they were anxious to purchase, telling her that he thought Mr. Gorick could in some way secure this land for them without letting the owners know for what purpose it was to be used. He asked her if they could not help them. She told him that they were deciding to unite with the Seventh-day Adventists, and would help them build a church. She had accepted the seventh-day Sabbath, she said, which was the Sabbath of the Bible. The first day was not the Sabbath.",
