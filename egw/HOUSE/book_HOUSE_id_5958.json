    "word": "All over the land are the houses of the publican, the places of the liquor vendors,--death-traps, where not only men but youth and children are taken captive by the enemy of souls. The law professes to restrict the work of the liquor-seller by providing that when a man reaches a certain state of inebriety, he is to be denied \n                                                                           6\ndrink. But who is to judge as to when one has reached the stage where it is unsafe for him to drink more? This is left to the man who is making gain by the weakness of his wretched victim. And there is no law against making our youth into drunkards. The law permits the liquor-vendors to lead them down step by step, until the liquor habit is established, and the young men are drunkards. Better, far better, would it be to give the liquor to the poor, confirmed drunkard who has already been ruined, than to take the very flower of the country and city, and educate our youth in these dreadful habits. Do not the law-makers understand what they will become,--poor inebriates, ruined in body and soul? O, what a terrible condition our world is in!",
