    "word": "But although John dwells so particularly on love, he does not clasp hands with sin. Hear his words regarding the apostate from the faith, he who has had a knowledge of the truth but has departed from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits. \"Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: for he that biddeth him Godspeed is partaker of his evil deeds.\" Let all consider this.",
