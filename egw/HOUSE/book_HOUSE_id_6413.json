    "word": "I understand that you have not seen this property at Sonoma. It is a large tract of land, on which stands a large, beautiful building called \"The Castle.\" The building has three stories and basement, with twelve spacious rooms on each floor. The property is a mile or two from the town of Sonoma, and some distance from any house. I have paid one visit to this place, but at that time could not go farther than the second floor. I hope to visit it again as soon as the brethren have secured the abstract, giving them the right to take possession. Then I hope to drive over from St. Helena to Buena Vista and spend some time there. . . .",
