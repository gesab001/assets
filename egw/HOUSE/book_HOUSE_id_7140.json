    "word": "The Stanmore Church Dedicated--Since the camp meeting held at Stanmore last November, a meetinghouse, so constructed that it will hold 600 people, has been erected in that suburb. As a fruit of the work done in that place, 75 souls have taken their position to obey the commandments of God.

Afterward, when we had decided that we must build, several of these doubled their donation.",
