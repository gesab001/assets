    "word": "\"Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread. And He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a share to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.\" \"Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.\"",
