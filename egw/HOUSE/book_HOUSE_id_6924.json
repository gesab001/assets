    "word": "Elder Olsen, we feel deeply in regard to our ministers. In the last mail I wrote you something in regard to Elder C. We all feel greatly relieved that he is no longer in Australia. The church in Adelaide where Brother C made his home, has been strangely neglected. The man devoted much of his time to his own enterprises, and took no care of the church. The sick were not visited, the desponding were not comforted, and the influence of this neglect is now \n\n\n                                    -453- \n\nfelt by us who are here. Yesterday Elder [G.C.] Tenney read me a letter from a brother in Adelaide, in whom all have confidence, which set forth the condition of things. His course in money matters has been very much after the order that D pursued.
