    "word": "Hillcrest, a Training-School for Colored \n                Workers \n\n\n     Let us thank God that the colored people have a school farm near Nashville. Day before yesterday I had the privilege of visiting the Hillcrest School, and of seeing the little houses that they have been putting up for the accommodation of a few students. A sister has recently sent them money sufficient to build a modest little cottage. In this gift the managers of the school see an evidence of God's favoring hand. The Lord is indeed moving upon the hearts of his people, and leading them to aid in the establishment of training-centers for the education of colored youth to labor among their own race. Hillcrest is a beautiful property, and gives opportunity to provide for many to receive a training for service. Let us thank God for this, and take courage.",
