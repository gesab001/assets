    "word": "Christian Intercourse. \n\n     In all their intercourse with others, the followers of Christ should seek to elevate the standard of Christianity. I have hesitated to speak upon this point, because some who are ever ready to go to extremes will conclude that in order to elevate the standard, it is necessary to discuss with the patients upon points of doctrine, and in the religious meetings held at the Sanitarium, to talk as they would if among their brethren in our own house of worship. Some manifest no wisdom in bearing their testimony in these little meetings designed more especially for the benefit of the patients, but rush on in their zeal, and talk of the third angel's message, or other peculiar points of our faith, while these sick people understand no more what they are talking about than if they spoke in Greek.",
