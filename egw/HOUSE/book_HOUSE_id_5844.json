ANOTHER TRACT OF FIFTY-FIVE ACRES, LYING EAST OF PEPPER DRIVE FROM THE RAILROAD TO THE BRIDGE, INCLUDING THE ORANGE ORCHARD AND HOUSE, WAS HELD AT $20,000. THE NEXT TRACT, TWENTY-SEVEN ACRES, LYING EAST OF PEPPER DRIVE, RUNNING FROM THE CREEK TO COLTON AVENUE, WAS HELD AT $2,250. ANOTHER THREE-CORNER TRACT OF ABOUT TWENTY ACRES, LYING NORTH OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY, EXTENDING TO THE EASTERN LINE OF THE THIRTY ACRES THAT WE PURCHASED ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE RAILWAY, WAS OFFERED US FOR $750. THIS TWENTY-ACRE PIECE I URGED ONE OF OUR BRETHREN TO PURCHASE AND HOLD FOR US, BUT BECAUSE OF THE CRITICISMS AND MISGIVINGS REGARDING WHAT HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE IN SECURING THE PLACE, NOTHING WAS DONE. AND SO FAR AS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF THE OTHER PIECES OF PROPERTY, IT SEEMED ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.",
