    "word": "The Lord expects all, by acts of self-denial, to help in the upbuilding of His work. In the house of worship to be erected and the additional schoolrooms that will be needed, let all be willing to do their best, willing to deny themselves the unnecessary expenditures for display, that they may have means to give to the cause of God. The work in promulgating the principles of health reform, which the Lord has outlined to us, must be accomplished. When we study the self-denial of Christ, and make his life our example, truth and righteousness will prevail among us. We will esteem as of highest value the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great value. \n\n\n                                 (signed) Ellen G.
