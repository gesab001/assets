    "word": "We arrived safely and were pleasantly located in two good hired rooms, richly furnished with plush chairs and sofas. Willie's room was next to ours but it did not look just in place to pile all our trunks and bundles in these nicely furnished room. We had to walk a few rods to our meals. We decided to find other rooms and we found rooms in the boarding house, hired for that purpose, and we have, Sarah and I, one room, plainly furnished, but it has the blessings of a fire place which is of value you well know to me. Will has a chamber above with stove in his room. Two brethren sleep in a bed in the same room. Then they have a small room for to do their writing in, and Willie is just as pleased with this as he can be.",
