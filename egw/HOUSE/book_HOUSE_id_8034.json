    "word": "August 28. Last Friday Emily and I rode over to the school buildings and took dinner with them. On the way we looked at buildings to see if they would serve us, but all [were] unfavorable, sunless, or wedged in with \n                                                                           998\nother buildings. We had others still to visit when the storm struck us. (It was) a severe spurt of hail storm, so we made our way about one mile to the school and I was carried in a chair by three men up to Elder Starr's room. We met Willie there at two o'clock and we went again in search of houses. We could spend but little time and it was a failure--no house for us. Everything that is desirable will cost us from thirty to forty dollars per month. We are seeking the Lord most earnestly for Him to guide us with His counsel and give us grace to do His will. We want to be just where the Lord would have us to be. Were it not for the school, I would not go through the process of moving, for we are pleasantly situated; but there is an urgent desire expressed that we be near the school building that I can, as my strength will permit, give the students short talks. I know this is best, and therefore I desire to do this.",
