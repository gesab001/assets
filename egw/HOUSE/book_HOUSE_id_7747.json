    "word": "We reached this place, Sands, Virginia, about twelve o'clock. The train is usually due about eleven o'clock. We found Brother Lewis, who lives within three miles of Washington [Virginia], waiting with team for us. We rode out one mile. Brother Robinson and Willie White walked. Close by the meeting house which was built for our people was a building owned by Brother Painter. It was at this time vacant, and the brethren moved into it to entertain those who came. We have very good accommodations but in marked contrast to the ample and abundant rooms in Salamanca. We seldom find ourselves so well situated in our travels as we did at Brother Hicks'. We have not a thing to complain of, for the Lord's people here are doing their very best and we are fully satisfied.--Ms. 45, 1890, pp. 1-2 (Diary 16, pp. 290-291).",
