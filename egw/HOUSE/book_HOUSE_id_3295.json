    "word": "Fewer Overseers--More Faithful Doers.--The superintendent of the publishing house is a watchman, to guard its interests. In order that he may do this, he must not have various other responsibilities placed upon him. Brethren, you should lighten the burdens that Brother Jones [C. H. JONES WAS FOR ABOUT FIFTY YEARS MANAGER OF THE PACIFIC PRESS. HE WAS APPOINTED AS ONE OF THE FIRST TRUSTEES OF THE ELLEN G. WHITE ESTATE BOARD.] is carrying outside the office. He is only a mortal man, and if he does his duty fully in the office, he has all that one man can possibly attend to. Without faithful supervision from \n\n136 \n\nhim, some things will not receive the attention that they should have, and will go sadly wrong. Be careful how you place work upon him relative to the burdens of the church. He should have one to stand by his side who is reliable, devoted, and God-fearing, that nothing connected with the office may be neglected. But men have been placed in charge of the work at the office who act more as overseers than as interested, unselfish workers. If there were fewer overseers, and more faithful doers of the work, there would be a marked improvement in the managing force in the office. If Brother Jones has for his co-workers mere overseers, who shun work, choosing to tell others what to do, he might better stand alone.--MS 14, 1891. (SpTWWPP 21.)",
