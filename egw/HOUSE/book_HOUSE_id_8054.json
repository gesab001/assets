Z., Tuesday, April 18, 1893 \n\n\n     The weather is cloudy and very mild. This place is reported to be a windy place usually, but there is no wind now. We are much pleased with our temporary home here. I have two excellent rooms, thoroughly furnished. Sister Tuxford has furnished the house with all necessary furniture. There are easy chairs in abundance and a good sofa, tables and many things attractive. Sister Tuxford is the only one who is working and bearing the responsibilities--which are not light nor small--in this mission. She is a business woman and capable, pleasant, and active.",
