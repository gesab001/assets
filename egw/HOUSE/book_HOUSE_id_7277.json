    "word": "Christ rebuked the Pharisees and doctors of the law because of the dishonest practices which they had brought into the temple courts. These men influenced the buyers and sellers to purchase cattle at the lowest prices, and then to sell them for a high price to those coming from a distance, who could not bring their offerings with them and were therefore compelled to buy them in Jerusalem. As these men sat at the table, counting the money they had gained by robbery and extortion, Christ stood before them. His eyes flashed with indignation as He saw the fraudulent transactions which were carried on. Picking up a scourge of small cords, which had been used to drive cattle to the temple, He drove out those who sold and bought, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, saying \"It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\"",
