    "word": "We left Huntsville on Wednesday afternoon, and reached Nashville at seven on the evening of the same day. Since our return we have been looking for places suitable for sanitarium work. Yesterday evening Edson and Emma and I rode out to see a place about five miles from Nashville. It is an old-time plantation. There are 385 acres in the property. The house is a large, brick one, and stands in one of the most beautiful groves of trees I have ever seen. It would be an excellent place for a camp meeting. But we are quite decided that it is not suitable for sanitarium purposes. A great many changes would have to be made in the house to adapt it to our work. Besides this, part of the land is bottom land, very low, and at certain seasons of the year is covered with water. The river runs on two sides of the property. We do not think that it would be wisdom to pay thirty thousand dollars for this place.",
