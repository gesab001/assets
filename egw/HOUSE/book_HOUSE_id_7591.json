    "word": "The second or third night I dreamed of having the care of a child that was weak and seemed unable to rally. I thought the same physician stood by the cradle and said, \"Have you any wine in the house? Beat up a raw egg, and give it to the child with grape wine, three times each day. He will rally.\" Dr. Lay came the next morning, and said he must return to the sanitarium the next morning, that the erysipelas was conquered but that he was extremely weak. \"I am perplexed to know what to do.\" I told him my dream, and he went immediately and gave him the strengthening potion. He gained strength rapidly. This occurred when Willie was about twelve years old.",
