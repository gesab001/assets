    "word": "You are anxious to obtain labor in your locality, hoping that something can be said or done to awaken your children. You have neglected your duty. When you take up the long-neglected work which the Lord has left for you to do; when you, with the spirit of Christ, resolutely arouse yourself to set your house in order, then you may hope that God will aid your efforts and impress the hearts of your family. While you have made your children an excuse for your remaining at home, you have not done the work for which you pleaded to stay at home. You have not disciplined your children. Your wife is deficient in this respect, therefore there is the greater need that you be in a position to do your duty. Her love is of that kind which will lead her to indulge them in doing as they please and in choosing their own society, which will lead to their ruin. Your presence at home, while you allow your children to do as they please, is worse for your family than if you were away from them; and it has a worse influence upon the cause of truth. \n                                                                           628",
