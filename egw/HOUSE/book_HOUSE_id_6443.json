    "word": "We had an invitation from the son of Sister Doerner to take dinner at his house. A hack took us to the place, a sister of Brother Doerner accompanying us. We had gone but a few rods when the hack lurched to one side and came up against the curbing of the sidewalk and the horse, with the thills, was separated from the hack. We were soon out. The only trouble was that someone had failed to put in the linchpins, that held the thills to the hack. Nothing \n\n\n                                    -129- \n\nwas broken and we went on without further trouble. The wife of Brother Doerner met us at the gate. She is a pleasant looking little woman with three little children. She is the daughter of Brother Linderman, one who has kept the Sabbath twenty-five or thirty years. He is still living. He is eighty-three years old and is a second child. It is through his influence that the Doerner family received the Sabbath. There are three brothers, Doerners, believing the truth. They are in company ownership of a large manufacturing establishment in which cloth and cotton goods are made. It is a large building and a large business. The brother lives in this establishment where we were visiting. He has large grounds and trees and flowers. He is very pleasantly situated. This brother was the last to accept the Sabbath. One brother, the eldest of the three, is lying at the point of death with cancer of the throat. It is a great affliction to his family, none of whom are keeping the Sabbath.",
