    "word": "Go out for the lost sheep of the house of Israel. If there is any point on which you have committed one wrong, although they may have committed one hundred, take that which you have done out of the way, and open the way for them \n\n\n                                  -282- \n\nto come back again. Perhaps that was the very thing that was keeping a soul away. In your humility confess your one wrong, and perhaps it may touch him and lead him with weeping to confess his hundred wrongs, and to take them out of the way. Thus a soul for whom Christ died will be saved.",
