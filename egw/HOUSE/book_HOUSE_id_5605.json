    "word": "Women Called to Be Messengers of Mercy.--We greatly need consecrated women who, as messengers of mercy, will visit the mothers and the children in their homes and help them in the everyday household duties, if need be, before beginning to talk to them regarding the truth for this time. You will find that by this method you will have souls as the result of your ministry.--Review and Herald, July 12, 1906.",
