    "word": "We need help for the work to be done in different parts of the great missionary field. In Portland, Maine, where the truth was preached with power in 1842-44, our brethren and sisters have need of a little meetinghouse. Very little labor has been given to the city of Portland. There are a few Sabbath-keepers there, but they have no house of worship. We do not hesitate to ask you to help in the erection of this house of worship by giving us of your means, for by so doing you will be laying up in the heavens a treasure that faileth not. We want you to have a part in carrying the message of mercy to this world.",
