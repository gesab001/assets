Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee. And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge\u201d (verses 10-12). \u201cIf thou at all take thy neighbour\u2019s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: for that is his covering only . . . : wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious\u201d (Exodus 22:26, 27). \u201cIf thou sell aught unto thy neighbour, or buyest aught of thy neighbour\u2019s hand, ye shall not oppress one another\u201d (Leviticus 25:14).",
