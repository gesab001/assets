    "word": "Especially give heed to these words: \"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it \n\n\n                        -20- \n\nfell, and great was the fall of it.\" Many houses now supposed to stand secure will fall. The Lord declares that he will not accept divided service.",
