    "word": "Your writings, I presume, are just as they should be; yet it may be necessary that they should go through the process of being examined carefully and critically. If no fault can be found with them, they should receive the notice and the commendation that is due to such class of work. You are dealing strong blows against tradition and errors that lie at the foundation of a heresy that will destroy the souls of those who receive it. A wide door to destruction is open to all those who believe in the immortality of the soul, and do not believe that Christ alone brings life and immortality to light. I believe the book you have written will do good in enlightening many who are in darkness; but for all this, my brother, you surely can see that barriers have to be erected in our publishing houses concerning this bookmaking business. You can see that if no measures were taken to bind about this line of work, very singular productions would be poured upon the world under the endorsement of our offices of publication. . . .",
