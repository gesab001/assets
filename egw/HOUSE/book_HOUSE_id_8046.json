    "word": "God designs that all who are laborers together with him should have a rich experience in his love and his power to save. Never should we say, \"I have no experience;\" for that God who gave Paul an experience will reveal himself to every soul who will earnestly seek him. What said God of Abraham? \"I know him,\" said the heart-searching God, \"that he will command his children and his household after him; and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\" Abraham would cultivate home religion, and the fear of the Lord would lead to integrity of life. He who blesses the habitation of the righteous says, \"I know him that he will command.\" There is no betraying of sacred trusts, no hesitating between right and wrong. The Holy One has given rules for the guidance of all,---the standard of character from which none can swerve and be guiltless. God's will is to be diligently and conscientiously studied, and it must be made paramount in all the affairs of life. The laws which every human agent is to obey flow from the heart of infinite love.",
