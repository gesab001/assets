    "word": "We were much disappointed to see what meager arrangements had been made to bring the truth before the people of this large city. The meetinghall consisted of a suite of chambers in the second story of a private dwelling. As in many private houses in Sweden, the entrance was at the rear of the building. The principal room would accommodate about fifty persons, and the two smaller ones, opening one into the other from this, would seat twenty each. All were furnished with board benches, without backs. We had two evening meetings. At the first I spoke from the words, \u201cIf any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me;\u201d and at the second, upon the work of preparation to meet our Saviour, my text being, \u201cWatch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\u201d The rooms were crowded to their utmost capacity. The Lord helped me to speak, and hearts were reached, I know, by the starting tears, and the look of interest on many faces. I will do my part faithfully in bringing the light before the people. If my brethren neglect their duty, the responsibility will be theirs, not mine.",
