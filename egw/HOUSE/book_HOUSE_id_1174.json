    "word": "A woman who has been taught to take care of herself is also fitted to take care of others.  She will never be a drug [a drag or burden] in the family or in society.  When fortune frowns, there will be a place for her somewhere, a place where she can earn an honest living, and assist those who are dependent upon her.  Woman should be trained to some business whereby she can gain a livelihood if necessary. Passing over other honorable employments, every girl should learn to take charge of the domestic affairs of home, should be a cook, a housekeeper, a seamstress.  She should understand all those things which it is necessary that the mistress of a house should know, whether her family is rich or poor.  Then, if reverses come, she is prepared for any emergency; she is, in a manner, independent of circumstances.--HR, Dec. 1, 1877.",
