    "word": "The look of dejection on Peter's face suggested to the woman the thought that this was one of the disciples of Christ. She was one of the servants of Caiaphas' household, and was curious to know. She said to Peter, \"Art thou not also one of this Man's disciples?\" [John 18:17]. Peter was startled and confused; the eyes of the company instantly fastened upon him. He pretended not to understand her, but she was persistent, and said to those around her that this man was with Jesus. Peter felt compelled to answer, and said angrily, \"Woman, I know Him not\" [Luke 22:57]. This was the first denial, and immediately the cock crew. Oh, Peter! so soon ashamed of thy Master! so soon to cowardly deny thy Lord! The Saviour is dishonored and deserted in His humiliation by one of His most zealous disciples.",
