    "word": "While the tract and missionary society has its work to do, it is not to hold itself \"exclusively.\" It is not to be a separate kingdom, and have a jurisdiction of its own. From the light which God has given me, He desires that His people shall improve every opportunity for disseminating light. They are to sow beside all waters. Our publications should be represented by the office in the city. It should be well supplied with tracts and publications for use at once. Many through curiosity will desire to know what these tracts and pamphlets contain, and if they are right at hand they can be sold and the money used to carry forward the work of God for which the office is to be used. In any case, they should not wait to refer to the International Tract and Missionary Society. [NAME GIVEN TO EARLY BOOK AND BIBLE HOUSES OR ADVENTIST BOOK CENTERS.]",
