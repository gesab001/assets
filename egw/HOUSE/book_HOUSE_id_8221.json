    "word": "Your mind must be a treasure house, full of good things. Keep the patients cheerful. Pleasant words of instruction may be given to them that will be a blessing to them while they are at the sanitarium; and when they return to their homes, the message of truth they have heard will be constantly repeating itself to them. We do not appreciate how far greater are the results for good when we bring cheerfulness and the joy of the Lord into our work.",
