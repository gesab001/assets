He spoke to him, saying, \"Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward\" [Genesis 15:1]. Again, when Abraham was 99 years old, the Lord appeared to him, and said, \"I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make My covenant between Me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
