    "word": "North Fitzroy, August 30, 1892 \nElder Uriah Smith Battle Creek, Michigan \n\nDear Brother: \n\n\n     I am deeply interested that in every move you make, you should have the Lord with you. God bestows upon His people great blessings in giving them faithful, upright ministers. In all ages He has wrought through human instrumentalities to give decided messages of warning to His people, that they may be aroused and convicted of their sins, and be led to repent and reform. But at the very time when He is thus empowering men by His Holy Spirit to cry aloud, to spare not, to lift up the voice like a trumpet, and to show His people their transgressions and the house of Jacob their sins, there are \n\n146. \n\nother influences at work to counteract the work of God through His appointed agencies. There are those to whom this Scripture is applicable, \"They have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.\" . . .",
