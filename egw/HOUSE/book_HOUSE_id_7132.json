    "word": "It now becomes necessary to build a house of worship for the Stanmore believers. This will serve also for the Sabbathkeepers in Newtown, who now meet in a hall. We see that the land is going to cost us as much as the meetinghouse, 600 pounds. If this house could be erected now, the new believers would have a place where they could worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. Some of the most reliable families are now hanging in the balances, uncertain whether to obey the light and risk the consequences. We greatly desire that these souls shall venture everything for the truth's sake.",
