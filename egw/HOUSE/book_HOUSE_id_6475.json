    "word": "Bismarck, Tasmania, April 26 and May 1, 1895. Last Tuesday [April 23] Brother Lacey, May Lacey, Willie White and I came eight miles from Brother Lacey's home to this place, right in \"the bush,\" as it is called here. In America we call it the forest. This place is right up in the mountains. In appearance it is very much like Colorado, with its hills and mountains and valleys, and there are houses and small farms of cultivated lands right in the forests. The heavy timbers have been cut away and the underbrush cleared out and orchards have been planted.",
