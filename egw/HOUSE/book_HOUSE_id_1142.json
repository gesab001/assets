    "word": "Hold Smaller Meetings When Large Effort Is Finished.--The tent has been taken down, and Brother Colcord is holding meetings in a small hall connected with the house in which the mission family live. Brother and Sister James from Ballarat [Australia] have charge of the mission home. They both labor as they can to instruct the people. Sisters Wilson and Robertson have been and are doing a good work in Maitland [Australia]. The Lord sustains them, and they have many friends. In the past they have had to walk three and four miles to give their [Bible] readings, but now they have a horse and buggy.--KC 129 (1900).",
