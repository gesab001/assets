    "word": "Meditations Through Days of Affliction \n  Prayer and Anointing--but Not Instantly Healed \n\n\n     May 21, 1892. The trying, almost sleepless night is ended. Yesterday afternoon Elder [A. G.] Daniells and his wife, Elder [G. C.] Tenney and his wife, and Brethren Stockton and Smith came to our house at my request to pray that the Lord would heal me. We had a most earnest season of prayer, and we were all much blessed. I was relieved, but not restored. I have now done all that I can to follow the Bible directions, and I shall wait for the Lord to work, believing that in His own good time He will heal me. My faith takes hold of the promise, \"Ask, and ye shall receive\" (John 16:24).",
