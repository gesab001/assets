    "word": "Haphazard Work Not Acceptable.--Haphazard work in the home will not pass the review in the judgment. Faith and works are to be combined by Christian parents. As Abraham commanded his household after him, so they are to command their households after them. The standard which every parent must raise is given: \"They shall keep the way of the Lord.\" Every other way is a path which leads, not to the city of God, but to the ranks of the destroyer.",
