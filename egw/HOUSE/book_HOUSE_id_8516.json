Underwood, \n     2718 3rd Avenue, So., \n     Minneapolis, Minn. \n\nDear Brother Underwood:-- \n     I am instructed to say to our people that when special advantages are offered for doing quickly and at a small expense a work that it is time for us to do, such as were recently offered in the school buildings near Chamberlain, S.D., that those who meet in Council and stand in positions of responsibility should be ready to accept them; for these are the Lord's openings for the rapid advancement of his work. Here was an opportunity for quick work that was neglected because of lack of faith and largeness of heart. I am more sorry for this than I can express. Such opportunities are given us that we may be enabled to carry out the commission Christ gave to his first disciples, \"Go ye into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.\" This message, which means so much to all people, is to reach out to highways and hedges. I fear that a door has been closed, an opportunity neglected, that will result in the loss of souls.",
