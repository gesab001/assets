    "word": "In the morning a fire is kindled in the stove, which is built in the house of manufactured material. The surface looks like porcelain, white as milk and highly polished. These reach to the top of the room and a fire is made in them as in a fireplace. The draft at the top is opened. The doors are opened and we have a bright, cheerful fire which throws out its heat into the room. When the wood is burned down to a coal, then the draft is closed, the doors are closed, and this whole structure becomes warm and remains warm all through the day. At seven o'clock we were brought a cup of hot water and milk and bread. \n\n\n                                     -385-",
