    "word": "I was most astonished to read a letter from Sr. Amadon--a collection of partial disclosures, and dark hints of terrible things that could not be revealed. Then she remarks: \"Sr. White, be careful how you slay.\" As though God's messenger was doing a work independent of the Spirit of God! Thus Ahab thought when he met Elijah, and said, \"Art thou he that troubleth Israel?\" Elijah throws back the imputation firmly and decidedly: \"I have not troubled Israel; but thou and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of God, and thou hast followed Baalim.\" Those who bear the warnings of God, are often regarded as the offending party, whereas, the whole blame rests with those who have alienated themselves from the Lord by transgression. Elijah does not offer one excuse for his work. He does not prophesy smooth things, neither does he try to conceal the real cause of the judgments of God.",
