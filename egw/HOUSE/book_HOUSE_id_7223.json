    "word": "I saw [that] God gave Brother A a dream which, if he had followed, he would have been with you in your wife's distress; and if Brother B had not been with him he would have gone to God alone, and he would have seen by the dream and by the drawings of the Spirit that he must come directly to your house when Satan had gotten your wife in his grasp, and by faith in God would have wrenched her from the power of the enemy. But he leaned upon Brother B some for duty and followed his impressions instead of the light God gave him in the dream.",
