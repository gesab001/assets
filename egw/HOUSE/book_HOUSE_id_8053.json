I have been urging the people in Battle Creek and others, where they have established meeting houses and institutions to give character to the work of present truth, to bind about in the place of adding building to building, and let the money come here that we may make a beginning. Help us, that we may have facilities to work with. The halls with their ruinous prices are beyond our reach. Elder Starr sent \n                                                                           1153\nto Dunedin to know what would be the price of a hall in that city for one night. The message was returned, \"Ten pounds. Nothing less.\" If we cannot have help to erect houses of worship the work will not, cannot, advance. In America there are so many churches to help lift the work in its various branches. Here there are only a few churches, and most of the members are poor and unable to pay more than a meager tithe. I feel sad at the sight of this picture.",
