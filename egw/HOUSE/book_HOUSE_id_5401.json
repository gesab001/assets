No matter what may have been our sins and shortcomings, there is a fountain open in the house of David for all sin and uncleanness. \u201cCome now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\u201d This is the word of the Lord. Shall we accept it? Shall we believe on Him?\u2014Signs of the Times, Apr. 2, 1894.",
