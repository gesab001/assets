    "word": "July 20, 1885--I could not sleep much during the night for my pain was great in my hip. I was thankful for the light of day. We arrived at Chicago. Took cars at one for Battle Creek, Michigan. Arrived at Battle Creek about half past eight p.m. Met Brother Sawyer, who urged us to go to sanitarium. Edson was waiting for us and we took lunch at his house. W. C. White did not come with us on this last stage of the journey. He had business to transact in Chicago. The weather was excessively hot, not favorable for sleeping.--Ms. 16a, 1885, pp. 2-3. (Diary, July 13-20, 1885.)",
