    "word": "Tomorrow morning we shall reach Edgefield Junction, which is only twelve miles from Nashville. We shall stay there for the rest of the day; for we wish to visit a farm which is for sale at Madison, about nine miles from Nashville, and two and a half miles from the railway. It is said that this farm contains nearly one hundred acres of good bottom land, more than one hundred acres of second quality agricultural land suitable for grain and fruit, and about two hundred acres of pasture land. We think that it can be purchased for about twelve thousand dollars. It is said that there is on it over two thousand dollars' worth of stock and farm implements. I desire to look at this farm, and if it be the will of the Lord, I shall do so tomorrow afternoon. The farm has a roomy house, barns, and other buildings, and two and a half miles of good stone \n                                                                           6\nfence. Considering its advantages, its price is less than anything else we have seen in this part of Tennessee.",
