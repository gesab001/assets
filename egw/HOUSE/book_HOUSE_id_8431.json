    "word": "But oh, how fast the world is rushing on in their madness, hastening the day of retribution. \"As the days of Noah were, so also shall the days of the coming of the Son of Man be.\" Each day man is forming his own destiny. Every day his account is passed by the heavenly Watcher into the record books of heaven. The time will come when each one must meet the history of his life. But how much of the money which God has given to man, the money which should be used to restore the obliterated image of Jesus, is used to gratify appetite and ambition, to prepare extravagant festivals, and to build and furnish grand houses.",
