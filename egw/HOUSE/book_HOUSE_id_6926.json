    "word": "Gather up the precious rays of light, and yet grasp for more. If any man thirst, let him come and drink, and drink again, and continue drinking. If any thirst, come and drink. Why stand back from the fountain? Why not come to the fullness of Christ? He has put into our hands the key which will open the storehouse where are the immortal treasures. Shall we not take of His love and drink in of His fullness? God grant that we shall have an experimental knowledge of what it is to be Christ's, and Christ ours. Let self die and break all to pieces, and let Jesus put His armor upon us, and put His mold and superscription upon us.",
