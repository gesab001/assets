    "word": "To Reach the Masses. \n\n     In the sermon on the mount, Christ said to His disciples, \"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Matthew 5:14-16. If our camp-meetings' are conducted as they should be, they will indeed be a light in the world. They should be held in the large cities and towns where the message of truth has not been proclaimed, and they should continue for two or three weeks. It may sometimes be advisable to hold a camp-meeting for several successive seasons in the same place; but, as a rule, the place of meeting should be changed from year to year. Instead of having mammoth camp-meetings in a few localities, more good would be done by \n\n\n                     - 4 - \n\nhaving smaller meetings in many places. Thus the work will be constantly extending into new fields. Just as soon as the standard of truth is lifted in one locality; and it is safe to leave the converts to the faith, we must plan to enter other new fields. Our camp-meetings are a power, and when held in a place where the community can be stirred, they will have far greater power than when, for the convenience of our own people, they are located where, because of previous meetings and the rejection of truth, the public interest is deadened.",
