    "word": "You are not always as particular about your words as you should be; you make rash statements. The above declarations are not true. I learn that, to excuse your practice of using wine, you have stated, so I have been informed, that Brother and Sister White kept wine in their house, and to your certain knowledge used it. This, like the statement in regard to drinking tea, is not true. Will you please tell me why you make such rash statements? You claim to be my friend; do you imagine these statements will help my influence among the people? I do not use tea, either green or black. Not a spoonful has passed my lips for many years, except when crossing the ocean, and once since on this side I took it as a medicine when I was sick and vomiting. In such circumstances it may prove a present relief.",
