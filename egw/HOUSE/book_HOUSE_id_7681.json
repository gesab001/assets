    "word": "Elder Ings and wife, and Elder Ertzenberger and I attended the dedication of a small house in Tramelan. Soon after I came into Brother Roth's house, I was alarmed for myself. The water closets were in the house, and on each floor was a water closet. The house was permeated with the poison, and thus it proved to work on me. I was taken with great pain in my stomach, as if poisoned. Still I spoke Sabbath. We had a very solemn meeting. I had to give the dedicatory discourse which was interpreted by Brother Ertzenberger.",
