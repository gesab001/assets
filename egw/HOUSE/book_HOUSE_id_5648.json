    "word": "And I saw, that as Christ is the vine, and his children the branches: so Satan is the \"root\", and his children are the \"branches;\" and at the final destruction of \"Gog and Magog,\" the whole wicked host will be burnt up, \"root and branch,\" and cease to exist. Then will appear the new heaven and the new earth. Then will the saints \"build houses,\" and \"plant vineyards.\" I saw, that all the righteous dead were raised by the voice of the Son of God, at the first resurrection; and all that were raised at the second resurrection, were burnt up, and ceased to exist.",
