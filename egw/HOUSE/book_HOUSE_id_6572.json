    "word": "We want the Spirit of God to come in to meet with us in our worship. When we enter the house, it would be pleasing to God if all would lift up their hearts to God in secret prayer. On entering the desk every minister \n\n\n                                        -236- \n\nshould drop on his knees to implore divine help. We do not take hold as we ought of the divine arm. We might be stronger spiritually. Every defect of character must be removed in order that we may stand before the great white throne. There the books will be opened and from them we are to be judged, and we do not want to be ashamed to meet our record. If we manifest great zeal in worldly business and are dead in spiritual things it will be manifest in the house of God. The meetings can be made more interesting if all would have more earnestness in spiritual life. God is full of blessings, but if we do not prize them we suffer loss. We need to take hold of the arm of God and God will meet you in this house.",
