    "word": "On coming to the temple at the opening of His ministry, Christ repaired to the temple, and found His Father's house desecrated by worldly traffic. He drove out from the temple courts the buyers and the sellers, and the priests and rulers. He \"poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables, and said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.\" The money taken by the dealers for the sacrificial offerings was robbery of the people; and they had made the house of God a den of thieves, and with a stern rebuke Christ exposed their extortionate traffic.",
