    "word": "On the twenty-sixth of this month I shall be eighty-three years old. A week ago I spoke in the Sanitarium chapel. The chapel has been enlarged, and will seat many more than it formerly did. I spoke for an hour. The house was full of interested listeners, and I was much blessed in speaking. A week before, I spoke at the Pacific Union College. This is the school property that was recently purchased by our people. We are well satisfied with this property. The Lord gave me his Holy Spirit, and I had freedom in speaking to those assembled.",
