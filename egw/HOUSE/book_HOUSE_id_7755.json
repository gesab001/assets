    "word": "Brooklyn, New York, Sabbath, November 15, 1890 \n\n     We arrived here in this city Friday morning. [HERE ELLEN WHITE STATES THAT THEY ARRIVED IN NEW YORK CITY ON FRIDAY MORNING. BUT IN THE PREVIOUS ENTRY QUOTED (LETTER 72A, 1890) SHE SAYS--PROBABLY MORE CORRECTLY--THAT IT WAS THURSDAY.] I was pleased to ride all the way from the ferry in the  streetcar and not on the elevated railroad. We had a good room assigned to my use exclusively, but the elevated railroad goes directly by the house and I was fearful the thundering noise would prevent me from sleeping. There is a large company who are being accommodated in three different tenements.--Ms. 46, 1890, p. 3 (Diary 16, p. 314).",
