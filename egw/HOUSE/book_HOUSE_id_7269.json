    "word": "You are not to wait for perfect assurance before you become the Lord's light bearer to the world. You have naturally a despondent temperament to deal with, and the Lord calls upon you to take your light from under the bushel, and let it give light to all that are in the house. You have precious victories to gain. Do not spoil your religious experience by dwelling upon the dark side, and talking impossibility. Light is to shine in precious, encouraging words to all that are in the house.",
