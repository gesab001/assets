In giving us this book, the Lord gave us a great blessing. I praise Him with heart and soul that He put it into my heart to give this book for the relief of the schools. I praise Him that our publishing houses [THE PUBLISHING HOUSES PRODUCED THE RELIEF BOOKS AT COST AND PASSED THEM ON WITHOUT PROFIT TO THE CHURCHES TO BE SOLD.] acted so generous a part in the work of preparing the book for sale. And I praise Him that our people have put their hand so nobly to the work of its circulation. The Lord has greatly blessed them. In the effort to sell this book, they have learned by practical experience what they can do for the advancement of the work. And they have learned also how to speak to strangers about the truth. Through the lessons contained in this book, sinners have been warned, convicted, and converted.--Lt 43, 1903.",
