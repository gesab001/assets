    "word": "I have not the least care of anything in the house. Mary White is a good general. Shew is first rate. Shew gets meals now very good with some oversight. We have not had a particle of meat in the house since you left and long before you left. We have had salmon a few times. It has been rather high. We had green peas today. There are aplenty of strawberries in market. We have had none yet, too high--25 or 30 cents a box. We had new beets and new potatoes. You need not be concerned in regard to Willie's and Mary's economy. They are just right in these matters. I think they do splendidly. Everything seems to move off smoothly and well. All the house is well taken care of.",
