    "word": "No child is to be allowed to rule in the house, but parents are to teach their children to do justice and judgment, and to keep the way of the Lord. But your children know not how to reverence or even respect the truth, and they never will unless they turn from fictitious reading,--the idol to which they have given soul and body. They keep their minds intoxicated with this reading, it is the god they worship, and while they continue this practice they are virtually intoxicated in mind as any drunkard.--Letter 32, 1896, pp. 4, 5. (To Brother and Sister Hughes, March 7, 1896.)",
