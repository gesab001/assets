    "word": "I have spoken [in Kaeo, New Zealand] the two Sabbaths and Sundays, and four times in the evening. On the first Sabbath we held the meeting in the little chapel built for Seventh-day Adventists. Sunday afternoon we secured the Wesleyan chapel, and I spoke to the people. The house was crowded to its utmost extent, and benches and everything available was pressed into service. The little bench before the pulpit, and the platform, were filled with children. The Lord gave me freedom in speaking, and there was the very best of attention. . . .",
