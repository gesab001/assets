    "word": "Adelaide is a beautiful city. In many respects it resembles Copenhagen, though on a smaller and less elaborate scale. Most of the houses are detached. The streets are broad and macadamized with stone. These stones are almost white, and this is very trying to the eyes in the sunshine. Many of the houses are built with a view to keeping out the heat and sunshine as far as possible. These have a second brick wall, built about six or eight feet from the house wall, with archways in front of the doors and windows. Some of these buildings are two and three stories high. The houses are built of brick and stone. In many of them fine taste and art is displayed in the arrangement of the different colors of brick, making them very rich in appearance. \n\n\n                                 -343-",
