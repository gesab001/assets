    "word": "May, my dear child, I do not wish you to overwork, but I want you to be prompt, and bear your share of responsibility. Those who do work only when compelled to do so will be worthless. You can do work with cheerfulness and not wait to be told. Be faithful in little things, and then it will be easy for you to be faithful in larger things. Remember that there are duties for you to perform just as important to perfect your experience as the duties \n\n\n                                    -96- \n\nthose older have to do to perfect their experience. Do your work, not as though it was a burden, but a pleasure, as though done for Jesus. Your Saviour was an obedient child, working with His father at the simple trade of a carpenter. You must eat and drink in order to live, and then, as a natural result, the dishes must be washed, floors swept, if you live in houses. Now act your part with fidelity, doing your work for Jesus.--Letter 3, 1881, pp. 2, 3. (To \"Dear Children, Addie and May Walling,\" April 15, 1881.)",
