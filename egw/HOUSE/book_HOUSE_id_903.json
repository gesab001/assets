    "word": "Value of Outdoor Life \n\n     The advantage of outdoor life must never be lost sight of. How thankful we should be that God has given us beautiful sanitarium properties at Paradise Valley and Glendale and Loma Linda! \"Out of the cities! out of the cities!\"--this has been my message for years.

And yet how slow some are to realize that the crowded cities are not favorable places for sanitarium work!",
