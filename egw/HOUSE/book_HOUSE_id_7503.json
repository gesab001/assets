    "word": "All day Wednesday we had been very busy. We visited the elder of the church at Hobart. At his home we spread our lunch on the table, and enjoyed our simple fare of bread and fruit. We had a precious season of prayer with the family, and I know that the blessing of the Lord rested upon us. We then visited at Brother Shannon's house. He was not at home, but we had a little visit with his wife. The Malcolm family had moved to Hobart, and we called upon them. They were very glad to see us, and we had a profitable visit with them, engaging in a season of prayer that was much appreciated.",
