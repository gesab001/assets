    "word": "The old, experienced teachers, who have been in the work from the beginning, are especially fitted to carry the work forward from point to point. But they can not do this alone. They must have helpers. The Lord would have His workers unite their efforts, as the workmen do in the building of a house. Elder J has his line of work, but there are other parts that he must leave to others.",
