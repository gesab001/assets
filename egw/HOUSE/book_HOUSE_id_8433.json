    "word": "The Lord's workers need the melting love of Jesus in their hearts. Let every minister live a man among men. Let him in well-regulated methods go from house to house, bearing ever the censer of heaven's fragrant atmosphere of love. Anticipate the sorrows, the difficulties, the troubles of others. Enter into the joys and cares of both high and low, rich and poor.",
