    "word": "We have had great trials in securing a lot on which to build a church. We decided on one, but were not able to pay the large sum asked-- 600 pounds for a 100-foot lot--and therefore had to give it up. We have found another lot, and are going to take it if it can be secured for 500 pounds. It is 200 feet by 90 feet. The owner, a woman, lives at quite a distance from Stanmore, but we hope to receive an answer in a few days. The building itself will cost 700 pounds, but a meetinghouse must be built. When wind and rain come, the tent is not a proper place for meeting. \n\n\n                                    -359-",
