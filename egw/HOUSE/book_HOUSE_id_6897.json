    "word": "The light given me from the Lord is that whatever land we occupy is to have the very best kind of care and to serve as an object lesson to the Colonials of what the land will do, if properly worked. So you see, this has been a special, very important period of time for us. All our implements have to be bought in Sydney. All our provisions come from Sydney, and all our corrugated iron for [the] roofing of buildings, houses, and stables comes from Sydney. The rough lumber comes from the mills near us--from Morisset and Dora Creek--the other material from Sydney.",
