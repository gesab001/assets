    "word": "Two miles west of Sherman we cross Dale Creek bridge, one of the most wonderful sights on the route. It looks frail and incapable of sustaining the weight of so ponderous a train, but it is built of iron and is really very substantial. It is 650 feet long, 130 feet high. A beautiful, silvery stream is winding its way in the depths below. And as we look down upon the dwellings they seem like mere pigeon houses in the distance.",
