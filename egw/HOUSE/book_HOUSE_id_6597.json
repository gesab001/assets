    "word": "Grythyttehed, Sweden, October 23, 1885. We reached this place about four o'clock. At the depot we met Brother Hedin and wife, who led the way to their house. We were welcomed heartily by these dear friends. We regretted we could not speak to them in their own tongue. We were accommodated with two good rooms, well warmed, and good beds. The sky is cloudless. Stars and moon are shining in the heavens. I was unable to sleep for some hours after retiring.",
