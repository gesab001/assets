    "word": "There is much more that I might say, but I will withhold it. God pity those who are deceived by men. I am instructed to say, Lift up your voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins. Now is the time to raise the standard aloft. I am to give the message that all advantage gained by compliance with tainted customs, will leave its slimy trail. Any man, whatever his profession may be, who has committed himself to an objectionable course of action, opposed to that which is pure, lovely, and of good report, will trample upon the word of God. Would that those who have had great light would, in this the day of atonement, humble their souls and confess and forsake their sins, declaring that from henceforth by the grace of God, they will hold fast to their integrity, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan, and taking the word of God as their rule of conduct, their standard of duty.",
