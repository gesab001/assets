The meetings in Washington were excellent, and every meeting seemed to increase in interest. Every succeeding meeting was pronounced the best. I spoke eight times in Washington with perfect freedom. I commenced to speak on the Sabbath, and ended the Sabbath following. We had a most blessed, powerful meeting on the last Sabbath. As in Danvers, nearly all in the house presented themselves for prayers. The presence of the Lord was in the meetings held, and the church was greatly strengthened and increased in faith and courage.",
