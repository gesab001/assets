    "word": "Kindergarten Methods to be Used in Camp Meetings: \n     Important features of the camp meeting are the meetings for the children and youth. Special meetings should be arranged for the children. Kindergarten methods and object-lessons from nature can be used to great advantage in interesting the little ones. By this means they can be taught the parables of Christ. Thus truth will be fastened in their minds as a nail in a sure place. This is a work of the greatest consequence to the younger members of the Lord's family. Even children who are favored with Christian instruction at home can learn much in these meetings that will be a great help to them. Teach the children with the simplicity of Christ. They will receive the knowledge, and as they return to their homes, they will bring forth from the treasure house of the heart precious lessons.",
