    "word": "I am very sorry that you have taken a leading, active part in establishing the health institution in Ohio, for I cannot think that the Lord is moving you in this matter. If Sabbathkeepers are raised up in Cleveland, which I know is an important field, you will see the need of building a house of worship there in order to facilitate the work, but where is the means to do this? Who will now come to the front, and invest where means is really essential? My brother, you have taken upon yourself burdens that the Lord has not required you to take. The Mount Vernon Sanitarium was a private enterprise, and I cannot see why you should now call means from the churches in Ohio to sustain it. Nor can I see the justice of attempting to shift the burden of this institution on the General Conference, which has so many and such heavy burdens in providing for the foreign missions and for other branches of the work.",
