    "word": "Publishing Houses in Missionary Lands.--At various points in missionary lands publishing houses must be established. To give character to the work, to be centers of effort and influence, to attract the attention of the people, to develop the talents and capabilities of the believers, to unify the new churches, and to second the efforts of the workers, giving them facilities for more ready communication with the churches and more rapid dissemination of the message--all these and many other considerations plead for the establishment of publishing centers in missionary fields.--7T 145.",
