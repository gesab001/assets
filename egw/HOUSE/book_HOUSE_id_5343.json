    "word": "I was in perfect agony. It seemed that my brain and every part of my body was suffering. At times I would rise up, and think, \"I will not lie here another moment.\" Then I would think, \"You will only arouse those who are in the house, and they cannot do anything for you.\" And so I kept looking to the Lord, and saying, \"Lord, You know all about this pain.\" The suffering continued, at times in the jaw, then in the brain, and then in other members of the body, until nearly daylight. Just before the break of day I fell asleep for about an hour.",
