    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     I have described what canvassers ought to be; and may the Lord open your minds to comprehend this subject in its length and breadth, and \n28\nmay you realize your duty to represent the character of Christ by your patient courage and steadfast integrity. Remember that you can deny Him by a lax, undecided character. Young men, if you will take with you into the canvassing field principles of righteousness, you will be respected, and many will believe the truth you advocate, because your daily life will be a bright light which gives light to all that are in the house. Even your enemies, though they may war against your doctrines, will respect you; and your simple words will have a power that will carry conviction of hearts.",
