    "word": "Our work is much more important than is supposed, and requires much more thought. The translators should have less hours to devote to close and absorbing intellectual labor, lest the brain become too weary, and the force of penetration being relaxed, the labor accomplished shall be imperfect. In dealing with the truth, everything should be done with a grace and a solidity which have not thus far characterized the work; for this reason, the mind of one should not be overburdened. Brother _____ has too much to do. He is in danger of contracting the habit of not giving to his work all the thought, all the effort and all the care that he should, and as considerable responsibility rests upon him, he must not be laden with a multiplicity of matters which he feels he must do, lest he shall become positively incapable for the competent and thorough work which is needed.--Ms 24, 1887, pp. 3-6. (\"Testimony for the Workers of the Publishing House at Basel,\" February 14, 1887.)",
