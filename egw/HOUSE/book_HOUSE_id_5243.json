    "word": "Self-denial for the Work\n     Every soul is precious in God's sight, and I am wondering what can be done for the destitute fields where the flock of God is without a shepherd. I have thought that if every Seventh-day Adventist family would, during the year 1900, cut off every needless indulgence, and place the money thus saved in the Lord's treasury, there would be \u201cmeat in his house.\u201d A rich blessing would rest upon those thus practising self-denial. The Lord would give them more to give. We need so much just now these fruits of self-denial, to support women missionaries in the field. O, how my soul has thirsted for the pennies and shillings and pounds which have slipped through the fingers of those who do not realize how much they have spent for self and pride. Christ is hungering and thirsting for the money that men and women and children are thoughtlessly spending for self-gratification. If they denied their inclinations, this money might be used to do a most precious work for Christ. He says to all, old and young, \u201cWe are labourers together with God; ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\u201d",
