    "word": "The Review and Herald and the Signs of the Times are cheap papers, at the full price. The Review is a valuable paper; it contains matters of great interest to the church, and should be placed in every family of believers. If any are too poor to take it, the church should, by subscription, raise the amount of the full price of the paper, and supply the destitute families. How much better would be this plan than throwing the poor upon the mercies of the publishing house or the tract and missionary society.",
