    "word": "In the word of God I find these promises, \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord of Hosts, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah. Not according to that which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord. But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be My people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them even unto the greatest, saith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.\" \n                                                                           294\nI thank the Lord for these words of comfort and encouragement. I will put my trust in the Lord, and will wait patiently for Him. He will work in our behalf, and make us to rejoice in His mercies. He will surely be the help of His people.",
