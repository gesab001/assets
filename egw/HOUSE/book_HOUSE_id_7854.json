    "word": "These words of Jesus were spoken just before He ascended to heaven. Immediately after His ascension the disciples returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, and with a few others had a most wonderful meeting, as recorded in the verses following. A cloud of holy angels had escorted Jesus into the heavens, and the disciples returned with joy. Why were they so joyful? Not because Jesus had left them, but because of the promise to come again. Just a short time before He had told them that in His Father's house were many mansions, and that He would go to prepare a place for them, and if He went, He would come again and receive them unto Himself, that where He was, there they might be also. This promise, renewed by the angels, gave great joy to the disciples.",
