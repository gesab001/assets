    "word": "As Jesus hung upon the cross during those long hours of agony, He did not forget His mother. She had returned to the terrible scene, for she could not longer remain away from her Son. The last lesson of Jesus was one of compassion and humanity. He looked upon the grief-stricken face of His mother, and then upon His beloved disciple John. He said to His mother, \"Woman, behold thy son!\" Then He said to John, \"Behold thy mother!\" And from that hour John took her to his own house.",
