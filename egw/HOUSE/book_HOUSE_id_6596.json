    "word": "MR No. 205 - E. G. White Diary and Letter Material\n\n     Kopparberg, Sweden, October 22, 1885. It is a beautiful day. Clear and cold. We learned we could not leave this place until twelve o'clock p.m. Thursday. We called for breakfast. The custom in Sweden in houses and good-sized hotels is to keep a table whereon is placed bread, butter, cold meat, canned fish, and several other articles of food. It is the custom for all who are entertained to go to this table and help themselves, always cutting the bread and butter first at this large table. There are several smaller tables. If you call for food and specify the articles you want they are brought to you, and when anything on the large table is desired the guests arise, walk to the table and help themselves, and take it to the small table, but at the large general table you remain standing to cut bread and butter. It looked so odd to see men, one after another, come in, go to the long table, eat their bread and butter--walking about talking and eating--then sit at the small tables for a special dish; but eat and walk and talk from the long table until the dish they called for is brought in, and they take it to the small table and eat it, but always first eat the \"butter goose\"--which is bread and butter--at the large table. There is no stinginess manifested. There is a most liberal supply placed before you and you can eat plentifully of any and every dish for 40 cents each.",
