    "word": "The first building erected on the premises was a washroom, laundry, and woodshed all combined, to give the carpenters a shelter to work. We counseled together that this should be converted into a dwellinghouse for Willie and his family. Their sleepingroom is 12 by 12. This woodshed was floored, the rafters whitewashed, a pantry was partitioned off, and they had a kitchen 12 by 12. Shelves were put in this pantry, and just room left for a stove. A platform eight feet wide was made and iron roof put above it and that leaves a roomy piazza with bags ripped up [and] nailed on as siding. From this platform is a raised walk even with the entrance to my family tent, which is 15 by 29. There is a curtain made to partition off a room in one end for the children, and the remaining room is for parlor and dining room. They make out. They are fixed quite cozy. \n\n\n                                     -171-",
