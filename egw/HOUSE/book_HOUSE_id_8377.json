    "word": "In regard to the College I would say, Raise the price of tuition and have a better class of students. But \n                                                                           366\nprovision should be made to do the very best for those who come, to secure for them every healthful, intellectual, and moral advantage. I see the need of still another boarding house, and there may be need of another building for the students. I cannot see how you can do better than you have in calling for means while this debt is against the College. It ought not to be there, and if there had been the right kind of planning it would not exist; that is, if those especially employed in the College were all enterprising men of broader ideas. They would constantly be exercising ingenuity and tact, and devising means whereby the College should not become burdened with debt.",
