    "word": "\u201cWhile we were absent from Rochester on this eastern tour the foreman of the Office was attacked with cholera. He was an unconverted young man. The lady of the house where he boarded died with the same disease, also her daughter. He was then brought down and no one ventured to take care of him, fearing the disease. The Office hands watched over him until the disease seemed checked, then took him to our house. He had a relapse and a physician attended him and exerted himself to the utmost to save him, but at length told him that his \n296\ncase was hopeless, that he could not survive through the night. Those interested for him could not bear to see the young man die without hope. They prayed around his bedside while he was suffering great agony. He also prayed that the Lord would have mercy upon him, and forgive his sins. Yet he obtained no relief. He continued to cramp and toss in restless agony. The brethren continued in prayer all night that he might be spared to repent of his sins and keep the commandments of God. He at length seemed to consecrate himself to God, and promised the Lord he would keep the Sabbath and serve him. He soon felt relief. The next morning the physician came, and as he entered, said, \u2018I told my wife about one o'clock this morning that in all probability the young man was out of his trouble.\u2019 He was told that he was alive. The physician was surprised and immediately ascended the stairs to his room, and as he examined his pulse, said, \u2018Young man, you are better, the crisis is past, but it is not my skill that saved you, but a higher power. With good nursing you may get about again.\u2019 He gained rapidly, and soon took his place in the Office, a converted man.",
