    "word": "Twenty years ago, I was surprised at the cautions and warnings given me in reference to the publishing house on the Pacific Coast,--that it was ever to remain independent of all other Institutions; that it was to be controlled by no other institution, but was to do the Lord's work under his guidance and protection. The Lord says, \"All ye are brethren,\" and the Pacific Press is not to be envied and looked upon with jealousy and suspicion by the stronger publishing house at Battle Creek. It must maintain its own individuality, and be strictly guarded from any corruption. It must not be merged into any other institution. The hand of power and control at Battle Creek must not reach across the continent to manage it.",
