    "word": "My health is recovering. I have been strengthened by the Lord to speak to the people five times. I was able to speak the first Sabbath after reaching Melbourne, and I felt more natural than I have at any time since I was first afflicted. The Lord blessed me as I spoke from the first four verses of John 14. I spoke again on Sunday on the same subject. On this day there was a fair congregation, and I had much freedom in speaking. One man who is studying for the ministry was present, and he said he enjoyed the meeting much. \"Why,\" said he, \"how could I help but enjoy such preaching as that?\" Another man, a great critic, living in the same house with one of our sisters, said that he was going to the meeting to take notes, and would pick Mrs. White all to pieces. After the meeting this sister told me that he sat through the meeting with his eyes fastened upon me, and did not use his pencil once.",
