    "word": "Faithfulness in the Parental Home. It is by faithfulness to duty in the parental home that the young are to prepare themselves for homes of their own. Let them here practice self-denial and manifest kindness, courtesy, and Christian sympathy. Thus love will be kept warm in the heart, and he who goes out from such a household to stand at the head of a family of his own will know how to promote the happiness of her whom he has chosen as a companion for life. \n                                                                           25\nMarriage, instead of being the end of love, will be only its beginning.--PP 176.",
