    "word": "M. H.--149 \n     Every church should be a training school for Christian workers. Its members should be taught how to give Bible readings, how to conduct and teach Sabbath-school classes, how best to help the poor and to care for the sick, how to work for the unconverted. There should be schools of health, \n\n20 \n\ncooking schools, and classes in various lines of Christian help work. There should not only be teaching, but actual work under experienced instructors.  {TSDF 19.10}  \n                                                       M. H.--194 \n     In ministry to the poor there is a wide field of service for women as well as for men. The efficient cook, the housekeeper, the seamstress, the nurse--the help of all is needed. Let the members of poor households be taught how to cook, how to make and mend their own clothing, how to nurse the sick, how to care properly for the home.",
