    "word": "The president of the General Conference [SEE APPENDIX.] should have the privilege of deciding who shall stand by his side as counselors. Those who will keep the way of the Lord, who will preserve clear, sharp discernment by cultivating home religion, are safe counselors. Of such a one. \n                                                                           343\nthe Searcher of hearts saith, \"I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\" Counselors of the character that God chose for Moses are needed by the president of the General Conference. It was his privilege at least to express his preference as to the men who should be his counselors. It was his privilege to discern between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not. But a strange blindness was upon him. There has been a leavening influence upon human minds, and it has been most painful. For years God has been dishonored. . . .",
