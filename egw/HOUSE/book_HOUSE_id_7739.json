White \n                  from October 8 to December 30, 1890 \n\n            Syracuse, New York, Thursday, October 9, 1890 \n\n     At Niagara bridge we stepped out of the sleeper and took our seats in the day coach. Soon every available seat was occupied. We reached Syracuse about noon. Here Sister Burdick found us and invited us to go to her house for refreshments. It was raining. Her husband had a covered carriage but could take only one in it. We thought best to step into the day coach, although it would not be in motion for one hour and a half. We had a visit with Brother Burdick in the cars. He seemed to be very anxious that we should visit Syracuse and labor for the church. Syracuse is a large city and the workers in it are very few.--Ms. 41, 1890, p. 1 (Diary 16, p. 169).",
