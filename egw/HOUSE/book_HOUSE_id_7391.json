    "word": "My brother, when will you learn this lesson! It is not houses, lands, carriages, expensive furniture, outward display, which make a man stand high in the sight of a holy God and the ministering angels. God looks at the heart. He reads every purpose of the mind. He knows the motives which prompt to action. \n\n\n                                    -94- \n\nHe reads between every line of writing sent out. He can distinguish between the true and the false. He places His seal upon the deeds that are done and the books that are written in humility and contrition of heart. He values sincerity and purity of principle above everything else.--Letter 3, 1901. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May 7, 1987. Entire Letter.",
