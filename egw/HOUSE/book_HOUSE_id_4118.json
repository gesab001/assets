    "word": "I saw that angels were filled with amazement as they beheld the sufferings and death of the King of glory. But I saw that it was no marvel to the angelic host that the Lord of life and glory, who filled all heaven with joy and splendor, should break the bands of death, and walk forth from his prison house a triumphant conqueror.

But, I saw that neither of those events were designed to alter or abolish God's law; but they give the strongest proof of its immutability.",
