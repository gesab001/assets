    "word": "Rest after preaching, then visit.--Ministers have all that they ought to do to preach the Word, and after they have urged solemn truth upon the people they should maintain a humble dignity as the preachers of exalted truth and as representatives of the truth presented to the people. After their labored effort they need rest. . . . If there are those who still have a reserve force and can be taxed without injury to themselves, there is important\n226\nwork for them to do, and it has but just commenced when they have spoken the truth to the people. Then come the exemplary preaching, the watchful care, the seeking to do good to others, the conversation, and visiting at the fireside from house to house, entering into the condition of mind and the spiritual state of those who listened to the discourse from their lips; exhorting this one, reproving that one, rebuking another, and comforting the afflicted, suffering, and desponding. The mind should be as free from weariness as possible that they may be minutemen, \"instant in season, out of season.\" They should obey the injunction given by Paul to Timothy: \"Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them.\"--1T 472.",
