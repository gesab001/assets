    "word": "Iniquity abounds on every hand, and if the children are saved, earnest, persevering effort must be put forth. Christ has said, \"I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified.\" He wanted His disciples to be sanctified, and He made Himself their example, that they might follow Him. What if fathers and mothers should take this same position, saying, \"I want my children to have steadfast principles, and I will give them an example of this in my life\"? Let the mother think no sacrifice too great, if made for the salvation of her household. Remember, Jesus gave His life for the purpose of rescuing you and yours from ruin. You will have His sympathy and help in this blessed work, and will be a laborer together with God.",
