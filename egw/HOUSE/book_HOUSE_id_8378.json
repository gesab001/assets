    "word": "I have been shown that brain workers have a God-given capital. The improvement of their brain belongs to God, and not man. If the worker gives the time to his employer for which he receives his pay, the employer has no further claim upon him. But if by close and diligent economy of moments he prepares matter for publication, it is his to do with as he, in the fear of God, thinks he can serve the cause of God the best. If he gives up all except a small royalty, he should not be urged to do more: he has already done a good work for those who handle the books; but if the publishers want it all, and cannot see that they are exceeding their rights in the demand, it would be the worst thing that could be done for the author to accede to their grasping, avaricious spirit, even though the plea be that it is for God's cause. The authors are responsible for the manner in which they use means received. There will be many calls for it. It was shown me that there would be many interests to build up, and that my husband and myself would be called upon to invest in meeting houses that would have to be erected which would never be built unless some one should feel and know the needs of the cause, and lead out in investments themselves.",
