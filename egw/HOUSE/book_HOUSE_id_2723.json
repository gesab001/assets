    "word": "Search the Word to find truths both new and old for the benefit of others.--The minister of the gospel of Christ is to watch for souls as he that must give an account. He is to be often on his knees in prayer, asking for heavenly wisdom, that he may strengthen \"the things which remain, that are ready to die.\" By living in accordance with the will of God, he is to place himself under divine power. The Word of God is to be his guide. In this Word there are promises, directions, warnings, and reproofs, which he is to use in his work as the occasion may require. With a humble heart and a willing mind he is to search this Word, that for the benefit of others he may draw from the storehouse of truth things new and old. He is ever to seek to lead minds to gain a personal knowledge of the truth. Many are sorely tempted and ready to die because they have not a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.--RH Jan. 21, 1902.",
