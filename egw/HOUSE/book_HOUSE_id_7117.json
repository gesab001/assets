    "word": "On our way home we stopped for a few hours at the home of Brother Workman. We found everything about the house very neat and clean. Brother Workman has been in ill health for some time. For a while he took treatment at the St. Helena Sanitarium, but is now at home with his family. His wife is a very pleasant woman. There is one daughter about 29 years old working as a nurse at the sanitarium; another daughter of about 18 helps the mother in the home. There is a son about 15 years old and a little girl of 11. Mabel, Willie White's second daughter, is married to the eldest son of the family, and another is bookkeeper at Healdsburg College.",
