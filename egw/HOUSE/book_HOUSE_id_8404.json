    "word": "The Lord says, I will take illiterate men, obscure men, and move upon them by My Spirit to carry out My purposes in the work of saving souls. The last message of mercy will be given by a people who love and fear Me. \u201cNot by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit.\u201d We should give willing, devoted men every possible encouragement to go forward and in their humble way reveal their loyalty to principle and their integrity to God. Let them visit the people at their homes, and talk and pray with the unwarned regarding the soon-coming Saviour. Let them take a personal interest in those whom they meet. Christ took a personal interest in men and women while He lived on this earth. He was a true missionary everywhere He went. His followers are to go about doing good, even as He did. By personal efforts to meet the people where they are, coarse and rough though some of these people may be, humble house-tohouse missionaries and colporteurs may win the hearts of many to Christ. In their unpretentious way they can reach a class that ministers generally cannot touch.",
