    "word": "How many are losing rich blessings and becoming spiritually dwarfed because they withhold from God His own. The enemy of God and man is constantly at work to divert the treasures which belong to God and to please and honor and glorify the human agent.

They fail to limit their desires, when by so doing they would bring blessing to themselves and to their families.",
