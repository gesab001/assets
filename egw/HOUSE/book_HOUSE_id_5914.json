White. \n\n     \"Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high. . . . Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken.\" \"Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work; that saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. Shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar? . . . . Thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.\" Habakkuk 2:9-15; Jeremiah 22:13-17.",
