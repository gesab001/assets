    "word": "Increasing numbers in your college is no evidence that your labors are being crowned with success. The Lord scorns all exhibition of pride and display. It is the strength of moral power increasing and pervading the college that testifies of its prosperity. It is the character, the virtue, and intelligence of the people composing our churches and colleges, not their numbers, that is a source of joy and should awaken thankfulness in the heart of every Christian. The Spirit of Christ in righteousness prevailing and pervading our church and college, publishing house and sanitarium, should be the cause of rejoicing, rather than their numbers.",
