    "word": "Walling's Mills Monday, September 8, 1873. We prepared an early breakfast for Mr. Walling. My husband talked with Mr. Walling in reference to the house, which seemed to be leaning forward. I rinsed out a portion of the washing, hung them out to dry. We then went to Black Hawk. While trading we were much surprised to see Brother Glover walk into the store. We met very unexpectedly. We were very happy to meet Brother Glover. He rode up to Central with us. We purchased some things and returned home with Brother Glover an extra passenger. He had come to Colorado on business. His son Eli was sketching Denver and was going to Boulder City to sketch from that place and Brother Glover to canvass for him and take orders. Brother Glover spoke with great tenderness of his wife who has recently died. He feels her loss deeply. May God comfort him in his affliction.",
