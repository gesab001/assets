    "word": "God calls for men and women to be laborers together with him, to be workers who are sound in faith, pure in heart, and single in purpose. They should work to glorify God by saving souls that are lost. God requires heart-service. A service of form, lip-service, is wholly ineffectual in the work of converting souls to God. A service that comes not from the heart is as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. The heart must be stirred with the co-operative energy of the Holy Spirit, then standing in full view of the cross of Calvary by faith, the laborer can communicate to others the divine inspiration of his theme. From a full treasure-house he can bring forth things new and old, which will stir the hearts of his hearers, and, convicted, they will cry out, \"What must I do to be saved?\" If the minister leaves the pulpit, and separates himself from the people without making a special, personal effort for those whose hearts have been touched by the love of Christ, he has lost an opportunity which he will never recover.",
