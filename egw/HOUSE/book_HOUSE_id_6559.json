    "word": "Diary, Tramelan, Switzerland, May 22, 1886 \n     We have had a very interesting morning's ride, fifteen miles from Moutier to this place. We arrived here about noon. Were heartily welcomed by Brother Roth (pronounced Rote). They have a large, interesting family. Seven boys and three girls are living. One died in the faith a few years since. They are engaged in business and live in a large house. They have a merchant tailor establishment, another department for groceries, another for hats, another for shoes and sundries, and a large bakery establishment. They have a good business and are in very superior circumstances for Switzerland. \n\n\n                                  -229- \n\nTheir children are all with them in the truth. They have two sharp, intelligent boys--one nine years old, the other eleven or twelve.",
