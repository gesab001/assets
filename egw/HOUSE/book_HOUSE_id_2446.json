    "word": "Christ Came Right to the Point.--In Christ's teaching there is no long, farfetched, complicated reasoning. He comes right to the point. In His ministry He read every heart as an open book, and from the inexhaustible store of His treasure-house He drew things both new and old to illustrate and enforce His teachings. He touched the heart and awakened the sympathies.--MS 24, 1891. (Ev 171.)",
