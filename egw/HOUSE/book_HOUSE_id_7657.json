    "word": "We cannot, even one of us, glorify God, only through the acceptance of the grace given us. We cannot keep His commandments, only as we improve the grace and truth given us for this purpose. Brother Haskell, we must come up upon higher, holier ground. We must lead the people step by step. We must teach the people to improve the talents God has given them. We do not sufficiently impress upon the ministers the importance of ministering as well as preaching. They do not half of them know what duties, what sacred responsibilities, rest upon ministers to become acquainted with souls, to labor earnestly by personal effort for their salvation from house to house, coming close to hearts.",
