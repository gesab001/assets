    "word": "We received letters from Brother Whitney, who has just visited Nimes, in France. He says the tent was pitched but the lawless element has disturbed them much and the authorities are bound to protect them, but do not do it, and it is on test and trial whether a tent can be run in Nimes. They have a good working force, and if they are compelled to take down the tent they will work from house to house and make the most possible of the situation. One or two meetings have broken up in confusion. It may be the workers will decide that they will have to commence their labors in places surrounding Nimes. They have their tent pitched within a stone wall eight feet high, entered only by a gate, and they may make arrangements to shut out this rough element.",
