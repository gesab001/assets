    "word": "\"O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.\" \"Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?\" \"Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God.\" \"O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.\"",
