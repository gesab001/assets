    "word": "MR No. 211 - Personal Labor for Souls\n\n     The Lord desires that the truth shall come close to the people, and this work can only be accomplished by personal labor. . . . Let God's workers. . . teach the truth in families, drawing close to those for whom they labor. If they thus cooperate with God, He will clothe them with spiritual power. Christ will guide them in their work, entering the houses of the people with them, and giving them words to speak that will sink deep into the hearts of the listeners. The Holy Spirit will open hearts and minds to receive the rays coming from the Source of all light. . . .",
