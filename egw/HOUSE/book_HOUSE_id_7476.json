    "word": "Home education means much. It is a matter of great scope. Abraham was called the \"father of the faithful.\" Among the things that made him a remarkable example of godliness was the strict regard that in his home he paid to the commands of God. He cultivated home religion. He who sees the education given in every home, and who measures the influence of this education, said, \"I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\"",
