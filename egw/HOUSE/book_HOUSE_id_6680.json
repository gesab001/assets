We had an excellent meeting. I spoke four times during the meeting in public. Your father spoke four [times]. We both had freedom in bearing our testimonies. There is an excellent class of people raised up in Norridgewock, and in Athens a new meetinghouse has been built in both these places.--Letter 13, 1867, p. 1. (To William C.
