    "word": "Preparation for Time of Trouble \n\n     Houses and lands will be of no use to the saints in the time of trouble, for they will then have to flee before infuriated mobs, and at that time their possessions cannot be disposed of to advance the cause of present truth. I was shown that it is the will of God that the saints should cut loose from every encumbrance before the time of trouble comes, and make a covenant with God through sacrifice. If they have their property on the altar, and earnestly inquire of God for duty, He will teach them when to dispose of \n                                                                           60\nthese things. Then they will be free in the time of trouble, and have no clogs to weigh them down.",
