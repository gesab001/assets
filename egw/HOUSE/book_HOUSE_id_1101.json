Again and again the Lord has instructed that our people are to take their families away from the cities, into the country, where they can raise their own provisions; \n                                                                           10\nfor in the future the problem of buying and selling will be a very serious one. We should now begin to heed the instruction given us over and over again: Get out of the cities into rural districts, where the houses are not crowded closely together, and where you will be free from the interference of enemies.--Letter 5, 1904.",
