    "word": "Your letter only came today, and at a time when a number were about to leave our house to take passage on a steamer from Sydney to New Zealand. It was to sail at four P.M. Elder Corliss and his wife, Brother Colcord, Sister Bree, and Willie are among its passengers. Brother Sisley will go to New Zealand one week from today. Willie told me that a boat would leave for Cape Town, Africa, tomorrow. This gives me but little time in which to write to you, but I will send you copies of letters that are of importance to all.",
