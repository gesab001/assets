    "word": "Jesus gave to his disciples an example of the work they should do. In the New Testament is recorded the life of Christ and his way of working. \"And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into a house, and would have no man know it, but he could not be hid; for a certain woman, whose daughter had an unclean Spirit, came and fell at his feet.\" This woman was a Greek. Her daughter was possessed by an evil Spirit. She followed Jesus and besought him to cast the devil out of her daughter. In answer Jesus said, let the children first be filled; for it is not meat to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs. This was the sentiment of the disciples. And she answered and said unto him, yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. And He said unto her, for this saying, go thy way. The devil is gone out of thy daughter. And when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.",
