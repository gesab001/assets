    "word": "Sending His disciples forth on their first missionary tour, Christ gave them this instruction: \"And when ye come into an house, salute it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house, or city, shake the dust off your feet.
