    "word": "The 30th of May was a holy day, the second day of Pentecost, so no work in the factories was done on this day. Colors were flying from buildings and the people were pouring out in crowds to services. At five we met in Sister Doerner's house. The room was not large and was full. I spoke from John 15:1-3. Brother Conradi interpreted for me. I had considerable freedom. I had special help from the Lord, else I could not have stood on my feet. I bore a very plain testimony. This was an intelligent company to speak to. Brother Conradi mentioned a request from the afflicted brother for the prayers of the children of God. We prayed for the sick and dying brother. Brother Conradi talked for some time to those assembled.",
