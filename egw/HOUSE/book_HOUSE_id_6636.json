    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has linked himself with the world. He acted unwisely when he invited that committee of Battle Creek citizens to examine the Sanitarium books. To open these books to the inspection of the world, was as unfortunate as was Hezekiah's mistake of showing the Babylonians the treasures in the house of God.

I believe they promised to give something over thirty thousand dollars to the building fund, after that investigation. Twice thirty thousand dollars would have been but a small sum, in comparison with the harm that has been done by allowing this examination to be made.--Ms 123, 1902, p. 4.
