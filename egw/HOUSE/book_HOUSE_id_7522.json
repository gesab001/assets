But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellowservants (who are watching and giving meat in due season), and to eat and drink with the drunken (to absorb his mind and time in this world's enterprises and turn away from the service of God); the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, \n\n\n                                    -389- \n\nand appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth\" (Matthew 24:46-51).",
