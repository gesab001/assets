    "word": "We would be pleased to have Emma with us this summer, and you also, Edson, whenever this is possible. With our horses we can drive wherever we please. In the heat of summer I shall go, with Sara to accompany me, to Lake View, and then I hope you will be able to go with me. There is a fine hotel soon to be opened a few miles from the house where we made our home. \n\n\n                                    -266- \n\nWith the horses and carriages we have we could make the journey in comfort, and you could be delighted with such scenery as I think you have never before seen. This is all I need to say on this subject, except to repeat that we have plenty of house room. If Emma's sister should accompany you, we will welcome her also.",
