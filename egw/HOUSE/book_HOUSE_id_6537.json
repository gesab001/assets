    "word": "I put the robe upon her and urged her to go into the water. She hesitated. We looked up in faith to God. My husband on one side and myself upon the other and her father entreating her, we tried to encourage her along, yet her peculiar dread of water caused her to shrink. We persuaded her to move to the edge of the water and have her hands and head wet. She complied. . . . Her head and hands were wet, and then she moved forward while the administrator several times repeated these words, \"In the name of the Lord, move forward.\" Calmly she went into the water and was buried in the likeness of Christ's death. Calmly she came up out of the water. . . . We all rejoiced that we did not consent to let the child go. . . . The next morning she came to the house of Brother Day where we tarried. . . . She expressed her joy that we did not leave her to her fears. . . . We rejoiced with her that she had obtained so precious a victory.",
