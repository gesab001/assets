    "word": "Christ's work for the paralytic is an illustration of the way in which we are to work. This man had been told by his friends of the mighty healer, and he had faith to believe that he could be healed. His friends carried him to the house where Jesus was teaching, but the crowd was so great that they could not find entrance. Then the sick man suggested that they remove part of the roof, and let him down into the room. This they did, and when Jesus saw the sufferer lying before him, what was His first work? It was to give him peace of mind. The Saviour knew that the paralytic had been tortured by the suggestions of the priests that God had cast him off for his sins.",
