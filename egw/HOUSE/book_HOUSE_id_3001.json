    "word": "Well would it be for old and young to ponder those words of Scripture that show how the place marked by God\u2019s special presence should be regarded. \u201cPut off thy shoes from off thy feet,\u201d He commanded Moses at the burning bush, \u201cfor the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\u201d Jacob, after beholding the vision of the angels, exclaimed, \u201cThe Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. . . . This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\u201d(Gospel Workers, 178, 179.)",
