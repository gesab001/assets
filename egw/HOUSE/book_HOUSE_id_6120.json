    "word": "If the publishing house at Battle Creek had kept clear from all encroachments upon the rights of others, the responsible men would have had a decidedly different record in the books of heaven. The record of the books is soon to be opened. The time is at hand when the vision of the prophets is to be fulfilled: \"And I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found \n\n\n                   -8- \n\nno place for them.\" Daniel, speaking of the destruction of earthly kingdoms, says: \"In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold: the great God hath made known . . . what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.\" \"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God: and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them; and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\"",
