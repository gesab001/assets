    "word": "Not all in this world have taken sides with the enemy against God. Not all have become disloyal. There are a faithful few who are true to God; for John writes: \"Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\" Revelation 14:12. Soon the battle will be waged fiercely between those who serve God and those who serve Him not. Soon everything that can be shaken will be shaken, \n                                                                           16\nthat those things that cannot be shaken may remain.",
