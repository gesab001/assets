{"word": "The worshiper of God will find that he cannot cherish one fiber of the root of selfishness. He cannot do his duty to his God and practice oppression toward his fellow men. The second principle of the law is like unto the first, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" \"This do and thou shalt live.\" These are the words of Jesus Christ from which there can be no departure on the part of any man, woman, or youth who would be a true Christian. It is obedience to the principles of the commandments of God, that molds the character after the divine similitude. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 52}
