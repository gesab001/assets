{"word": "Individuality in Christian Experience to Be Preserved.--Teach every soul to lean heavily on the arm of infinite power. There is an individuality in Christian experience that must be preserved in every human agent, and the responsibility cannot be removed from any soul. Each one has his own battles to fight, his own Christian experience to gain, independent in some respects from any other soul; and God has lessons for each to gain for himself that no other can gain for him.--MS 6, 1889.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 430}
