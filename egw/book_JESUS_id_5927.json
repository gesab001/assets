{"word": "NOTE 2. PAGE 54.\\97IN THE TWELFTH CHAPTER OF REVELATION WE HAVE AS A SYMBOL A GREAT RED DRAGON. IN THE NINTH VERSE OF THAT CHAPTER THIS SYMBOL IS EXPLAINED AS FOLLOWS: \\93AND THE GREAT DRAGON WAS CAST OUT, THAT OLD SERPENT, CALLED THE DEVIL, AND SATAN, WHICH DECEIVETH THE WHOLE WORLD; HE WAS CAST OUT INTO THE EARTH, AND HIS ANGELS WERE CAST OUT WITH HIM.\\94 UNDOUBTEDLY THE DRAGON PRIMARILY REPRESENTS SATAN. BUT SATAN DOES NOT APPEAR UPON THE \n680\nEARTH IN PERSON; HE WORKS THROUGH AGENTS. IT WAS IN THE PERSON OF WICKED MEN THAT HE SOUGHT TO DESTROY JESUS AS SOON AS HE WAS BORN. WHEREVER SATAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL A GOVERNMENT SO FULLY THAT IT WOULD CARRY OUT HIS DESIGNS, THAT NATION BECAME, FOR THE TIME, SATAN'S REPRESENTATIVE. THIS WAS THE CASE WITH ALL THE GREAT HEATHEN NATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, SEE EZEKIEL 28, WHERE SATAN IS REPRESENTED AS ACTUAL KING OF TYRE. THIS WAS BECAUSE HE FULLY CONTROLLED THAT GOVERNMENT. IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA, ROME, OF ALL THE PAGAN NATIONS, WAS SATAN'S CHIEF AGENT IN OPPOSING THE GOSPEL, AND WAS THEREFORE REPRESENTED BY THE DRAGON.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 679}
