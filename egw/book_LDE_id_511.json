{"word": "The people of God will recognize human government as an ordinance of divine appointment and will by precept and example teach obedience to it as a sacred duty so long as its authority is exercised within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the claims of God we must choose to obey God rather than men. The Word of God must be recognized and obeyed as an authority above that of all human legislation. \"Thus saith the Lord\" is not to be set aside for a \"Thus saith the church or the state.\"  The crown of Christ is to be uplifted above all the diadems of earthly potentates.--HM Nov. 1, 1893.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 142}
