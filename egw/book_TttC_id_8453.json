    "word": "When David sinned against Uriah and his wife, he pleaded before God for forgiveness. He declares: \"Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in Thy sight.\" All wrong done to others reaches back from the injured one to God. Therefore David seeks for pardon, not from a priest, but from the Creator of man. He prays: \"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy loving-kindness: according unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.\"",
