    "word": "Move out in this work, my brethren in Australasia. \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" Hebrews 11:1. Have we not proved this in the past? As we have moved out, trusting God's promise, things unseen, except by the eye of faith, have become things seen.

The evidence we have of the faithfulness of His promises \n                                                                           474\nshould check every thought of unbelief. It is a sin to doubt, and we do not believe that our brethren in Australasia will be guilty of this.",
