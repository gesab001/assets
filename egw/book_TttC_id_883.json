    "word": "The popular ministry cannot successfully resist spiritualism. They have nothing wherewith to shield their flocks from its baleful influence. Much of the sad result of spiritualism will rest upon ministers of this age; for they have trampled the truth under their feet, and in its stead have preferred fables.

It is the foundation of spiritualism. The word of God nowhere teaches that the soul of man is immortal.

Amen.\"",
