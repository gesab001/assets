    "word": "9. Battle Creek, Michigan (?), Early 1891 (?) [THIS \n           ENTRY IS PRECEDED BY THE WORDS \"A LETTER WRITTEN FROM \n           SALAMANCA, NOV. 3, 1890\" (DIARY, P. 450). HOWEVER, SINCE \n           IT FOLLOWS THE ENTRY FOR DEC. 31, 1890 (DIARY, PP. 447-449), \n           IT PROBABLY WAS WRITTEN AFTER THAT DATE. THE WORDS \"A LETTER \n           WRITTEN FROM\" APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ADDED AT A LATER DATE WHEN \n           IT MAY ACTUALLY HAVE SLIPPED ELLEN WHITE'S MIND AS TO \n           EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS WHEN SHE PENNED THESE LINES. THE \n           NOV. 3 DATE DOUBTLESS REFERS TO THE SUBJECT UNDER \n           DISCUSSION, NOT THE DATE OF WRITING. WE DO NOT KNOW WHEN \n           THIS ACCOUNT WAS WRITTEN. \n\n\n     I had a very marked experience which I hope never to forget. Through the night season I was in communion with God. I was taken out of and away from myself, and was in different states and assemblies, bearing a decided testimony of reproof and warning.",
