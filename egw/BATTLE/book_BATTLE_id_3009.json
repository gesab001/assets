    "word": "Jesus is acquainted with every heart that is humble, meek, and lowly. These have trials and \n\n\n                        -23- \n\nmake mistakes, but they are broken-hearted because they grieve the Saviour, who loved them and died for them. They come humbly to his feet; they fight his battles. In meekness and lowliness of heart they seek to do good to others. They seek to advance the cause of truth, in good and earnest endeavor.",
