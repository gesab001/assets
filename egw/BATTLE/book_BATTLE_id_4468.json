    "word": "The work in Battle Creek, and in the state of Michigan is far, far behind. For several years there has been on the part of the Conference Committee and the laborers, a want of wise planning and discreet management in regard to it. While the president of the General Conference was willing to do much work, he did not see the necessity of training the powers of mind and qualifying himself to plan to discern the talents of young men and set them to work, associating with himself those who could help him. It is well to see and understand the situation, and the needs of foreign missions, so as not to neglect them, we should also be able to comprehend the needs of the work at our very doors. Home missions should not be neglected. There has been an oversight in doing this.",
