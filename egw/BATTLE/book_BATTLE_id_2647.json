    "word": "The Lord permitted the Battle Creek Sanitarium to be consumed, but was it that you should erect in Battle Creek a larger sanitarium? I know that this is not the purpose of God. In making plans so large that in order for them to be carried to completion you will feel that means must be gathered from every possible source, you are not following God's way. The plans are not his, but yours. Be assured that there needs to be a reformation before you can be an acceptable co-laborer with God. \n                                                                           40",
