    "word": "St. Helena, Cal., Oct. 16, 1900. \n     Much has been said on this line [on the line of selling the Battle Creek College and having the school moved out of Battle Creek], but for years \n                                                                           30\nnothing has been done. Had this movement been made when the Lord indicated that it was duty, the showing would be very different from what it is at the present time. But circumstances have changed, and the movements that might have been made with advantage in the past will not at this time be advisable. All the reasons I shall not attempt to lay before you. Many things will be revealed in the future that are not discerned now. . . .",
