    "word": "Now, Brother Church, I have presented only a few items before you. We learned that Dr. Maxson \n\n\n                                     -365- \n\nand wife were closely united with Elder Rice and always ready to excuse his course. Dr. Maxson denied to me that Elder Rice had been as imprudent as had been stated. I said, \"Dr. Maxson, I have talked with Mrs. Heald and received from her own lips the statements to be true, which you claim to be untrue.\" An unholy bond has connected these together to the injury of all parties. This has stood directly in the way of Elder Rice's receiving the very reproofs and corrections the Lord had for him. Dr. Maxson has done this before in Battle Creek, and it grieved me to the heart to see that he would be on the wrong side in this case.",
