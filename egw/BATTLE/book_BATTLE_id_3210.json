    "word": "I have been shown that it was impossible that there should be any better state of things in the future until clean work is made in the past. For if matters are partially settled, these feelings, opinions and views will be liable to occur again. The cause of God is in a critical state, and unless there is now thorough work made there will be another door open for Satan to come in again and take the lead of matters to suit himself. Never can there be any degree of union with you in this work in the Office until wrong links and influences are broken, ties and sympathies that have been misplaced severed, and a thorough acknowledgment of God's work in the past. But as matters now stand there is no safety, no bars to keep Satan out. And is the work of God to go on thus? Bitter have been your feelings. I dare not smooth over matters. The time has come when we must know who is on the Lord's side. The cause of God calls for immediate action. And those who cannot endure the smallest test of their fidelity now, what will \n                                                                           21\nthey do when the dragon host is at war with those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus? The feelings of Jenette and Angeline have not been in union with the work of God. They have chosen to believe that their course and ways have been right, rather than to believe the visions. But the time will soon come when they will be compelled to see matters as they are, when the past will be too late for remedy. I repeat, there has been a perfect chain of dissatisfaction from Paris to Battle Creek. I saw that you could help in the cause of God if you were right; but in your present state, with your feelings, you would only be a curse.",
