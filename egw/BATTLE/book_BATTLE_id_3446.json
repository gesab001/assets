    "word": "Now God requires of His people to carry out the truth they profess. There are many of them poor and cannot obtain conveniences, yet He enjoins upon them strict cleanliness and order. God is no less particular now than when He gave directions to the children of Israel to observe cleanliness \"lest the Lord pass by and see their uncleanness\" and would not go up with their armies to battle against their enemies. These stumbling blocks must be moved out of the way. God requires cleanliness of person, neatness of dress, and order and cleanliness in your houses, or God will not bless you, and you will be a hindrance to the cause of God.--Letter 11, 1861, pp. 1, 2. (To \"Dear Friends,\" December 1861.)",
