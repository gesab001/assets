We pray most earnestly for you every day. I have freedom in prayer. We do not forget Brethren [A. D.] Olsen and [J. G.] Matteson and others who are afflicted. We pray; it is all we can do. Then we leave you in humble trust in the hands of One who loves you with a greater love than a mother's. Cling to Jesus and put your entire trust in Him, for He careth for you and He will not withdraw His hand from you, but will lead you Himself.",
