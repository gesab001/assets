    "word": "Norwich, Connecticut, Friday, November 28, 1890 \n\n     I am quite comfortable today. Wrote many pages to send to Battle Creek to be read during the week of prayer. We rode out to Norwichtown, Conn., three miles. Purchased cloth shoes, for my feet are cold and I dare not continue to have them cold. I was pleased to get back to my place where I was entertained. I spoke in the evening from John 14. \"If ye love me keep my commandments,\" etc. There was not a large number present. I had a measure of freedom in speaking. Brother Robinson and Farman came to this place last night at eleven o'clock.--Ms. 49, 1890, p. 3 (Diary 16, p. 347).",
