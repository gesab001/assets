I want them. They can be packed in a box of books coming to Australia. There are other books. I would appreciate Horace Mann, but you look over my books and tell me in regard to them. What property have I in Battle Creek? Will you just ascertain? I do not know as you can read this scribbling. If you can, I shall be pleased.--Letter 243, 1899, p. 2. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. April 11, 1985",
