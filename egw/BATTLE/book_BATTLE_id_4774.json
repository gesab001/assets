    "word": "Ponder well the paths of your feet. Be swift to hear, slow to speak. You may indeed feel that you are on holy ground. The Lord has a controversy with his people. If you look to God and trust to him, you will make no miscarriage of your life; for our precious Saviour is full of grace and truth. You may be looked upon with suspicion and distrust, but I fully believe that in the providence of God your stay at Battle Creek will be a precious school for you. At all times reveal the meekness and lowliness of Christ. \"Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" Let your fruit be unto righteousness and true holiness.",
