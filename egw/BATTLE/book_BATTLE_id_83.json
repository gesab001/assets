    "word": "John also was a witness of the terrible scenes that will take place as signs of Christ\u2019s coming. He saw armies mustering for battle, and people\u2019s hearts failing them for fear. He saw the earth moved out of its place, the mountains carried into the midst of the sea, the waves thereof roaring and troubled. He saw the vials of wrath opened, and pestilence, famine, and death come upon the inhabitants of the earth.",
