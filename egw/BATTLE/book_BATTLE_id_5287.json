    "word": "Elder Daniells and Elder Prescott have made some mistakes. But a grave mistake was made when you and Elder A. T. Jones set yourselves to the defense of the movement for the reopening of the Battle Creek College, the full results of which neither of you understand. The Lord did not inspire the words spoken in defense of that movement, and the criticisms which were made against the attitude of the men who felt it their duty to point out the dangers attending the effort to bring a large number of our youth to Battle Creek. Another counsellor had taken the place of the divine Counsellor.",
