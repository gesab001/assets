After a pleasant and profitable visit with our friends at the Chicago mission, and a lay-over of five hours at Lawrence, Kan., we arrived at Forest Park, Ottawa, at eight o'clock, Tuesday evening. The workers' meeting had been in progress several days. Through the kindness of Bro. and sister Rousseau, who gave up their nicely furnished tent for our accommodation, we were pleasantly situated throughout the meeting.",
