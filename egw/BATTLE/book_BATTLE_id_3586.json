    "word": "It was hoped that much good would be done by preparing food for worldlings, that thereby many would be brought to a knowledge of the truth. And this might have been, had the glory of God been kept in view.

(To the Elders of the Battle Creek Church, and to Ministers and Physicians, July 5, 1906.)",
