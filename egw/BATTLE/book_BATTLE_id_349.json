    "word": "Elder _____ came to me, and asked me if he ought to give the young man encouragement to think that he would be given a place in the office. I said, \"The God of heaven has presented before him the eternal weight of glory that awaits the overcomer, and if like Moses, he has respect unto the recompense of reward, he will take his position decidedly on the side of truth. \n                                                                           245\nBut it would do harm and not good to hold out before him any bribe or attraction. And yet your duty is to help him to see that he must walk out by faith, but do not leave him to wrestle this battle out alone, for Satan will tempt him, and you must render him every help possible.\"--Manuscript 26, 1886.",
