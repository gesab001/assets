    "word": "Lansing, Mich., Friday, January 16, 1891 \n\n     We left Battle Creek at five a.m. en route for Lansing. I awoke at half past two o'clock and could not sleep after this awakening. Arose at three a.m. At four awakened Sara and Andrew to prepare the team to take us to the cars. I was unable to take anything except a cup of gruel and a little bread. We were about one hour coming to Lansing, but for some reason I cannot define, my heart troubled me so that I felt great exhaustion. We rode in a streetcar to the hotel. We were carried two blocks past and were obliged to walk back.",
