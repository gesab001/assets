    "word": "These who come to Battle Creek from other places are grieved and astonished to see the lack of simplicity in dress in the Battle Creek church, and the disregard of the testimonies in reference to the reform dress. They find this church even behind those of other places who have not had a tenth part of the light on the subject of dress reform that the church in Battle Creek have had. The Health Reform Institute is located in Battle Creek, and gives its influence to the reform dress, and there is but a small cross in wearing the reform dress in Battle Creek compared with other places.",
