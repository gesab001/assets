    "word": "The Work at Battle Creek. \n\n     In a vision given me at Bordoville, Vt., Dec. 10, 1871, I was shown that the position of my husband has been a very difficult one. The pressure of care and labor has been upon him. His brethren in the ministry have not had these burdens to bear, and they have not appreciated his labors. The constant pressure upon him has taxed him mentally and physically. I was shown his position to the people of God was similar, in some respects, to that of Moses to Israel. There were murmurers against Moses, when in adverse circumstances, and there have been murmurers against him.",
