    "word": "God will hold men accountable who have the plain teachings of His Word, but disregard them and accept the sayings and customs of men. And yet how many are doing this! They reject the light in regard to the Sabbath, and trample upon God's holy day. Ministers and people, with the Bible open before them, show contempt for the Word of God in His holy precepts, while they exalt a spurious sabbath, which has no other foundation than the authority of the Roman church. The claims of this spurious sabbath are to be enforced upon the world. The Protestant churches, having received doctrines which the Word of God condemns, will bring these to the front and force them upon the consciences of men, just as the papal authorities urged their dogmas upon the advocates of truth in Luther's time. The same battle is again to be fought, and every soul will be called upon to decide upon which side of the controversy he will be found.--Ms 100, 1893, pp. 6, 7, 9.
