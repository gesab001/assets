    "word": "Not because we first loved Him, does God love us; but \"while we were yet sinners\" (Romans 5:8) Christ died for us, making full and abundant provision for our redemption. Although by our disobedience we have merited God's displeasure and condemnation, He has not forsaken us; He has not left us to grapple with the power of the enemy in our own finite strength. Heavenly angels fight our battles for us; and co-operating with them, we may be victorious over the powers of evil. Trusting in Christ as our personal Saviour, we may be \"more than conquerors through him that loved us\" (Romans 8:37).",
