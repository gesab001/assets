The Setting \n\n     ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO, IN 1876, JAMES AND ELLEN WHITE WERE BUILDING A NEW HOME ON THE CORNER OF 11TH AND CASTRO STREETS IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. THEY HAD MOVED TO CALIFORNIA FROM BATTLE CREEK, MICHIGAN, TWO YEARS EARLIER IN ORDER TO FOUND A NEW PUBLISHING HOUSE AND BEGIN PUBLICATION OF THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES MAGAZINE. IN 1876 AMERICA TURNED 100, JAMES WHITE HAD HIS FIFTY-FIFTH BIRTHDAY, AND ELLEN WHITE HER FORTY-NINTH. ALTHOUGH THEIR TWO LIVING SONS WERE BOTH MARRIED, ELDER AND MRS. WHITE STILL HAD A LARGE FAMILY. THE YOUNGER SON, WILLIE, (AGE 21) AND HIS BRIDE, MARY KELSEY WHITE (AGE 19), WERE LIVING WITH THEM. MRS. WHITE'S TWO LITTLE GRAND-NIECES, ADDIE AND MAY WALLING (ABOUT 9 AND 6), WERE PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD. MARY CLOUGH, AUNTIE OF THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS, WAS MRS. WHITE'S EDITORIAL ASSISTANT. JOHN SHEW, A CHINESE BOY, DID ALL THE COOKING AND MUCH OF THE OTHER WORK. FINALLY, THERE WAS MRS. RICE, THE SEAMSTRESS, WHO OFTEN DOUBLED AS A FULL-TIME BABY-SITTER FOR THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS. NEARBY, IN THEIR OWN HOME, LIVED ELDER AND MRS. WHITE'S OLDER SON, EDSON (AGE 26) WITH HIS WIFE, EMMA.",
