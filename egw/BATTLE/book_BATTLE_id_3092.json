    "word": "Many of you at Battle Creek are living without prayer, without thoughts of Christ, and without exalting him before those around you. You have no words to exalt Christ; you do no deeds that honor him. Many of you are as truly strangers to Christ as though you had never heard his name. You have not the peace of Christ; for you have no true ground for peace. You have no communion with God, because you are not united to Christ. Said our Saviour, \"No man cometh to the Father but by me. You are not useful in the cause of Christ. \"Except ye abide in me,\" says Jesus, \"Ye can do nothing\"--nothing in God's sight, nothing that Christ will accept at your hands. \n                                                                           24\nWithout Christ, you can have nothing but a delusive hope; for he himself declares, \"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned.\"",
