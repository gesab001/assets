    "word": "7. Date and Place of Writing Not Known [THIS ENTRY \n            APPEARS IN MRS. WHITE'S DIARY UNDER THE DATE OF \n            NOVEMBER 3, 1890. HOWEVER, FROM INTERNAL EVIDENCE IT \n            APPEARS THAT THE LINES QUOTED HERE WERE PROBABLY \n            WRITTEN SOME WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS LATER. THE PHRASE \n            \"THE SEASON OF THE YEAR WAS UNFAVORABLE\" POINTS BACK \n            TO A SUBSTANTIALLY EARLIER PERIOD. IT APPEARS THAT \n            ELLEN WHITE WROTE EVERYTHING ON P. 288 OF HER DIARY \n            AS WELL AS THE FIRST FOUR LINES OF P. 289 ON NOVEMBER \n            3. SOME TIME LATER SHE FILLED OUT THE REST OF P. 289 \n            AND, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE, REFERRED HER SECRETARY \n            TO THE BACK OF THE BOOK FOR THE BALANCE OF THE \n            ACCOUNT. THE BOTTOM LINE READS, \"LOOK AT THE LAST PART \n            OF THE BOOK HEADED SALAMANCA IMPORTANT MATTER.\" WHILE \n            PAGES 450-517 ARE NOT TITLED \"SALAMANCA,\" THEY DO CARRY \n            A LONG ACCOUNT OF THE SALAMANCA VISION.] \n\n\n     Weary in body and in much discomfort and pain, I went to my chamber, my sleeping room. I had painful feelings and thought I would be compelled to \n\n\n                                  -58- \n\nreturn to Battle Creek. The season of the year was unfavorable, the weather changeable, and the cars uncomfortably heated. This prepared us to contract colds, and it seemed presumptuous to attempt to journey from state to state.",
