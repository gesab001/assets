    "word": "I address words to the church at Battle Creek, to move in the counsels of God. There is need of your moving--many from Battle Creek--and there is also need of your having well-defined plans as to what you will do when you go out from Battle Creek. Do not go in a rush, without knowing what you are about. . . . O for generals, wise and considerate, well-balanced men, who will be safe advisers, who have some insight into human nature, who know how to direct and counsel in the fear of God.",
