[READ IN COLLEGE HALL, DECEMBER, 1881, BEFORE CONFERENCE DELEGATES AND LEADING WORKERS IN REVIEW AND HERALD OFFICE, SANITARIUM AND COLLEGE.] \n\n     There is danger that our College will be turned away from its original design. God's purpose has been made known, that our people should have an opportunity to study the sciences, and at the same time to learn the requirements of his word. Biblical lectures should be given; the study of the Scriptures should have the first place in our system of education.",
