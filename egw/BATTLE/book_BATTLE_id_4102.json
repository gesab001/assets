    "word": "The experience that you had in the wrecking of the large tent during the Battle Creek camp meeting is a sure and crowning evidence that Satan is at work. As the Lord's people show their determination to follow the light that the Lord has given, the enemy will bring all his powers to bear to discourage them. But they are not to give up because of the difficulties that arise when they try to follow the counsel of the Lord. God has given us His work to do, and if we comply with His requirements, we shall be blessed. The Lord has shown me that we shall have to meet experiences just such as have taken place.",
