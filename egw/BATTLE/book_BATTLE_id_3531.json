    "word": "Justice and righteousness have had no part in their movements. \"The way of the Lord\" has not been chosen, but their own way. They beguiled the unwary and made an easy conquest of those who love change. They are too much blinded to consider the right and wrong of this course, and too reckless to care. It has been necessary in the sanitarium at Battle Creek to make contracts binding those who connect with them as helpers, so that if they educate and train them as nurses, as bath-hands, and even advance money to some special ones that they may obtain a medical education, that they may have some use of them afterwards. Dr. Kellogg has placed hopes upon some of these that they would relieve him of responsibilities that have rested most heavily upon him. Some have become uneasy and dissatisfied because some who have started institutions in other parts of the country have tried to flatter and induce them to come to their sanitarium and they would do much better by them. In this way they have made the workers--some of them, at least--uneasy, \n\n\n                                    -130- \n\nunsettled, self-sufficient, and unreliable, even if they did not disconnect from the sanitarium, because they felt there were openings for them elsewhere.--Ms 14, 1888, pp. 6-8.
