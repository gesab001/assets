SEE 1T 97FF.] he desired to free himself from the responsibility of the publishing work. He proposed that the church take charge of the work, and that it be managed by a publishing committee whom they should appoint and that \n\n\n                                                        25 \n\nno one connected with the office derive any financial benefit therefrom beyond the wages received for his labor.",
