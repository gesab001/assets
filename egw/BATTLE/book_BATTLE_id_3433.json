    "word": "I have a spirit of prayer for the church in Battle Creek. I feel intensely for those whom we might look upon as the lost sheep, those who have been with us, but have gone out from us, and those who have been in contention. Let these souls be visited. Let special efforts be made, that the convicting Spirit of God may come upon the people.--Letter 70, 1906, p. 1. (To Brother and Sister Amadon, January 30, 1906.)",
