    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., Monday, January 19, 1891 \n\n     We left Bushnell Sunday afternoon [January 18]. Rode fifteen miles with Brother Addison Howe to Lyons. We were entertained in their family. Their little daughter was quite sick with a cold. She coughed a hoarse, harsh cough. We slept in a bedroom off the parlor. Although a fire had been kindled in an old cookstove adjoining the bedroom, the clothing of the bed and the bed itself chilled Sara and me through and through. I had chills half the night. \n                                                                           885",
