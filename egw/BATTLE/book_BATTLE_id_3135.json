    "word": "My brethren and sisters, old and young, when you have an hour of leisure, open the Bible, and store the mind with its precious truths. When engaged in labor, guard the mind, keep it stayed upon God, talk less, and meditate more. Remember, \"Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of Judgment.\" Let your words be select; this will close a door to the adversary of souls. Let your day be entered upon with prayer; work as in God's sight. His angels are ever by your \n                                                                           87\nside, making a record of your words, your deportment, and the manner in which your work is done. If you turn from good counsel, and choose to associate with those whom you have reason to suspect are not religiously inclined, although they profess to be Christians, you will soon become like them. You place yourself in the way of temptation, on Satan's battle-ground, and will, unless constantly guarded, be overcome by his devices. There are persons who have for some time made a profession of religion, who are, to all intents and purposes, without God and without a sensitive conscience. They are vain and trifling; their conversation is of a low order. Courtship and marriage occupy the mind to the exclusion of higher and nobler thoughts.",
