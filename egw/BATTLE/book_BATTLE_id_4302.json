    "word": "Cherishing Faith, Not Doubt\n\n     Sermon by Mrs. E. G. White, March, 16, 1890, Battle Creek, Michigan \n\n     I want to say a few words in reference to faith. I want to say, brethren and sisters, it is not natural for us to believe, but it is very natural for us to foster unbelief. This is the besetting sin, and has been the besetting sin of God's people. It has not been natural for me to believe for myself, and I have had very severe lessons on this point until I know that it is not safe for me to cherish for one moment any doubt. I never doubted the truth, but to cherish doubt in regard to myself and my work.",
