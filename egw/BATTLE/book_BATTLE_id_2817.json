    "word": "(First part of a Testimony from Mrs. E. G. White, \n     copied at Cooranbong, N. S. W., Nov. 21, 1899. \n     Written in Maitland, N. S. W., some time in \n     November.) \n\nDear Brethren Irwin and Haskell:-- \n     I have some things upon my mind which I must communicate to you. I will state the matter as well as I can. I have thought much, \"How can I help the school in Battle Creek, and help to wipe out that large debt?\" It came to me that the only way I could do was to make a gift of the book soon to be issued, \"The Parables.\" I wish this book to be used in the interests of all our schools. I will require no royalty, if our printing office in Battle Creek will find the material and do the work of printing and binding the book. Others can give illustrations, and those who canvass for the work can act their part by taking smaller commission. The Conference has pledged the interest on the debt, and this will help in the proposition I have made. We will all share in the act of benevolence and help the schools to help themselves out of their embarrassment. If we will all harmonize in this work, the Lord will be pleased, and the ones who act a part the Lord will bless. If the Review and Herald find the material, print and bind the book free of cost, they will be doing no more than they would have done had they given the interest on the debt. \n                                                                           19",
