    "word": "If in Africa there had been consecrated workers to push their way into unworked fields, with the full co-operation of the men who are bearing responsibilities, the influence of this work would have added large numbers to the Lord's kingdom. But the same error has been committed in Africa that was committed in Battle Creek,--a center was made in one place at a large outlay of means, while other portions of \n                                                                           1704\nthe Lord's vineyard which should have been worked were neglected. God will use in his work humble men who do not think themselves so useful that they trust to their own judgment and efficiency. In Africa there were those who because of their humility were supposed to be unable to do much. Christ worked with these men. God gave them wisdom. But supposedly wiser men bound about the work, and gave little encouragement for it to advance. The very means that was needed to enter and establish the truth in new territories was placed in America where it would not do the greatest amount of good. God has seen all this, and has presented it to me. There was need of that means in new and unworked fields in the Lord's vineyard that the standard of truth might be uplifted. Had the work been done that needed to be done, men of talent would have come to a knowledge of the truth, men who could have translated our books into different languages. Every dollar expended in America in adding building to building was needed in the fields that might have been entered but were not because many of the workers sent to South Africa were not sanctified. They were unable to take in the situation. They were not willing to deny self, lift the cross, and follow where Jesus led the way.",
