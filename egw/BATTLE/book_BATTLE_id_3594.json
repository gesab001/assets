    "word": "But I have to venture something, of course I do. I have to venture and venture by faith upon the loving promises of God, and believe that they will be verified to me. Christ ventured a great deal when He came here to stand upon the battlefield, when He came here clothed with humanity, standing as our surety, as our substitute, that He would overcome in our behalf, that we might be overcomers in His strength and by His merits. Well, now it seems such a venture that He made for us. And cannot we venture something for Him? Cannot we say, \"I will go unto my Saviour, and if I perish, I perish. I will perish at His feet? Then let us make a venture. Make a surrender to God. Let self be broken all to pieces.",
