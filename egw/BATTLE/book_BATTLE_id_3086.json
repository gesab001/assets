    "word": "The Sabbath-school at Battle Creek runs like a well-regulated machine, but there is too little of the real heartwork which alone can make the school a success. More of God's presence and less of merely human effort would be a great improvement. If a portion of the thought and time given to the mechanical workings, were devoted to the spiritual interests of teachers and pupils, a better effect would be produced. More piety and devotion, and more of the simplicity of godliness are essential. The same change is needful in the College--less of self, and more of the Spirit of God.",
