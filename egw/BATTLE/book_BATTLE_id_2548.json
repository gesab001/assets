    "word": "Let those in different countries walk by faith. Let them inquire, Am I serving the men at Battle Creek, or am I serving the Lord? They are to feel their individual accountability to God, not to men who give evidence that they themselves need to seek the Lord for wisdom. As the Lord's \n\n\n                        - 34 - \n\ndelegated servants seek him for wisdom, he will answer their prayers. Those in distant countries who are on the ground should consult together, pray together, opening the word of God for counsel. Where two or three are agreed together, this word declares, as touching anything they shall ask in the name of Jesus, it shall be done for them. \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" Bow down before God. With reverential awe approach the throne of grace. Present the word of God, which is \"not Yea and Nay, but Yea and Amen, in Christ Jesus.\"",
