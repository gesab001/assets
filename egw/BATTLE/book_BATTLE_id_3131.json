    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has obtained an experience in economy. This was the battle of life with him. But he should not let the habit of close figuring, which was a necessity in his youth, degenerate into avarice and sharp practice. While he is liberal with the money he gains, he is in danger of scheming, and the fine gold of his character will thus be tarnished. While he sees the advantages to be gained by a certain course of action, he does not always look to see how it will affect others. But he can afford to be fair and square in deal. Better, far better, to yield some advantages that might be gained, than to cultivate an avaricious spirit, and thus make it a law of nature.",
