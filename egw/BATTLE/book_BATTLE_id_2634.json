    "word": "When the Lord swept the large Sanitarium out of the way at Battle Creek, he did not design that it should ever be built there again. But in their blindness men went ahead and rebuilt the institution where it now stands. Years ago message after message was given, pointing out that the Sanitarium in Battle Creek was too large, that plants should be made in different places, that memorials should be established in many places, so that the light of present truth might shine forth. Had this counsel been heeded, the heavy responsibilities connected with the Battle Creek Sanitarium would not now exist. These responsibilities are a terrible burden. This institution should have been divided into several parts. But the light that had been given regarding this was not followed.",
