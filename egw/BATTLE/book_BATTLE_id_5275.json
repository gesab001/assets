    "word": "In Oakland, there was spread before me a long, lawyer-framed document, filled with technicalities, which document was a copy of the conditions under which the Sanitarium issued bonds. The provisions of this bond issue were such that money gathered in from all parts of the country is tied up in the medical institution at Battle Creek for a long period of time. Our people should never have been expected to tie up so great an amount of money as was needed to rebuild the large Sanitarium there. It was not right to endeavor to gather in means to make sure of a great work in one place, irrespective of other parts of the field. The Lord presented before me many places where small sanitariums were to be established. One is greatly needed near Nashville, at some point convenient to the large educational institutions in the suburbs of this Southern city. In many other places where medical missionary work has not yet been established, there is urgent need of small medical institutions.",
