W. \n                             March 13, 1896. \n     In the night season I was listening to one who spoke with authority. Words of counsel in regard to the responsibilities that are to be borne in the sacred work of God were spoken. The Teacher said, There should be no haphazard work. Much of this has been done. Men have assumed authority, but the people should not depend upon poor, finite, erring men. They should put their entire trust in the wisdom that finds its strength in the wisdom of God. The inconsistency of centering so many responsibilities in Battle Creek has been presented many times, but the counsels have not been acted upon  The reproofs and warnings from the Lord have been evaded and interpreted and made void by the devices of men. There has been counter-working against God, and the judgment of men has been received.",
