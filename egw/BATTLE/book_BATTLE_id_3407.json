    "word": "MR No. 256 - Labor in Unity\n\n     The work committed to us by the Lord will advance rapidly only when we labor in unity. . . . \"Yes,\" says one, \"this is exactly what I believe in--consolidation.\" But Christian unity is not what the world calls consolidation. Unity among brethren results in consolidation with Christ and with the heavenly angels. Such consolidation is heaven-born.--Letter 67, 1903, p. 1. (To \"Our Brethren Assembled at the Medical Missionary Council at Battle Creek,\" April 23, 1903.)",
