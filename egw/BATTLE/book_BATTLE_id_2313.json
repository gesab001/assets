    "word": "1 T.--514 \n     Let several families living in a city or village unite and leave the occupations which have taxed them physically and mentally, and make an excursion into the country, to the side of a fine lake, or to a nice grove, where the scenery of nature is beautiful. They should provide themselves with plain, hygienic food, the very best fruits and grains, and spread their table under the shade of some tree or under the canopy of heaven. The ride, the exercise, and the scenery will quicken the appetite, and they can enjoy a repast which kings might envy.  {TSDF 105.10}  \n\nChapter 25 - Hygienic Restaurants\n\n                                                       MS.--27--'06 \n     When the state fair was held in Battle Creek, our people took with them onto the grounds three or four cooking stoves, and demonstrated how good meals might be prepared without the use of flesh-meat. We were told that we set the best table on the ground. Whenever large gatherings are held, it is your privilege to devise plans whereby you can provide those who attend with wholesome food, and you are to make your efforts educational.",
