    "word": "Elder Haskell, the reason our ministers are so inefficient is because they go to their work and come from their labors, if they have any success, full of themselves. The disciples of Christ did this when they said, \"Even the spirits are subject unto us.\" Jesus could discern their danger, and He said, \"Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile.\" Come out of the din of battle, away from the conflict, and hold communion with God. Thus it is with many workers. They are too strong, too full of self. The Lord cannot lead them or teach them or use them to His glory, for they are wise in their own conceits, and vainly imagine that the Lord cannot do without them. Self must be buried. We must educate the people to seek the Lord. We must speak plain words to ministers who are walking in the sparks of their own kindling. \n\n\n                                    -338-",
