Misunderstandings have arisen because the ministerial branch of the work did not give its whole strength to other work. Everything that Satan can do he will do to multiply the responsibilities of Dr. Kellogg, for he knows that this means weakness instead of strength to the institution. Great consideration must be exercised. There are other institutions to take the babies and abandoned women to care for them. This work is being done by other parties.",
