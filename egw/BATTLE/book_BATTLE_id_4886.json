    "word": "Christian fathers and mothers are now called upon to fulfill their duties in the home. They must try to save their children unto eternal life. Let them not advise their children to connect with the Sanitarium at Battle Creek, or with the schools that shall be set in operation at Battle Creek. There is tenfold more danger now in our youth going there, than there has been in any period in the past.",
