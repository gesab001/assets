    "word": "Sunnyside, Cooranbong, N. S. W., June 16, 1899 \nDear Children, Edson and Emma White: \n\n\n     I have been writing out some matters in reference to the South. I have read your letters to Brother Irwin and myself. Prior to this I had written in my diary in regard to yourself and Emma. The light that I have is that you should have a change. W. C. White and I have been consulting together, and from the light given me this burden resting upon you cannot be born with the want of cooperation evidenced. There is a spirit cherished among men at Battle Creek, those not standing in the position where they can be worked by the Holy Spirit, that they will think they see something to criticise in you, and then this is made an excuse why they do not feel a burden to do what they would otherwise do in the work in which you are engaged.",
