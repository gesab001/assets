    "word": "I tell you in the name of the Lord, Advance no farther in your work of loading down by bearing such institutions as the Health Retreat. Take your hands off from the Pacific Press. . . . You cannot retrieve your past record by seeking to reconstruct, reorganize, and consolidate other institutions with the institutions so defective in Battle Creek. I cry to you in the name of the Lord, No, No. Leave the Pacific Press under God's theocracy, and humble your hearts before God before it is everlastingly too late.--Ms 7, 1897, pp. 5, 6. (Untitled, Jan. 27, 1897.)",
