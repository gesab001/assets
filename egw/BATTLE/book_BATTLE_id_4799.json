O. A. Olsen, \n     Battle Creek, Michigan, U.S.A. \n\nMy dear brother:- \n     I have received your letter of April 24, and have just read it. I feel very deeply for you, my brother. I hardly know just what I ought to send to you. I have communications which have been written for one and two years, but I have thought that for your sake they ought to be withheld until some one could stand by your side who could clearly distinguish Bible principles from principles of human manufacture, who, with sharp discernment could separate the strangely perverted, human imaginations, which have been working for years, from things of divine origin.",
