    "word": "The arrangement of the General Conference to take the supervision of the publishing work, will not remove the difficulties that have existed, unless there is a decided renunciation of the principles and methods which are not in the wisdom of God, nor for the interests of the work. Methods which God does not approve have leavened the minds of men who do not discern the outcome of these ambitious plans. They give their assent to that of which they know very little. I fear that the managers of the Pacific Press have accepted propositions without the careful and \n\n\n                  -10- \n\nprayerful consideration which should have been given them. No proposition should be accepted, no matter whence it may come, unless it is definitely stated in writing, and a copy given to the managers of each institution. Then let several of the leading men together bring the matter before the Lord; spread out the writing before Him, and with earnest prayer seek for clear discernment and sharp discrimination to decide whether the plans proposed are for the glory of God and the good of both institutions. As you ask for wisdom, believe that you receive, and you shall have; for God has promised it. ----- ----- may, with the purest motives, make propositions that have no appearance of injustice toward any institution outside of Battle Creek, but the terms in which the propositions are made may mean much more than is apparent to the Pacific Press managers. Some of the men on the other side have purposes in view which they do not clearly define. From the light I have had, the Pacific Press has consented to accept propositions that will open the way for still others, and may bring results which its managers do not now foresee. I write this in order that no hurried motions shall be carried through, but that every point may be carefully and prayerfully considered, with its probable results.",
