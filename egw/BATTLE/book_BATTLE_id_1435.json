    "word": "A view given me September 7th\n     At Oswego, (N.Y.), the Lord shewed me that there must be a great work done for his people before they could stand in the battle in the day of the Lord. I was pointed to those who claim to be Adventists, but reject the present truth, and saw that they were crumbling, and that the hand of the Lord was in their midst to divide and scatter them now in the gathering time, so that the precious jewels among them, that have formerly been deceived, may have their eyes opened to see their true state. And now when the truth is presented to them by the Lord's messengers, they will be prepared to listen, and see its beauty and harmony, and leave their former associates, and errors, and embrace the precious truth, and stand where they can define their position.",
