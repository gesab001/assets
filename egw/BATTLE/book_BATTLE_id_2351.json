    "word": "Cry to God in faith, that He may pour out His light and His grace through the channels which He has appointed for good to those who are suffering for want of knowledge. While you pray and watch with earnest diligence to suppress wrong and stand guard against dissipation and fashionable errors, lay hold by living faith of the strength which may be yours to bless all your labors. You may gather light, knowledge, and power; and your influence may be diffusive. . . . Every responsibility you bear will fortify and strengthen you to make renewed efforts and push forward the work successfully.--Letter 4a, Jan. 12, 1879, to two young physicians at Battle Creek Sanitarium.",
