Amadon, \n     Battle Creek, Michigan \n\nDear Brother Amadon: \n\n\n     We have heard of the calamity that overtook you during the Battle Creek camp meeting, in the wrecking of the large tent. This news does not surprise us; for the prince of the power of the air will do strange things in his efforts to hinder God's people; and much more in the future than he has in the past.",
