Sept. 17, 1890 \n\nDear Brethren in the Ministry: \n     Who shall assemble in camp-meeting in Oakland: I am deeply interested in the cause of God and greatly desire its success upon the Pacific coast. Since our return from Europe, there has been a state of things existing in California as well as east of the Rocky Mountains that has made my work fifty times harder than it otherwise would have been. Now there have been causes that have produced a condition of things that are very displeasing to God.",
