    "word": "From the very last letter I sent to Battle Creek, but a few weeks ago, I read the testimony, \"The money spent in enlarging the institutions in Battle Creek might far better be devoted to planting the truth in places where it had not yet taken hold.\" Money has been entrusted to human agents to be invested, to be put out to the exchanger and increased by use. Again and again the men in positions of trust have had laid before them the necessity that the Lord's vineyard be more equally worked. Places in the very shadow of Battle Creek are overlooked. The field is the world. Every part of it is the Lord's, and should receive due attention. No one locality is to swallow up every resource that can be obtained to multiply its facilities while the larger parts of the field are left destitute. This policy is not inspired of God. The gracious calls of mercy are to be given to all parts of the world.",
