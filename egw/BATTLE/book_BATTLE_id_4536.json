Oct. 29, 1889 \n\nDear Daughter Mary: \n     I have sent in this some seersucker, plaid, thinking it would be good and strong for aprons. I send you that thick woolen goods to use as you may think best. I have knit a pair of wristers for Ella. Will knit a pair for Mabel if I can and send soon. I think you will need a mattress, cotton top mattress which I will send by Brother Gates. I told Reba to be sure and write to me just what you needed in quilts or in bedding, mattresses. I have received no line from her. Perhaps she forgot it but let me know about it if you can as soon as possible.",
