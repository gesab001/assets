    "word": "As Satan failed utterly in his attempt to cause Christ to sin, so he will fail of overcoming us, if we will act sensibly, in accordance with the light given in God's Word. Years ago I made up my mind that when the enemy tempted me to speak hastily because I felt that I was treated unjustly and wickedly, I would not open my lips. If I should speak even one word in reply, the enemy would be almost sure to gain the victory. We must learn to keep silent. In silence there is eloquence. When fighting battles with the forces of darkness, let us keep our tongues bridled. Then we shall be victorious.",
