    "word": "MR No. 1505 - Train Canvassers; Stay Away From Large Centers; Keep a Tranquil Mind, Looking Constantly to Jesus\n\n     (Written May 21, 1903, from St. Helena, California, to E.R. Palmer.) \n\n     In the past I have felt perplexed about saying to you all that I desired to say, for I feared that you would not understand me. I now wish to say that had not the Review and Herald been destroyed, the plans that you and Elder Daniells were forming would have made it necessary for me to say many things to counteract what you were working to accomplish. In your feelings of opposition to the proper development of the smaller printing offices, and your desire to bring much of our publishing work to Battle Creek, you were on the wrong track. But the Lord has taken this matter in hand in a way that must be recognized, and it is not necessary for me to carry this burden on my heart.",
