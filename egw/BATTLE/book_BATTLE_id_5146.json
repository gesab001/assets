    "word": "I have been given no encouragement to go to Battle Creek. I was shown that efforts would be made to call our leading men to Battle Creek to investigate the Scriptures and discuss points of difference. I was then instructed that the students who had been called to Battle Creek, and the ministers held there, are in a dangerous atmosphere. The proposition to continue the same relations to Battle Creek, which again and again have been pointed out as detrimental, and the proposal to do that which should not be done are ill timed and dangerous. The result of these relations is unbelief in the movings of the providence of God. The testimonies that the Lord has given to establish the faith of His people in His Word have been made of no effect.",
