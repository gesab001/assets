    "word": "Have you determined to be rich? Then let these words recorded in the sixth chapter of Matthew impress your heart and direct your life. They will teach you to be content, and to yield your will to the control of the Holy Spirit. You will not then be elbowing your fellow-workers that you may make room for your plans. But your greatest desire will be to work in just the place that God assigned you, and where He can look upon you with approval. Shall we not come into right relation to God? Shall we not put away all strife, which is a manifestation of unconverted self? When you feel sore because you think that somebody else is getting ahead of you, take the matter to the Father in prayer. Ask Him to put the impress of His Spirit upon your mind and character. When you feel like complaining at your lot, look about you for some soul who does not have all the blessings that you enjoy. Speak to him words of hope and comfort and encouragement. Such ministry will be a blessing to him, and a greater blessing to yourself. We need to reach the place where as a people we shall reveal in word and work that the Spirit of God is dwelling within; that we are over-comers by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. It is our privilege to make the battle of life easier for those with whom we associate. Shall we not endeavor to do this? If we will partake of Christ's labors for the uplifting and redemption of souls, we shall hear His words of benediction, \"Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"",
