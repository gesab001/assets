    "word": "MR No. 511 - Battle Creek Sanitarium\n\n     It is time for us to think soberly. . . . We should read the providence of God in His movements. Was the Battle Creek Sanitarium consumed by fire in order that the plans might be enlarged, greater buildings erected, and more display made? . . . My brethren, let your building plans be reconsidered. --Letter 128, 1902, pp. 2, 7. (To the General Conference Committee and Medical Missionary Board, July 6, 1902.) \n\nReleased September 26, 1977.",
