    "word": "The active agencies in connection with the work at \n\n154 \n\nBattle Creek have placed a wrong mold upon the work. Men have devised and planned in a manner that is not after the order of God, and the publishing house in California has altogether too largely followed and adopted the methods and inventions proceeding from Battle Creek. Strength and power will be in our institutions if they keep close to the word of God in all their connection and dealing with their fellow men.--Lt 80a, 1896.",
