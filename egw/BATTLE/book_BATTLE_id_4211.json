    "word": "Tell our brethren who have not sacrificed their faith that God has a people even in Battle Creek. The Lord has warned His people against gathering into Battle Creek, because there they would hear that which would confuse their faith and mislead their judgment.

Who can foresee today the things that unthinking, unconsecrated men will do, and the risks they will run because they neglect to make the religion of Christ their guide?",
