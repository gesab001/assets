Olsen, \n     Battle Creek, \n           Michigan. \n\nDear Bro.:-- \n     We feel deeply in regard to your case. We know that you have been placed in a very trying position; but we know also that you have signally failed in some things. You have, my brother, said much about the importance of prayer, and have felt desirous that our people should observe the customary week of prayer; this is well, we should have seasons of earnest, persevering prayer; for God is the strength of his people, their front guard and their rearward. But it is possible to make these seasons of prayer a substitute for the decided action that is necessary to set things in order. There is a class of work which it is the duty of the human agent to do in the name of the Lord God of Israel.",
