    "word": "The Lord is coming. \"Let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.\" \"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day.\" \"Yourselves know perfectly [should you arouse from your spiritual stupor] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.\" (1 Thessalonians 5:6, 5, 2.) Oh, that the church in Battle Creek would know that the day of the Lord is right upon them! He will come in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. Will any of us wish to be sleeping when the Lord comes?",
