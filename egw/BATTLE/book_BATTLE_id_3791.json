    "word": "There were thrusts in your pamphlet which the Lord did not prompt you to make. You have no right to wound the feelings of your brethren. You speak of them in a manner which I cannot sanction, because I have been shown many times in the case of others that it was not right. You call Brethren Jones and Waggoner fledglings, and you make reference to the words I spoke at the conference in California. I am surprised, my brother, to read such things from your pen. I was not making thrusts at you, Elder Butler; I was speaking upon general principles, and I felt that the cause before us required me to speak. I have been shown, in reference to Dr. Kellogg and his work, that which warranted me in speaking. I had been shown more than once that he was regarded in a wrong light by many in Battle Creek, that they were unchristian in their feelings and treatment of him, and that he was even regarded by some as a dishonest man.",
