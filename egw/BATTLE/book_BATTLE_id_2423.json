    "word": "Christians are to be light bearers in the world, shining amid the darkness of sin and crime. In the kingdom of this world, the principalities and powers that take Satan as their leader must constantly be met. Following Christ's example of cross bearing and self-denial makes those who receive Christ children of God. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1:12). They are victors in the battle of life; for they have put on the new man, \"which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him\" (Colossians 3:10).--Manuscript 30, March 2, 1902, \"Christlikeness in Business Dealings.\"",
