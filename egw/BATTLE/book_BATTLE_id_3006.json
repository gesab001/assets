The people did not retain in their memory his works of greatness and power or his words of warning. Had they remembered his wondrous dealings with them, they would not have received the reproof, \"And forgettest the Lord thy Maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?\" But the children of Israel forgot God, whose they were by creation and by redemption. After seeing all his wonderful works, they tempted him.",
