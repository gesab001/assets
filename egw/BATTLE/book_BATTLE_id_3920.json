    "word": "MR No. 1161 - Should Our Youth Go To Battle Creek?\n\n[BATTLE CREEK COLLEGE WAS MOVED TO BERRIEN SPRINGS, MICHIGAN, IN THE SUMMER OF 1901. HOWEVER, IN 1903, DR. JOHN HARVEY KELLOGG REOPENED BATTLE CREEK COLLEGE IN THE CITY OF BATTLE CREEK. HIS INTENTION WAS THAT THE SCHOOL SHOULD CONTINUE TO SERVE AS A FEEDER INSTITUTION FOR HIS MEDICAL SCHOOL, THE AMERICAN MEDICAL MISSIONARY COLLEGE. ELLEN WHITE STRONGLY OPPOSED DR. KELLOGG IN THIS ACTION AND URGED OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NO LONGER TO LOOK TO BATTLE CREEK FOR THEIR COLLEGE OR MEDICAL EDUCATION.]\n\n     [Written October 28, 1905, from St. Helena, California.] \n\n     As God's messenger I am to say to our people that we are not to encourage our youth to go to Battle Creek to receive an education. Fathers, mothers, the souls of your children are precious, and the warnings God has given that young men and young women should not be drawn to Battle Creek have now twice as much force as they had in the past.",
