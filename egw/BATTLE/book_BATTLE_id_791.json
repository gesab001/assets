    "word": "Through all of our trials we have a never-failing Helper. He does not leave us alone to struggle with temptation, to battle with evil, and be finally crushed with burdens and sorrow. Though now He is hidden from mortal sight, the ear of faith can hear His voice saying, \"Fear not; I am with you.\" \"I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore\" (Revelation 1:18) (The Desire of Ages, pp. 480-483). \n                                                                           205",
