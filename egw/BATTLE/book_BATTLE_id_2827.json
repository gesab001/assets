    "word": "\"May the Lord help us to move understandingly and prayerfully. I am sure that he is willing that we should know, and that right early, where we should locate our publishing house. I am satisfied that our only safe course is to be ready to move just when the cloud moves. Let us pray that he will direct us. He has signified, by his providence, that he would have us leave Battle Creek. In the large Tabernacle there, many meetings, many ministerial institutes have been held. Light and power have been centered there when they should have been scattered far and near, in the many cities yet unworked. Small centers should have been made in many places, to represent the truth. Thus much good would have been accomplished. New members would have been added to the ranks of believers. With an increase of numbers would have come an increase of tithe, providing means to carry the message to other places.",
