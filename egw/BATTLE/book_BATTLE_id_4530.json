July 15, 1889 \n\nDear daughter Mary: \n     I have just read your letter sent to Willie and I would say in regard to a horse or carriage, follow your best judgment. I sent you as a present the $100.00 for you to use as you need in anything either a horse or carriage. Just make it as pleasant for you as possible.",
