    "word": "I have been instructed that unless there is a decided changed in the religious experience of those who have refused to heed \n\n\n                               -465- \n\nthe warnings given them, but who, instead, remain willingly under the molding influence which now predominates at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, it will not be of the least use to explain everything that is presented as an objection to the visions. Some have been under his influence for years, and the many subterfuges and explanations that are resorted to there, will be taken up by those misled souls and used against the testimonies. So long as they refuse to heed the warnings given them, the spell that is upon them can not be broken. God has a work that must be carried forward purely and intelligently, in his own way, entirely separated from the influence of seducing spirits that some have communion with.",
