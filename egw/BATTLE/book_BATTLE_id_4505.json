    "word": "[Battle Creek,] Sabbath, March 9, 1889 \n     Elder A. T. Jones occupied the forenoon, speaking from the fifth commandment. The Lord gave him freedom in addressing the people. In the afternoon I spoke to the people from Hebrews 2. I felt a solemn burden upon me for the church and urged upon them the necessity of taking up their neglected duties in their families. Home religion is needed. The congregation were somewhat stirred. \n                                                                           272",
