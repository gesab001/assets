    "word": "But Bro. Waggoner is weak in many things. If God required him to expose and condemn a neighbor, to reprove and correct a brother, and resist and destroy his enemies, this would be to him a comparatively natural and easy work. But a warfare against self, subduing the desires and the affections of his own heart, searching out and controlling the secret motives of the heart, is a more difficult warfare. How unwilling to be faithful in such a contest as this. \n                                                                           133\nThe warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought. The yielding of self, surrendering all to the will of God, and being clothed with humility, possessing that love that is pure, peaceable, and easy to be entreated, full of gentleness and good fruits, is not an easy attainment. And yet it is his privilege and his duty to be a perfect overcomer here. The soul must submit to God before it can be renewed in knowledge and true holiness. The holy life and character of Christ is a faithful example. His confidence in his Heavenly Father was unlimited. His obedience and submission were unreserved and perfect. He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister to others. He came not to do his own will, but the will of Him that sent him. In all things he submitted himself to Him that judgeth righteously; and from the lips of the Saviour of the world was heard these words, \"I can of my own self do nothing.\"",
