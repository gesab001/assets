    "word": "I am speaking to the colored students here today because I want to encourage them. They have a battle to fight; they have a strong prejudice to work against. If they will do this righteously and patiently, not cherishing the feeling that they are misused, God will greatly bless them. Students, remember that Christ loves you; that God so loves you that He gave His only begotten Son to die for you, that you might be brought into the faith.",
