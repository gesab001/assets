    "word": "Ellen White Impressed to Delay Sending to J. H. Kellogg Messages Received in Europe--At times I have felt that I must print all the warnings given me for Dr. [J. H.] Kellogg, especially some that were given me while in Europe. But I have not yet done this, because I have been impressed to wait. If I should make a strong move in this direction, the battle would be on. Those who are opposing the light God has given would feel that they had been attacked, and would claim that they were compelled to make moves that otherwise they would not have made. And it would take much of our time to meet the issue.",
