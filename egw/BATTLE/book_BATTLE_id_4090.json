    "word": "I feel very sad over the condition of things in Battle Creek, but, Brother Butler, the only thing we can do is to keep as quiet as possible. We shall be misjudged and falsified, but we must stand as firm as a rock for the truth. We are not to be at the beck and call of those who try to draw us away from the work that God has given us. Satan has come down with great power, to work through men who, though they have been given a knowledge of the truth, have not kept the faith once delivered to the saints, and have become active agencies in impeding the progress of God's cause.",
