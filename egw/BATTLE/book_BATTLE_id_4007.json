    "word": "God is true. God is trustworthy. He speaks to men, and moves upon human hearts. The very words you would cut out of their articles are, it may be, the very words God has said should be written. God has been imparting light to His people in large measure; and He has not set up an acquisition at Battle Creek to decide questions which should be taken to Him. He does not design that those to whom He has given His Holy Spirit shall be worked by men who need a much larger measure of the grace of God before they can decide what is truth and what is error.",
