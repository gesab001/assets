    "word": "\"It is not surprising that a man who has passed through the experience that Elder Jones passed through in Battle Creek should sometimes err, He has had to arm himself, and keep on the armor constantly, fighting the various evils that were continually creeping in. He has kept himself braced for so long that he must now make an effort to unlearn many things. He must be reconverted. In his manner of presenting the principles of truth he must reform. God has great love for Brother Jones as well as for every other mortal who in some respects fails of reaching the standard placed before him.",
