    "word": "Read Some to Children \n     [Walling's Mills, Colorado] Saturday, October 18, 1873. It is a rather cold and windy day. The wind increases, making it very unpleasant. I arose with the headache. We walked out and prayed in the grove. I wrote an important matter for Pilot Grove church. My husband wrote to Battle Creek for paper. I read some to the children. It is rather difficult for them to keep quiet. We had a very precious season of prayer at the close of the Sabbath.--Ms 12, 1873, pp. 7, 8. (Diary, October 1 to 26, 1873.)",
