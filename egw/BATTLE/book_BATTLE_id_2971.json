    "word": "While you have been gratifying your inclination in the appropriation of money--God's money--for which you must give an account, missionary work has been hindered, and bound about for want of money and workers to lift the banner of truth in localities where they have never even heard the message of warning.

Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.\" What kind of witness for the truth are you in Battle Creek bearing to the unbelieving world? I have been shown that the Lord does not look upon your course with favor, for your practice contradicts your profession of faith. You are not doers of the words of Christ.",
