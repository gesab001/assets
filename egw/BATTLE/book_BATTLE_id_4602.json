Washburn\n\n                                                    W - 36a - 1890 \n\n                               Battle Creek, Mich., Sept. 18, 1890 \n\nDear Brother Washburn,-- \n     I received your letter this morning, and will reply at once. The article in the paper was in answer to your letter. I wrote it as a private letter long before it appeared in the Review; but as I read it to a few of our brethren, they urged me to put it in the paper, that others might be benefited by it, and I consented. The delay I could not interpret, but think by mistake my workers did not get the correct idea that there was to be no delay in the printing of the matter.",
