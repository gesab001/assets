We had a good meeting. We have felt like urging the brethren and sisters to take hold more earnestly in the cause of God and make earnest and persevering efforts to obtain the blessing of God. I would be glad to see you. I hear nothing from you except a few lines on postal cards. I try to send off a letter each day. I hope you receive them all.",
