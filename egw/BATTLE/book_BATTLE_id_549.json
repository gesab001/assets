    "word": "The derisive jests have ceased. Lying lips are hushed into silence. The clash of arms, the tumult of battle, \u201cwith confused noise, and garments rolled in blood,\u201d [Isaiah 9:5.] is stilled. Naught now is heard but the voice of prayer and the sound of weeping and lamentation. The cry bursts forth from lips so lately scoffing, \u201cThe great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?\u201d The wicked pray to be buried beneath the rocks of the mountains, rather than meet the face of Him whom they have despised and rejected.",
