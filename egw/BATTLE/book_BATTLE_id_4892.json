    "word": "Had the Sanitarium been re-established in accordance with the Lord's design, it would not now be in Battle Creek. The Lord permitted the Sanitarium to be destroyed by fire, to take away the objection raised to moving out of Battle Creek. It was His design, not that one large building should be erected, but that plans should be made in several places. These smaller sanitariums were to be established where they could have the benefit and advantage of land for agriculture purposes. It is God's plan that agriculture shall be carried on in connection with our sanitariums and schools. Our youth need the education to be gained from this line of work. It is well and more than well--it is essential--that efforts be made to carry out the Lord's plan in this respect.",
