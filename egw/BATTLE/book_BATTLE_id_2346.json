    "word": "After the ascension of Christ, the Holy Spirit did not immediately descend. There were ten days after His ascension before the Holy Spirit was given. This time was devoted by the disciples to most earnest preparation for receiving so precious an endowment. The rich treasures of heaven were poured out to them after they had searched their own hearts diligently and had sacrificed every idol. They were before God, humbling their souls, strengthening their faith, confessing their sins. And their hearts were in harmony with one another. \"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting\" (Acts 2:1, 2). The church needs a similar experience right here at the great heart of the work. [BATTLE CREEK, MICHIGAN, DENOMINATIONAL HEADQUARTERS FROM 1855 TO 1903.] Are we searching our hearts, preparing for the heavenly grace to be received? The Lord is waiting to be gracious.",
