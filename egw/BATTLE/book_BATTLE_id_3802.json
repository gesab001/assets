    "word": "MR No. 1012 - Qualifications of Parents and Teachers; a Call to Leave Battle Creek\n\n     You inquire, What shall we do with the school building? Shall we sell it to the Sanitarium? Shall we establish schools in different localities? To the latter question, I answer, Yes; establish schools. Let the very best talent that can be secured be selected for those schools. No cheap cast of mind should be placed in our church schools. The very best is required for educating and molding the human mind.",
