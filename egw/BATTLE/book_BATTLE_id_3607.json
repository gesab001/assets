    "word": "E. G. White's Confidence in the Divine Source of Her Revelations.--What a battle I am obliged to fight! My brethren seem to judge me as taking positions that are not necessary. They do not see that God in His own wisdom has made revelations to me which cannot successfully be contradicted or disputed. Nothing can rub out that which has been presented to me and imprinted on the tablets of my soul. All the oppositions or gainsaying to make my testimony of none effect only compels from me, by the urgency of the Spirit of God, a more decided repetition, and to stand on the light revealed with all the force of the strength God has given me.-- Manuscript 25, 1890, p. 1. (Untitled Manuscript, January 7, 1890.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. April 18, 1979",
