    "word": "During the past night matters have been presented to me which I dare not withhold. I seemed to be in a meeting at Battle Creek, where many were assembled. Persons from far and near were present. But in the meeting there was revealed a lack of unity. I saw marked evidence that our ministering brethren did not have the love and confidence they should have, and they were weak in consequence. Then one rose in the meeting, and with solemn, earnest words addressed the congregation. The words spoken impressed my mind vividly. The prayer of Christ for His disciples was repeated in a solemn, reverential manner, giving to it a sacred importance that I had never realized before. Then followed words of a similar character.--Ms 64, 1894, p. 1. (Untitled, October 27, 1894.)",
