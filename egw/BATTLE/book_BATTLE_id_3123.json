    "word": "There is a large church in Battle Creek, and not a man to act as pastor. There are elders; but these men lack the essential qualities to stand at their post of duty and hold the fort. Unless there is a different influence from what these men have exerted in the church, it will never be in a prosperous condition. These men lead the church into the world rather than from it. Men are needed who will be steadfast to principle, who will not only lift, but carry the burden, through Christ strengthening them,-- men whom ambition will not mislead, or peril intimidate.",
