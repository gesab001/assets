    "word": "I am now instructed to place before our people the warnings given in regard to the medical missionary work--that this work was not to be a separate work, but was ever to be the helping hand of the gospel. The enemy influenced men to devise special documents to be signed. This was a snare to those who signed, to the institutions connected with the Battle Creek Sanitarium, and to yourself. You were acting in the capacity of one of authority and of chief influence, having oversight of these institutions. There was no need for the warnings on this point to be given more than once, but they had to be repeated over and over again. The light given, unheeded, had to be repeated, more and still more forcibly, that it might be shown that these methods and plans were not after the Lord's order.",
