The condition of things in Battle Creek is to be clearly outlined and understood. Those who have brought about this condition are sadly deceived, and are misleading others. But the Lord will be glorified. Great spiritual transformations are to take place. All those who would be led of God, should walk very humbly before Him. In no case are they to be diverted from the path of duty that God has marked out for His people. They are not to believe falsehoods, though they be published in abundance.",
