    "word": "This burden has been upon me for years. A course is pursued at Battle Creek such as the Lord does not approve. The end of all things is at hand. The day of distress, of anguish, of plague, of retribution, of judgment for sin, is coming on the world as a thief in the night. The time is near when sudden destruction will come upon the world, and they will not escape. I have a word of warning for you. You are viewing things in altogether too feeble a light, and far too much from a merely human standpoint. A very small portion of God's great moral vineyard has yet been worked. Only a few, comparatively, have received the last message of mercy that is to be given to the world. Students are led to suppose that their efficiency depends upon their education and training; but the success of the work does not depend upon the amount of knowledge men have in scientific studies. The thought to be kept before students is that time is short, and that they must make speedy preparation for doing the work that is essential for this time. Every man, in and through the grace given him of God, is to do the work, not depending on his human earnestness or ability; for God can remove human ability in a moment. Let each one in the strength of the living Saviour, who today is our Advocate in the courts of heaven, strive to do the will of God.",
