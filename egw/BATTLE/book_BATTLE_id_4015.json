    "word": "I write to you now because I want you (and W. C. White is of the same mind) to visit us in Australia. We think Present Truth the best paper published by our people. We enjoyed Elder and Mrs. Prescott's visit here very much, and I was surprised that he did not remain in Battle Creek when he returned. It may be in the providence of God that he is where he is, but I do hope and pray that the Lord will adjust the work so that proper ones will take hold of it in Battle Creek.",
