    "word": "Willie, Sara, Maggie, [SARA MCENTERFER WAS ELLEN WHITE'S NURSE AND SECRETARY; MAGGIE HARE WAS ONE OF HER LITERARY ASSISTANTS.] and I have been in southern California for six weeks. From College View I returned to Battle Creek, in fulfillment of my promise. I remained there a week, and then started home. You will remember that while I was at College View I caught a severe cold. I did not get rid of this cold, and I was thoroughly exhausted when I reached home. We remained in St. Helena for three weeks, and during this time we buried Marian. [MARIAN DAVIS, ELLEN WHITE'S FAITHFUL \"BOOKMAKER.\"] I cannot tell you how keenly I felt, and continue to feel the loss of my faithful helper, whom I so highly prized.",
