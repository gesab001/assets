    "word": "THIS SECTION CLOSES WITH THE PRESENTATION OF EXPERIENCES IN AUDIENCE RESPONSE IN A NUMBER OF REVIVALS IN WHICH ELLEN WHITE HERSELF PARTICIPATED. THESE HELP TO SHOW HOW SHE CARRIED INTO HER WORK THE INSTRUCTION CONCERNING SOUL WINNING THAT DISTINGUISHED HER COUNSELS TO GOSPEL WORKERS. MANY OF THESE EXPERIENCES RECORDED BY MRS. WHITE MAINLY IN HER DAILY JOURNAL APPEAR IN TERSE, DIARY STYLE. THE WORD PICTURES SHE PAINTS OF MAKING APPEALS FOR PUBLIC RESPONSE BEGIN WITH THE EARLY YEARS IN BATTLE CREEK AND CARRY OVER INTO EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA, THEN BACK AGAIN TO THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REPETITION IN THE ACCOUNTS, BUT ENOUGH OF SINGULAR INTEREST IN EACH ITEM TO PROVE OF VALUE TO THE READER.--WHITE TRUSTEES",
