    "word": "God is in his holy place, and he dwells also with him who is of a humble and contrite spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. Those who are doing medical missionary work should have the full sanction and cooperation of the church. If they do not have this, they are hindered. Nevertheless, they will advance.

If the medical missionary workers will carry this line of effort into the churches everywhere, if they will work in the fear of God, they will find many doors opened before them, and angels will work with them. \n\n\n                     -5-",
