    "word": "I am troubled in regard to the publishing work. I ask if the same men, Brethren Evans and Rhodes, who have occupied responsible positions in the office of publication at Battle Creek, are to be leaders in the publishing work in Washington. In the past, Brother Sisley, with his strong spirit, too often stood on the negative side. He has done many strange things, and his course has been an education to others in the office who were carrying responsibilities. Had he been thoroughly under the guidance of the Lord, he might have exerted an influence that would have molded and fashioned others in accordance with the pure principles of Bible truth. But for many years he refused to yield himself to the will and way of God. The precious grace of Jesus Christ was not revealed through him.",
