    "word": "Byron Sperry is being corrupted by associating with those boys who have not the right influence. The Hayward boy and George Warren are not profitable associates for Byron. Byron is easily influenced in the wrong direction. Battle Creek is not the best place for him. Byron's habits are not pure; self-abuse is practiced by him, and this crime, indulged by him, and loving the company of evil associates, will weaken his desires which help to form a correct and virtuous character, and secure Heaven at last. The youth, who desire immortality, must stop \n                                                                           28\nwhere they are, and not allow an impure thought or an impure act. Impure thoughts lead to impure actions. If Christ is the theme of contemplation the thoughts will be widely separated from every subject which will lead to impure acts. The mind will strengthen by exercise in dwelling upon elevating subjects. It will become healthy and vigorous if trained to run in the channel of purity and holiness. The mind, if trained to dwell upon spiritual themes, will, by cultivation, naturally take that turn. But this attraction of the thoughts to heavenly things cannot be without the exercise of faith in God, and an earnest, humble reliance upon him for strength, and that grace which is sufficient for every emergency.",
