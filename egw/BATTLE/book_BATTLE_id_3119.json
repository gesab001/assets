    "word": "My heart aches day after day and night after night for the church in Battle Creek. They are progressing, but in the back track. \"The path of the just shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\" Their march is onward and upward. They progress from strength to strength, from grace to grace, and from glory to glory. This is the privilege of the church in Battle Creek. But oh, how different has it been! You need divine illumination. You must face square about. I know what I say. Unless you shall become Christians indeed, you will go from weakness to weakness, divisions will increase, and many souls will be led to perdition.",
