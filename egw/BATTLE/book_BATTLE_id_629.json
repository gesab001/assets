    "word": "We have a part to act in this work. Let none think that men and women are going to be taken to heaven without engaging in the struggle here below. We have a battle to fight, a victory to gain. God says to us, \"Work out your own salvation.\" How? \"With fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\" (Philippians 2:12, 13). God works, and man works.... Thus only can we be partakers of the divine nature.",
