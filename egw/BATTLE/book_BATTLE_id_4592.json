Olsen\n\n                                                             O-115-1890 \n\n                                                  Battle Creek, Michigan \n                                                  June 21, 1890 \n\nDear Brother Olsen: \n     I just returned from an eight-mile ride in the country. Your letter was found on my table. Thank you for writing to me. We answered the telegram from Nashua that Willie's wife sleeps, that the funeral will be next Tuesday. But it cannot be before Wednesday. They leave Boulder today, June 21, and cannot get there before Tuesday. You see at once that I could not leave at this time. After the funeral it is possible for me to go Thursday and be with you over Sabbath and Sunday. But I would have to have an attendant, and would it not be a needless expense?",
