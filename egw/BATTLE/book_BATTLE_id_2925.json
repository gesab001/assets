If mistakes have been made, learn about them, not from a desire to crush the one who has made them, but from a desire to help, that no one be separated from God's work. Help those who have erred, by telling them of your experiences, showing how, when you made grave mistakes, patience and fellowship, kindness and helpfulness, on the part of your fellow-workers, gave you courage and hope. Harsh judgment is not becoming. Be afraid to condemn where God has not condemned. Remember that your brethren love God, and that they are striving to keep His commandments as verily as you are. You have been in the battle, and you carry the scars of conflict. Will you not deal mercifully with those who are fiercely assailed? \n\n                                               -",
