    "word": "MR No. 1406 - Counsel on the Importance of Making Every Aspect of the Sabbath School, Including Enactments, Count for Eternity\n\n     (Written December 26, 1888, from Battle Creek, Michigan, to \"Dear Brother Morse.\" ) \n\n\n     I have risen at three o'clock this morning to write you a few lines. [THIS LETTER REFERS TO A DRAMATIZED CHRISTMAS PROGRAM PUT ON BY THE BATTLE CREEK SABBATH SCHOOL. THE CHILDREN WORE COSTUMES. ELLA WHITE, MRS. WHITE'S SIX-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER, WAS IN THE PROGRAM, DRESSED TO REPRESENT AN ANGEL.] I was pleased with the lighthouse, and the scene which had required so much painstaking effort was one which could have been made most impressive, but [it] failed to be made as forcible and striking as it might have been when it cost so much time and labor in preparing it. The part acted by the children was good. The reading was appropriate. Then if there had been good solid talk on that occasion in regard to children and teachers in the Sabbath schools laboring earnestly for the salvation of the souls of the children under your charge, presenting the most acceptable offering to Jesus, the gift of their own hearts, and impressive remarks, short and right to the point, [on] how they could do this, would it not have been in keeping with the work we have been trying to do in the church?",
