    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., Feb. 21, 1890. \n     Brethren Church and Bell, and All the Church in Fresno: I hope you will not be so greatly misled as to consider E. P. Daniels a suitable man to be trusted to preach the word of God to the church in Fresno, until he is a thoroughly converted man; and I have some little hope that he will be. You will have the privilege of reading the testimonies that have been sent to him during past years. His course of action shows what influence these testimonies have had upon him. I have no confidence that the man is under the direction of the Spirit of God. I have felt it duty, as one upon whom the Lord has laid special burdens, to lay open before the churches the warnings and counsels given me of God; and if, after knowing them, you are so unwise as to accept E. P. Daniels as your minister, may the Lord pity you and the poor church. I dare not hold my peace. Better never have a sermon preached in your church than to have it from the lips of a man through whom the Lord cannot speak.",
