    "word": "In the most trying times they took their stand firmly determined to breast every difficulty, and to free Battle Creek College from debt; also, if it were possible, to move the school from Battle Creek.

Just before the General Conference, there seemed to be a favorable opportunity to sell the school buildings. But the word of the Lord came to me for the brethren. \"You are in too great a hurry. Follow on as God shall open the way. He will guide you. Work up the Sale of Christ's Object Lessons. Interest the people in the work that you are trying to do. You will find that believers and unbelievers will help you.\"",
