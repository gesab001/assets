    "word": "Tuesday, March 4, 1873--We are still blessed with beautiful weather. My rest was not as good last night. We have a beautiful car, heated with steam pipes. We have lived out of our basket the entire journey with the exception of expending thirty-five cents for sundries. We are losing our appetites. Our friends go out to meals. They frequently expend one dollar each for a hasty meal, and lie down at night restless and cannot sleep because of eating so heartily. We have rested well nearly every night. We took our last meal at one o'clock p.m. Changed cars at Chicago. Arrived at Battle Creek at half past ten p.m. Brother Abbey was waiting with sleigh for us. We came to our own home. Got to rest at (?) o'clock a.m.--Ms. 5, 1873, pp. 1-2. (Diary, March 1-4, 1873.)",
