    "word": "God has given us all something to do; and in the discharge of various duties, our lives will be made useful, and we shall be blessed. \u201cNot slothful in business,\u201d [Romans 12:11.] is the injunction of the apostle Paul. A person might as well expect a harvest where he has not sown, as to expect \n97\nto be saved while living in indolence. The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, yet \u201che shall become poor that dealeth with a slack hand.\u201d [Proverbs 10:4.] Those who are diligent in business may not always be prospered; but drowsiness and idleness are sure to grieve the Spirit of God, and destroy true godliness. A stagnant pool becomes offensive; but a pure, flowing brook spreads health and gladness over the land.",
