    "word": "Grace sufficient, if accepted and improved, is given for the duties and trials of each day. But in order to learn how to do those things that please God, we are to remain as students in the school of Christ. We are not in the world to amuse and please ourselves. We are making history. The church is making history. Every day is a battle and a march. On every side we are beset by invisible foes, and we either conquer through the grace given us by God, or we are conquered.",
