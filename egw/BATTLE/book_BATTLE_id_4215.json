    "word": "In regard to Dr. Kellogg's books, and the position that they should occupy in the field, deserves careful thought. While on the cars coming from Battle Creek to this place, I have been calling up the things which the Lord has been pleased to present \n\n\n                                     -433- \n\nbefore me upon the subject of health reform. I have in the fear of the Lord presented this matter before the people as the Lord has presented it to me for years in the past. I have seen our people standing in a much better position on this question than at the present time. I am sure upon one point: that Brother Butler's position in regard to this question--his ideas and his work in reference to it--is not in harmony with the light given me of God. Years ago I had a testimony of reproof for the managers in our camp meetings bringing upon the ground and selling to our people cheese and other hurtful things, and presenting candies for sale when I was laboring to instruct the young and old to put the money they had expended for candy in the missionary box and thus teach their children self-denial.",
