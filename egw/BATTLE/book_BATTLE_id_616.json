    "word": "\u201cAt this point the grandeur of the valley Lucerna attains its height.\u201d \u201cImmediately behind Bobbio shoots up the \u2018Barion,\u2019 symmetrical as an Egyptian obelisk, but far taller and more massive. Its summit rises three thousand feet above the roofs of the little town. Compared with this majestic monolith, the proudest monument of Europe's proudest capital is a mere toy. Yet even the \u2018Barion\u2019 is but one item in this assemblage of glories. Overtopping it behind, and sweeping round the extremity of the valley, is a glorious amphitheater of crags and precipices, inclosed by a background of great mountains, some rounded like domes, others sharp as needles.\u201d \u201cIn this unrivaled amphitheater sits Bobbio, in summer buried in blossoms and fruit, and in winter wrapped in the shadows of its great mountains, and the mist of their tempests.\u201d \u201cA carpet of rich meadows clothes the valley from side to side; fruit-trees fleck it with their shadows; the Pellice waters it; and on either hand is a wall of mountains.\u201d \u201cOver these are hung stupendous battlements of rocks; and above all, towering high in the air, are the everlasting peaks in their robes of ice and snow.\u201d",
