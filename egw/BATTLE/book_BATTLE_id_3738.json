    "word": "J. H. Kellogg Warned He Is In Danger--Brother John Kellogg, my mother-heart goes out toward you with weeping, for by symbols I am warned that you are in danger. Satan is making masterly efforts to cause your feet to slide, but God's eye is upon you. Fight these last battles manfully. Stand equipped with the whole armor of righteousness. By faith I lay you in earnest prayer at the feet of Jesus. You are safe only in that position. Never for a moment suppose that you are in no danger.--Letter 132, 1898, pp. 4,5. (To J. H. Kellogg, Dec. 29, 1898.)",
