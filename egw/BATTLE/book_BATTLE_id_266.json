    "word": "How many who know the truth for this time are working in harmony with its principles? It is true that something is being done; but more, far more, should have been done. The work is accumulating, and the time for doing it is diminishing. All should now be burning and shining lights, and yet many are failing to keep their lamps supplied with the oil of grace, trimmed and burning, \n                                                                           419\nso that light may gleam out today. Too many are counting on a long stretch of tomorrow, but this is a mistake. Let everyone be educated in such a way as to show the importance of the special work for today. Let everyone labor for God and for souls; let each show wisdom and never be found in idleness, waiting for someone to set him to work. The \"someone\" who could set you to work is overcrowded with responsibilities, and time is lost in waiting for his directions. God will give you wisdom in reforming at once; for the call is still made, \"Son, go work today in My vineyard.\" \"Today if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.\" Hebrews 3:7, 8. The Lord prefaces the requirement with the endearing word \"son.\" How tender, how compassionate, yet withal, how urgent! His invitation is also a command.--Special Testimonies on Education, pages 108-146; written March 21, 1895, to the teachers in the Sanitarium and College at Battle Creek, Michigan. \n\n                                               -",
