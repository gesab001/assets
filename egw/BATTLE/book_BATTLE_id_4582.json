Colcord (incomplete)\n\n                                                      C-60-1890 \n                                               Battle Creek, Michigan \n                                               March 10, 1890 \n\nDear Brother Colcord: \n     I have been so very much pressed with labor, speaking and writing, that I have had no time to write. Your question I will answer as best I can. I take no credit of ability in myself to write the articles in the paper or to write the books which I publish. Certainly I could not originate them. I have been receiving light for the last forty-five years and I have been communicating the light given me of Heaven to our people as well as to all whom I could reach. I am seeking to do the will of my heavenly Father.",
