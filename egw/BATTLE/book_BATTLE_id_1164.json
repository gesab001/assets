    "word": "Pacific Press Branches Allowed to Live.--The Lord presented before me that branches of this work would be planted in other places, and carried on under the supervision of the Pacific Press, [AT THE PRESENT TIME BRANCH OFFICES OF THE PACIFIC PRESS ARE OPERATING IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA; OSHAWA, ONTARIO; AND MONTEMORELOS, MEXICO.] but that if this proved a success, jealousy, evil surmisings, and covetousness would arise. Efforts would be made to change the order of things, and embrace the work among other interests at Battle Creek. Men are very zealous to change the order of things, but the Lord forbids such a consolidation. Every branch should be allowed to live, and do its own work.",
