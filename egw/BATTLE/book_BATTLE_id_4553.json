    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., October 31, 1889 \n\n     Thursday morning. Attended the early morning meeting and bore a straight testimony. Invited Brethren Nicola [?] and Morrison to see me. Had a long interview with Brother Strong, whose son was killed in the Review office in a shocking manner by being struck with the elevator. His head was smashed to pieces. His father feels this blow keenly. We need to encourage him all we can. Oh, that God may bless this to his good and he not make it an occasion to use to do him harm. \n                                                                           468",
