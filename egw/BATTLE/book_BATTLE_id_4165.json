Kellogg and His Book, The Living Temple\n\n     (Written August 1, 1904, from Takoma Park, Washington, D.C., to Brethren Paulson, Sadler, Jones, and Waggoner. Portions of this manuscript appear in Through Crisis to Victory, Selected Messages, book 2, and various Manuscript Releases.) \n\n\n     In the night season I seemed to be in a large company, speaking plainly and decidedly under the inspiration of the Spirit of God.
