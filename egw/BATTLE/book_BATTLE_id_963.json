    "word": "It had been made a law in Israel that before they went to battle the following proclamation should be made throughout the army: \u201cWhat man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.\u201d And the officers were to speak further to the people, saying, \u201cWhat man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren\u2019s heart faint as well as his heart\u201d (Deuteronomy 20:5-8).",
