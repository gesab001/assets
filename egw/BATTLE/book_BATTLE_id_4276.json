[THE FIRST FIVE OF THESE INSTANCES ARE QUOTED \n             IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION WITH THE 1890 DIARY ENTRIES.] \n             Battle Creek, Michigan, January 9, 1891 \n\n\n     I have been laboring two months and two-thirds of the third month, constantly, and although I commenced in much feebleness, and afflicted with infirmities, the Lord wrought in behalf of His people. We have seen the salvation of God. In this round of labor I spoke 55 times, and some of these meetings were occasions of most earnest labor, continuing from half-past two till five and six o'clock, but always successful. On one occasion I was much perplexed to know and to understand my duty. I had painful gatherings in my ear that with severe colds made it hard for me. At Salamanca, New York, I was severely afflicted and thought I must return home. I went to my chamber and bowed before God, and before I had even asked, the Lord heard, and revealed Himself; the room seemed to be full of the light and presence of God. I was lifted out of all my discouragements, and was made free and happy. I could not sleep but I praised God with heart and voice. This blessing was just what I needed. Courage and faith and hope were again in lively exercise, and I went on my way rejoicing.--Ms. 2, 1891, p. 1.",
