    "word": "The experience that we have passed through since the Conference of 1901 has been a complicated one, and thus our experience will continue to be. Just as long as the managers of the Sanitarium try to make Battle Creek a great center, so long will they call for men and women and ministers to do the work which they can not do. How can we encourage the plans to gather our youth into Battle Creek, when our heavenly Father has said that this place is not to be made a great center for educational work? Those educated there have not been receiving a training that will rightly prepare them to engage in the work of God. Seeds of doubt and of opposition to the Testimonies have been sown. Better far would it have been for the future of our work if those who have received their education in Battle Creek had been educated where the spiritual atmosphere is purer.--Letter written in 1904. \n                                                                           26",
