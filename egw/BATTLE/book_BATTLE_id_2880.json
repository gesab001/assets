    "word": "Cooranbong, N. S. W., Aug. 2, 1895. \n     . . . I beg of you and all the officials at the Pacific Press to know that every move you make is in the light of the counsel of God. The moves being made of consolidation mean placing all your powers under the jurisdiction of the powers in office at Battle Creek. I say, God forbid that you should adopt the plans and be controlled by the principles that have ruled them like the laws of the Medes and Persians.",
