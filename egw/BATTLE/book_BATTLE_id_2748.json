    "word": "PH013 - Appeal to the Young (1874)\n\n\n     Dear Youth: My mind has been burdened on your account for a few days. I find that I cannot get you off from my mind. The Lord has given me, from time to time, testimonies of warning for you. He has also given you encouragement if you would yield your hearts' best and holiest affections to God. As these warnings revive distinctly before me, I feel a sense of your danger that I know you do not feel. The school located in Battle Creek brings many young people together of different mental organizations. If these youth are not consecrated to God, and humbly walking in the way of his commandments, obedient to his will, the location of a school in Battle Creek will prove a means of great discouragement to the church.",
