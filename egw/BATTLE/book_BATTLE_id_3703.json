    "word": "Travel by Train From Denver to Battle Creek, 1873--(Denver, Colorado) Thursday, November 6, 1873: We are at Denver. We are preparing to leave on the train at six o'clock tonight. Mrs. Walling [Ellen White's niece] is in a very troubled state of mind. She has pursued her course of fretting and scolding her husband and children [Addie and May] until she has weaned his affections from her. He insists that the children shall go with us to California. The mother reluctantly consented. Little May had a little frettish turn, but I was firm and yet gentle with her before her father and mother, and it passed over very well. The mother feels bad. May God show her the error of her ways before it shall be too late. Mr. Walling attended us to the cars and parted with us and his children. The children are perfectly happy with us.",
