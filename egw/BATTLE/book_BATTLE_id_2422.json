    "word": "The Lord calls for reforms, marked, distinct reforms. Those in whose hearts Christ dwells will reveal His presence in their dealing with their fellow men. But the principles of some have been so long perverted that they have lost their discernment, and the arrow seldom reaches its mark. How can this be cured? Only by heeding Christ's prayer, \"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth\" (John 17:17-19). There is no roundabout way in which the work of sanctification can take place.--Manuscript 16, Feb. 25, 1901, \"Testimony to the Battle Creek Church.\"",
