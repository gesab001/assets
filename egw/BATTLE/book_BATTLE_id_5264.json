But few have understood how heavy has been the financial burdens and how great have been the perplexities brought to these brethren by the removal of the school from Battle Creek to Berrien Springs. Much was involved in the transfer, and in the constant effort made to build up an educational institution the work of which would be in accordance with the exalted principles underlying Christian education.",
