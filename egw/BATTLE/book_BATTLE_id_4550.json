    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., October 28, 1889 \n\n     Attended early morning meeting and engaged with our brethren in earnest prayer to God for His special blessing, which it is our privilege to have daily. I then spoke with great plainness in reference to some who were attending the meeting but had given no evidence they were partakers of the Spirit and power of God in the meeting. They did not seem to discern where God was at work. They seemed to be moving as if blindfolded. They were hearing the testimonies that God was giving to His people, but appeared as unconcerned and unmoved as the careless, impenitent sinners when the truth is brought before them. I called upon some who have been working contrary to God for one year in a marked manner, because special, marked light has been given them and it will be uncommon stubbornness and wilfulness to turn from this precious light God has given. The darkness of every individual will be in proportion to his unbelief and his resistance and contempt of the light which God graciously sends.",
