    "word": "There is very much [that] needs to be done here in Battle Creek. May the Lord guide, is my constant prayer. We do not want self to have anything to do in directing or managing. We want that the Lord should lead; then there will be no mistakes made. Poor mortals will err and make bad mistakes which will involve the ruin of souls, but if the dear Saviour leads, and we are constantly consulting His wishes and doing His bidding, we shall move surely and shall not be compelled to retrace our steps. Oh, that we could ever trust fully with unwavering faith in our dear Redeemer!",
