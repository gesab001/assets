Butler and wife\n\n                                                          B-18-1888 \n                                                          Battle Creek, Mich. \n                                                          December 11, 1888 \n\nDear Brother and Sister Butler:-- \n     I sincerely hope that you will not leave Battle Creek until after the Week of Prayer. Let us together seek the Lord, place ourselves in the channel of light, and open our hearts to the divine Spirit. I believe the Lord will work for us. I cannot bear the thought of your leaving Battle Creek just now, for your leaving will not tend to draw our hearts any nearer in harmony. The Lord is waiting to be gracious, and I am desirous that you shall see matters in a different light than you now see them. I am very desirous that you shall not leave Battle Creek. Be assured that I will do all in my power to have that unity which Christ prayed might exist with His disciples. If we are wrong we want to see the matter as it is, and make things straight. I beg of you not to listen to the tempter and leave this place until after the Week of Prayer. We want the favor of God. The Lord can do His work without us, but we cannot do His work without His divine presence.",
