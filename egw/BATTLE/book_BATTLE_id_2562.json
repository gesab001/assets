    "word": "The Work of the Holy Spirit. \n\n     The great object of the advent of the Holy Spirit is distinctly specified by Christ. \"When he is come,\" he said, \"he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.\" This light has been kept before our people for years. The power of the Holy Spirit has been largely manifested at Battle Creek, the great heart of the work, to be communicated to those in the highways and hedges, that the mass of human beings under Satan's sway of sin and death might be reformed and renovated by the Spirit's power. But when light has come to those at the center of the work, they have not known how to treat it. The testimonies God has given his people are in harmony with his word.",
