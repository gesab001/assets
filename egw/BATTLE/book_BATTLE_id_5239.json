    "word": "To Our Brethren in Council at Battle Creek. \n\n                                 St. Helena, Cal., April 17, 1903. \n\n\n     Some way must be devised in which our medical institutions shall be helped. According to the light given me, the Lord will institute ways and means by which the Battle Creek Sanitarium can be helped. When our watchmen shall recover from their blindness, and reason from cause to effect, God will help them to devise ways and means for the relief of our medical institutions.",
