But the same error has been committed in Africa that was committed in Battle Creek, \u2014 a centre was made in one place at a large outlay of means, while other portions of the Lord's vineyard which should have been worked were neglected. God will use in His work humble men who do not think themselves so useful that they trust to their own judgment and efficiency.",
