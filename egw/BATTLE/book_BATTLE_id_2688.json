    "word": "What a rebuke to a life of self-serving on the part of those who claim to be disciples of Christ! Are those who claim to be followers of Christ showing anxious care about the things of this life, are they giving first consideration to houses and lands, and business interests? Are they showing the greed, the selfishness, the sinfulness of sharp practises? In the past this was done in our institutions in Battle Creek, and it placed them where the rebuke of God fell on their unrighteousness. His judgments came upon the two largest of our institutions. Before all the world His displeasure was shown by stern judgments. And yet, there are those who, since these terrible experiences, have refused correction and have followed a course of determined obstinacy. Some seem determined to continue doing those things that brought the expression of the displeasure of God upon those who would not heed admonition and warnings. They have kept up a continual defiance against God, and warfare against the testimonies of reproof that He has sent.",
