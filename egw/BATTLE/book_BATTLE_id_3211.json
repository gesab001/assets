    "word": "There has been two spirits in the Office at Rochester, and two spirits in the Office at Battle Creek, and the Lord has shown that the spirit of reproof should never die out of the Office. It will live there just as long as the Office exists. If Uriah and James are connected in that Office, their interests are one, and the barrier that has been placed between them must be broken down, and they be in perfect union, having confidence in each other, or not labor in connection at all. I saw that you have cruelly wronged James without a cause. God has given him a position to occupy, and you have been at war with it. Two years ago was the reproof given for Uriah and yourself. Read it all over and see if it has been heeded. I saw that the Lord's providence has sustained James, but your feelings have been to tear him down. Harriet, may the Lord give you a full sense of the part you have been acting. Your selfish feelings would lead you to tear Uriah from the Office that you might enjoy his company more \n                                                                           22\nexclusively yourself, but it would be a fearful step for you both.",
