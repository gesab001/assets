    "word": "Elder and Mrs. Farnsworth have been requested to spend some time in Battle Creek laboring for the church. I encouraged them to do so, and shall counsel them how to labor. It will be well for Elder Farnsworth and Elder A. T. Jones to stand shoulder to shoulder, preaching the word in the Tabernacle for a time, and giving the trumpet a certain sound. There are in Battle Creek precious souls who need bracing up. Many will gladly hear and distinguish the note of warning. But Elder Farnsworth should not remain in Battle Creek long. I write these things to you because it is important that they should be understood.",
