    "word": "The infinite wisdom and power of God are exerted in our behalf. The heavenly host are surely fighting our battles for us. They are always looking with intense interest upon the souls purchased by the Saviour's blood. They see, through the sacrifice of Christ, the value of the human soul. It is always safe to be on the Lord's side, not halfheartedly, but wholly. It is this halfhearted, indifferent, careless work that separates your souls from Jesus, the source of your strength. Let this be your prayer: \"Take everything from me, let me lose property, worldly honor, everything, but let Thy presence be with me.\" It is safe to commit the keeping of the soul to God, who reigns over all heaven and earth.",
