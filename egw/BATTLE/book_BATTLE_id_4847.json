    "word": "Not one twentieth part of the home missionary work is being done in Battle Creek that should be done to set things in order in the large business establishment of the publishing house. A most thorough reformation is needed at the heart of the work, and yet there is such blindness, such blindness, that men have allowed things to drift as they have. Where are the men who have the fear of God before them, who love God, who love their fellow-men, who feel a tender regard for the youth, who can be trusted with the work? Where is the man who can act as President of the General Conference in its present tangled, confused, crippled condition? Any man, even though he did his very best, would now be criticized and regarded with suspicion, because the people have been educated to look to Battle Creek as the power of God, the sanctuary where dwells the presence of God. \n                                                                           1630",
