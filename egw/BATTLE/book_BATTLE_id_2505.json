    "word": "Home Missionary Work. \n\n     The home missionary spirit is little known among us, and its manifestation is greatly needed in every line of work. A portion of the church has begun to exhibit some activity along missionary lines. But if we do not awake more generally and fully, then those who know not the truth for this time, will advance before us, and block up our way. How long will it require to wake up the idlers who have for years loitered in Battle Creek? When will they become faithful witnesses for God? How long will it be before they yoke up with Christ? How much time each day is set apart for the worship of God? How many have seasons for contemplation and for fervent prayer? How many have \n\n\n                          - 39 - \n\neducated themselves in economical habits, so that they may have gifts and offerings for the Lord's house? How many have had their hearts warmed by the practical exercise of benevolence? How many have made earnest efforts to inspire others to work for the Master? To work at home successfully will need a spirit, faith, and perseverance that will not fail nor be discouraged. There is not one inactive in heaven, and no one will enter the mansions of bliss who has failed to show love for Christ, who has put forth no efforts for the salvation of others. Who can tell the work that might have been done in our churches, if those who had advocated the truth had not left these feeble churches, to crowd into Battle Creek? If all our people had been faithful, diligent, God-fearing servants of Christ, and had put forth efforts to make their influence as far-reaching as possible at home, where they were, how many souls might have been saved! One taper kindled in one place might have been the means of kindling many others, and the result would have been that the voice of praise and thanksgiving would have been heard, and many would have said, \"What hath God wrought! He hath done exceedingly abundantly above all that we asked or thought.\" \n\n                                               -",
