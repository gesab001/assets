    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., Tuesday, December 30, 1890 \n\n     We changed cars early in the morning. Waited forty minutes. Stepped into a restaurant across the street and called for warm drink - hot water and milk - and were refreshed. We were soon seated in the cars for Toledo. Without delay we took streetcars for the next depot while a dray took our trunks across. We found cars open and we took our seats in them. They did not leave for half an hour. I was thankful we performed the journey thus far so comfortably. We reached Battle Creek about three p.m.",
