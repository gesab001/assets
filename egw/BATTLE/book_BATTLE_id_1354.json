    "word": "Ellen White Counsels With Some of the Leaders.-- I had received a long epistle from Elder Butler, [THE PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE WAS DETAINED IN BATTLE CREEK BECAUSE OF ILLNESS.] which I read carefully. I was surprised at its contents. I did not know what to do with this letter, but as the same sentiments expressed in it seemed to be working and controlling my brother ministers I called a few of them together in an upper room and read this letter to them. They did not, any of them, seem to be surprised at its contents, several saying they knew this was the mind of Elder Butler, for they had heard him state the same things.",
