    "word": "Where Are We Drifting? \n\n     A sister who had spent some weeks at one of our institutions in Battle Creek said that she felt much disappointed in what she saw and heard there.

But she was surprised and pained at the lightness, the worldliness, and lack of devotion which she met on every hand.",
