    "word": "Prescott's Ideas of Education to Be Changed (To P. T. Magan and E. A. Sutherland)--You should endeavor to train the very best class of workers, who as teachers and as ministers of the gospel will be able to educate others. I think that if it is possible, you should have Elder Prescott connected with your faculty during the first term. This first term must be a success. [THE COLLEGE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM BATTLE CREEK TO BERRIEN SPRINGS, MICHIGAN, FIVE MONTHS EARLIER, IN JULY, 1901.] The Lord desires our Brother Prescott to learn many things in educational lines. His ideas of education are to be different from what they once were. And I thank the Lord that He has been giving him the light that is so much needed by the students who shall go forth as teachers.--Letter 161, 1901, p. 5 (Nov. 5, 1901). \n\n\n                                   -352-",
