    "word": "MR No. 342 - A. R. Henry and Lawsuits\n\n     While I respect . . . your capabilities as a businessman, which led me to urge your coming to the great heart of the work in Battle Creek, I still shall urge that you may in some respects greatly improve. I know that this coming was not your choice, yet notwithstanding, God had lessons for you to learn that were essential. You need a different mould of character. There is need of your bringing into your character more of Christ. . . . You need the love of Christ. The winning charms of Jesus. Compassion, tenderness, and love need to be cultivated. This will not make you a less successful businessman but will give you greater success. You have valuable traits of character, but without this love, this compassion, you will only be a one-sided, imperfect man.",
