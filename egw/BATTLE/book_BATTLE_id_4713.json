    "word": "Before, and especially after the Minneapolis meeting, I had not union and harmony with you. When you made some acknowledgments in letters received while we were at Adelaide; I was rejoiced, hoping a work had begun that would progress until you would be walking in the light, as Christ is in the light. I have trembled for you lest you would clothe yourself with garments of your own self-righteousness, and would not follow on to know the Lord that you might know his goings forth is prepared as the morning. I have been shown your connection with Captain Eldridge has not been for his good nor your good. You seem to feel some bitterness toward me in that you say, I said you were selfish. Now just how this was stated I cannot now recall. I might have said many things in truth as your case was presented to me, that I have not said, because I knew you were walking in blindness, and knew at that which your feet were stumbling, and anything I might present before you would not be correctly represented to your understanding, and you would not benefit thereby. I have kept silent since receiving your letter. I perused my writings for the one I read on one occasion \n                                                                           1186\nwhen you and quite a number of others were present. I had looked for this during my eleven months illness but could not find it. I sent that which I could find and then decided this testimony was left in Battle Creek. But in the last search made the mystery was explained the first two or three pages were stitched in: I turned these pages over and find the very article I read to no less than thirty. I am relieved to find this, and I will have it copied as soon as possible, and you and others shall have a copy.",
