    "word": "I believe that in Brother Hughes the Lord has sent the right man. We must all work earnestly and intelligently to do the utmost to make this school as God would have it. No man's notions are to be brought in here. No breezes from Battle Creek are to be wafted in. I see I must watch before and behind and on every side to permit nothing to find entrance that has been presented before me as injuring our schools in America. Believe, hope, pray; watch with all diligence, and be afraid of men. I am in more fear of professed believers who are not consecrated to God than of outside influence. We must hold this important position by prayer and watching and working. We must wrestle with God, and pray and work, and work and pray.",
