    "word": "MR No. 903 - Warning Against Centralization\n\n     As the work increases there will be a great and living interest to manage it by human instrumentalities. The work is not to be centered in any one place, not even in Battle Creek. Human wisdom argues that it is more convenient to build up the interests [of the work] where it has already obtained character and influence. Mistakes have been made in this line. Individual and personal responsibility are thus repressed and weakened. The work is the Lord's, and its strength and efficiency are not all to be concentrated in any one place.",
