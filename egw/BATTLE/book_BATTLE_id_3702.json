    "word": "In regard to the journey, it could not have been better for us in July. We made close connections and arrived at Battle Creek Tuesday, ten o'clock p.m. Brother Abbey was waiting for us with sleigh. We telegraphed him soon after leaving Chicago to meet us at 10:05 p.m. It seems very nice to rest in our own home on our own good bed after an absence of nine months.--Letter 24, 1873, pp. 1-2. (To Edson and W. C. White, [March] 1873.)",
