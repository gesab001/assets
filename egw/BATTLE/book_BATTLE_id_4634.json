Smith\n\n                                                    S-20-1891 \n                                            Battle Creek, Mich. \n                                                           Jan. 6, 1891. \n\nDear Brother Smith,--- \n     Since your visit and our conversation I decided to place this in your hands to read yourself, and if necessary I may read it before a select number. I have a copy of the same. After I was so greatly burdened the Tuesday night, the same night I returned from Washington, I felt that I must trace upon paper my true feelings and the things which the Lord revealed to me. You may desire to know these things. When you visited me yesterday Jan. 5 and proposed such a meeting to take place I was glad because I thought that will result in good. But when you stated that you had not had feelings against Eld. Waggoner, and Eld. A.T. Jones, I was surprised. Perhaps you thought thus, but how could you think thus, is a mystery to me. The feelings cherished by yourself and Elder Butler were not only despising the message, but the messengers. But the blindness of mind has come by warring against the light which the Lord designed to come to his people.",
