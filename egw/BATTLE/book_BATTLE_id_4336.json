    "word": "We have been pained as we have had brought to our notice papers, advertisers of sorcery and \n\n\n                -60- \n\nwitchcraft, the work of magicians and all this sort of thing, going on in Battle Creek. Who of you who profess to be children of the living God were presumptuous enough to place yourself anywhere near these powers of darkness? There is in these the manifestation of a power that is above human power. And where is it? It is not all sleight of hand. No, indeed. It is the power of Satan; and just as soon as you begin to bring yourselves in connection with these sorcerers, and give them the least license, you dishonor the God of heaven, and imperil your own souls.",
