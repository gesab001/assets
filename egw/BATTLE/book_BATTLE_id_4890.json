Yesterday I sent you a telegram, in which I told you to publish in the Review and Herald the articles you have written regarding the reopening of the Battle Creek College. I felt \n\n\n                                   - 9 - \n\nthat I could not but consent to the publication of this article. The light given me by the Lord--that our youth should not collect in Battle Creek to obtain their education has in no particular been changed. The fact that the Sanitarium has been rebuilt in Battle Creek does not change the light. All that in the past made Battle Creek a place unsuitable for our youth exists today, so far as influence is concerned.",
