    "word": "Elder Washburn remained to hold meetings Sunday [night]. I was not well. My heart troubled me. Great pain was in my heart, something of the same nature that I suffered in California. I could sleep but little that night. We decided when this pain came on me so unexpectedly that I would not be able to attend the meetings we designed in Philadelphia, Ohio, and Williamsport. As I had no appointments out it was thought best to return home to Battle Creek. All urged us to do this when they learned how sick I was.--Ms. 53, 1890, pp. 18-20 (Diary 16, pp. 439-442).",
