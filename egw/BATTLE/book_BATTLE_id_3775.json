    "word": "MR No. 974 - The Results of Selfishness\n\n     The spirit that leavened you at Minneapolis was with you during your service in the Office [THE REVIEW AND HERALD WAS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS \"THE OFFICE.\"] at Battle Creek; it was the confederacy formed with the very men you now condemn which led you to do many things contrary to the principles of the commandments of God. Selfishness was inwrought in your course of action, and this is why you are not connected with the Office today. The Lord's hand was in the whole matter.--Letter 10, 1895. (To F. E. Belden, June 9, 1895.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 31, 1983",
