    "word": "(124) While we were in Australia we worked as medical missionaries in every sense of the word. At times I made my home in Cooranbong, an asylum for the sick, and afflicted. My secretary, who had received a training in the Battle Creek Sanitarium, stood by my side, and did the work of a missionary nurse. No charge was made for her services, and we won the confidence of the people by the interest that we manifested in the sick and suffering. After a time the Health Retreat at Cooranbong was built, and then we were relieved of this burden. \n\n                                               -",
