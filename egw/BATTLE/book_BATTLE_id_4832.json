    "word": "In time of pressure there are spiritual forces to be called in which should always share the burdens; but more than this, the field should be apportioned off in sections to men who will stand as burden-bearers. There must be a number of forces which may be relied upon, but must not be held in one position of responsibility year after year. The field is too large for this. We have learned to send every petty request to Battle Creek, until the elevated sacred work has passed through so many human elements that it has become contaminated. The tainted influence of unsanctified human nature has been brought in, so that nothing is sure, sacred, and holy. But it is little use to make appeals to the men who have held their superior position until in their mind the sacred is blended with the common.",
