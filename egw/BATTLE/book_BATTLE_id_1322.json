WHITE THAT IN RESPONSE TO THE ADMONITION THAT \n        OUR PEOPLE SHOULD MOVE OUT OF BATTLE CREEK, \n     \"BETWEEN ONE AND TWO HUNDRED\" WERE PREPARING TO \n        LEAVE \"AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\"--COMPILERS.] \n\n\n     Your letter tells me, my brother, that there are many who are stirred deeply to move out of Battle Creek. There is need, great need, of this work being done, and now. Those who have felt at last to make a move, let it not be in a rush, in an excitement, or in a rash manner, or in a way that hereafter they will deeply regret that they did move out. . . .",
