    "word": "MR No. 1216 - Experience Following the 1888 Minneapolis Conference; The Danger of Legalism; Emphasizing Religious Liberty\n\n     We found when we reached Battle Creek that some of our brethren and sisters had been preceding us with letters from the meeting of the same character that we had met at the meeting, evidencing that those who made these reports had not received at that meeting the benefit that the Lord designed they should have. There were also a number of delegates who returned to Battle Creek before us who were forward to make reports of the meeting at Minneapolis, giving their own incorrect version of the matter, which was unfavorable to Brethren A. T. Jones and E. J. Waggoner, W. C. White and myself, and the work I had been compelled to do at that meeting. Some who had not seen me since the General Conference in Oakland, California, met me as almost a stranger.",
