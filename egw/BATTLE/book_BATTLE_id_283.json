    "word": "Stormy Times Are Before Us \n\n     This disaster [the burning of the Review and Herald building] may make a decided change in affairs. I hope that our brethren will heed the lesson that God is trying to teach them, and that they will not rebuild the publishing house in Battle Creek. God means that we shall not locate in the cities; for there are very stormy times before us.--Letter 2, 1903.",
