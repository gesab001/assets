The Lord does not want a second Jerusalem in Battle Creek. There will have to be strong reformations and transformations and transferring of facilities and institutions if the will of God is done. Short-sighted mortals can not discern that crowding so much into Battle Creek is taking away from other localities opportunities and privileges which they so much need, and which God designs they should have.\" \n                                                                           6",
