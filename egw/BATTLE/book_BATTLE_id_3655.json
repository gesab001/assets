    "word": "MR No. 837 - The Battle Creek College Debt\n\n     Recently some have questioned the propriety of sending in means for the Missionary Acre Fund, and consequently scarcely anything is now being received for the payment of the college debt. This is not as it should be. Let all our brethren and sisters understand that the purchase of the Battle Creek College property, for the use of the Medical Missionary College, was approved of God, and that the Missionary Acre Fund plan of raising means for this purchase, is a good enterprise. Those who will help in this way will be blessed.--Manuscript 123, 1903, p. 5. (\"The Battle Creek College Debt,\" October 8, 1903.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 25, 1981",
