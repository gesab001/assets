    "word": "The Sabbath school at Battle Creek is like a well regulated machine, like a clock which strikes at regular periods the hour of the day, and the real heart and soul is not there as it should be to prove a success. More of God's and less of man's work would be an improvement. The thought and time given to this mechanical working, if given to the spiritual and religious interest, would have altogether a better effect. More devotion, piety, and simplicity of godliness is essential. The same principle is needed in conducting of the college--more of the Spirit of the Lord and a dropping out of self. Diligence, perseverance, and zeal are needed, but exercised with the Spirit of Christ.",
