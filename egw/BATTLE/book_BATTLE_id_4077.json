    "word": "When the power of the truth is felt in the heart, when the truth is brought into the daily life, there will be a great movement of reform in the Battle Creek church. Then will be fulfilled the word, \"I will turn and overturn.\" We know not now just when this will be accomplished, but the time will come when there will be a scattering from Battle Creek. Those who moved to Battle Creek with no call from the Lord, will move away. Those who came to Battle Creek when they had a work to do in the church that they left, lost their missionary spirit and discernment in coming to Battle Creek. There they came in contact with a Phariseeism, a self-righteousness, and worldliness, that is always a snare. It is the form of godliness without the power thereof. \n\n                                                                --",
