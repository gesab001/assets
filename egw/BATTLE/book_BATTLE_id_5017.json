    "word": "In all our institutions there are many who are deficient in knowledge, who might be fitted to do a much better work, if they made the best use of the opportunities and privileges which God has given them. These will boast of their knowledge, when they are very ignorant of the things which they ought to know. If they knew themselves better, they would have a sense of their inefficiency; they would grasp the higher rounds of the ladder, without climbing with painstaking efforts round after round to reach this elevation. It is much easier to boast than to execute. In these institutions we have it (illegible corrections) a most puzzling question how to keep managers and helpers in harmonious working order. The very best kind of material is needed for the upbuilding of institutions for the sick. We have had an experience from the first establishment of the institution in the city of Battle Creek, and in the institution at St. Helena, and we feel compelled to say that it has cost much time and great amount of perplexity, and quite an amount of money, to get these institutions in working order. There have been counsels and painful reproofs given, most earnest entreaties and appeals made; one set of workmen discharged because inefficient, and others have been placed in their place. Step by step a little has been gained here and there. There has been much said in order to keep out licentious practices and improper familiarity between men and women. This has to be met and reproved, and constantly guarded against, and the ones that are corrected become angry; in the place of reforming, they try to work their revenge upon the faithful workers in the institution. My own soul has been weighed down with burdens that are inexpressible, as I have tried in the fear of God to do my duty to all parties and to the institution. \n\n                                               -",
