We had a car all to ourselves, and there were thirty-two who composed our company. We came through without accident or harm. We were blessed of the Lord with good weather and pleasant company. W. C. White and his two children, Ella May White and Mabel White, their grandmother--Sister Kelsey--and their cousin Reba Kelsey, left us for Colorado Sunday at five o'clock a.m. We arrived at Battle Creek Tuesday, October 15, 1889. I had taken a cold and had not much rest because of a diseased tooth.",
