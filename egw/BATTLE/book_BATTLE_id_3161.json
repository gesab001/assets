    "word": "When Bro. Andrews has come to Battle Creek from time to time, he has overtaxed his strength in doing too much. Had he done only those things which needed to be done, which could not be done away from Battle Creek, his strength would have been sufficient for the burden and tax. But there has been a failure in doing those things which he should not have done, and in not doing those things which were positively necessary to be done. Bro. Andrews allowed his mind to take hold of subjects that were not important for the time, and which had no special bearing upon the \n                                                                           188\nwork which was suffering to be done at Battle Creek, and in order to have done properly, called him hundreds of miles to do. When where the work was, Bro. Andrews did not feel and see its importance, and lay hold of it, and make it a specialty. He followed the bent of his mind, and became interested in Bible subjects, and when absorbed in his favorite Bible studies, he cannot see what is to be done, and work to advantage. The subject before him is the all-absorbing theme. Health has been sacrificed by night labor. He has robbed himself of rest and sleep, using up his vigor in doing things which could just as well be done at his own home in Rochester. The extra amount which he need not have done has severely taxed both physical and mental strength.",
