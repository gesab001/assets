My brethren and sisters, you have need now to consider carefully your course of action. Where will those be found who continue in a course of rebellion against God? I am bidden to repeat to you this message: \"Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with His people, and He will plead with Israel. O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against Me.\"",
