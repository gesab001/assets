    "word": "MR No. 809 - Warning Not to Join J. H. Kellogg\n\n     Dear Brother: About two years ago the Lord presented your case before me, showing me that you were in danger of linking up with the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Instruction has been given me that your mind is certainly being corrupted in sentiment. Sometimes when your assent is given to Dr. Kellogg's assertions, you bear testimony to a lie, and the recording angel writes it thus. Unless Dr. Kellogg changes, confesses his sins and is converted, the Lord will leave him to his own devices. I am charged to give you decided warning lest your mind shall run in the same groove.",
