    "word": "Need of Reformation. \n\n     I wrote, some time since, in reference to the Oakland Office, and then my guide revealed to me that the same spirit, in a more decided manner leavened the Office at Battle Creek; and there were souls lost, eternally lost, through the influence of words of severity and of harshness. Things will transpire in our institutions that will need adjustment, and at once; but let the reformation be made with a spirit to restore, not to destroy. We are fearfully behind in the work of Christ for the saving of souls. We have not that sharp conception of duty required by the truth which we profess to love and honor. We allow \n\n\n                       -3- \n\na freezing atmosphere to surround our souls; we withhold words that ought to be spoken from the Scriptures. In order to fulfil our duty as God's faithful watchmen, we should give words of correction in humility of mind, \"considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\" Neglect not to bind up, with your reproof, words of encouragement. Be cheerful, but not light and trifling; pray for discernment, for a wholesome Christlike spirit. Paul, in his letter to the Philippians, said, \"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; that ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ; being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.\"",
