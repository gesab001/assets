    "word": "The religion of Christ, I testify, is not one of gloom but of gladness. But when the gloom comes, then we must battle. Fight every inch by faith until we can triumph in faith. While we have cause to grieve over the sinfulness of others, we must pray more and cling more firmly to the promises.--Letter 13, 1887. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. October 30, 1986. Entire Letter.",
