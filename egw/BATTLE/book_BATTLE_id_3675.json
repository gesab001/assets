    "word": "SDA Institutions Should Scatter Out, Not Centralize--I have received your letter of August 18. Yesterday I sent you a telegram, in which I told you to publish in the Review and Herald the article you have written regarding \n\n\n                                  -42- \n\nthe reopening of the Battle Creek College. I felt that I could not but consent to the publication of this article. The light given me by the Lord --that our youth should not collect in Battle Creek to receive their education--has in no particular been changed. The fact that the sanitarium has been rebuilt in Battle Creek does not change the light. All that in the past made Battle Creek a place unsuitable for our youth exists today so far as influence is concerned.",
