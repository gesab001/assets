    "word": "The present age is one of show and surface work in education. Bro. Bell possesses naturally a love for system and thoroughness, and these have become habit by lifelong training and discipline. He has been approved of God for this. His labors are of real worth because he will not allow students to be superficial. But in his very first efforts to establish a school in Battle Creek he encountered many obstacles. Had he been less resolute and persevering, he would have given up the struggle. Some of the parents neglected to sustain the school, and their children did not respect the teacher because he wore poor clothing. They allowed his appearance to prejudice them against him. This spirit of disrespect was rebuked of the Lord, and Bro. Bell was encouraged in his work. But the complaints and unwise reports carried home by the children, strengthened the prejudice of the parents. While Bro. Bell was seeking to inculcate true principles and establish right habits, over-indulged children were complaining of their taxing studies. These very ones, I was shown, were suffering because the mind was not sufficiently occupied with proper subjects. Their thoughts were upon demoralizing matters, and both mind and body were enfeebled through the habit of self-abuse. It was this vile practice, not over-study, that caused the frequent illness of these children, and prevented them from making the advancement which the parents desired.",
