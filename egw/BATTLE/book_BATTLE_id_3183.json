    "word": "The Jews did not go into darkness all at once. It was a gradual work, until they could not discern the gift of God in sending his Son. The church at Battle Creek have had superior advantages, and they will be judged by the light and privileges they have had. Their deficiencies, their unbelief, their hardness of heart and neglect to cherish and follow the light, are not less than the favored Jews, who refused. the blessings they might have accepted, and crucified the Son of God. This people are now an astonishment and reproach to the world.",
