    "word": "The means from Battle Creek and Pacific Press are needed here. I have not been able to learn how I stand. I have drawn all but thirty pounds from the Echo Office. First get your family settled, and then, if you desire, and it seems to be duty, you can visit the churches. There is need of your being here soon. The Lord will guide you. We want all the means that we can obtain now, to help in putting up the buildings that are essential for the school and chapel. I shall do all that I can in this enterprise.
