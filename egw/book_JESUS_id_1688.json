{"word": "Then Jesus' silver trumpet sounded, as He descended on the cloud, wrapped in flames of fire. He gazed on the graves of the sleeping saints, then raised His eyes and hands to heaven, and cried, \"Awake! awake! awake! ye that sleep in the dust, and arise.\" Then there was a mighty earthquake. The graves opened, and the dead came up clothed with immortality. The 144,000 shouted, \"Alleluia!\" as they recognized their friends who had been torn from them by death, and in the same moment we were changed and caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 34}
