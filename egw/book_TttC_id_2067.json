    "word": "The Lord would have done a great and good work in this vicinity last spring had all felt the need of this work and come up to the help of the Lord. There was not unity of action. All did not feel the necessity of the work and engage in it heartily. There was not a surrendering of all to God. You were shown me as being troubled and perplexed, a mist of darkness gathering over you. You were questioning and were not in a position to receive strength yourselves nor to impart it to others. It is a solemn, fearful time. There is no time now for cherishing idols, no place for concord with Belial or for friendship with the world. Those whom God accepts and sanctifies to Himself are called to be diligent and faithful in His service, being set apart and devoted to Him. It is not a form of godliness, nor a name upon the church records, that constitutes \"a living stone\" in the spiritual building. It is being renewed in knowledge and true holiness, being crucified to the world and made alive in Christ, that unites the soul to God. The followers of Christ have one leading object in view, one great work: the salvation of their fellow men. Every other interest should be inferior to this; it should engage the most earnest effort and the deepest interest.",
