That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, \n                                                                           99\nand against the high towers. And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord.\"",
