{"word": "Chap. Fifty-Eight - The Minister's Family\n\n     Home Life of Minister to Exemplify Message.-- God designs that in his home life the teacher of the Bible shall be an exemplification of the truths that he teaches.

Patience, consistency, and love will make an impression on hearts that sermons fail to reach.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AH", "page": 353}
