{"word": "The truest, the most exalted, knowledge is found in the Word of God. In its simplicity there is eloquence. There are those who will grasp the words of the supposed great men of the world, and love to dwell upon their phraseology as something they need to esteem and value. You will hear men exalting human beings, extolling those who are called great by this world. In doing this, they lose sight of Christ in the Word. He is not to them all and in all,--the first, the last, the best, in everything. These need to sit at the feet of Jesus, and learn of Him whom to know aright is life eternal.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 70}
