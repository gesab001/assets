    "word": "Christ alone can do this. His gospel in the hearts and hands of His followers is the power which is to accomplish this great work. \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!\" By Himself becoming subject to Satan's misrepresentations, Christ made it possible for the work of redemption to be accomplished.
