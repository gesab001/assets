    "word": "The minister of God is commanded: \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\" The Lord says of these people: \"They seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways, as a nation that did righteousness.\" Here is a people who are self-deceived, self-righteous, self-complacent, and the minister is commanded to cry aloud and show them their transgressions. In all ages this work has been done for God's people, and it is needed now more than ever before.",
