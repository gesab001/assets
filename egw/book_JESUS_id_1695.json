{"word": "The worshipers of God will be especially distinguished by their regard for the fourth commandment, since this is the sign of God's creative power and the witness to His claim upon man's reverence and homage. The wicked will be distinguished by their efforts to tear down the Creator's memorial and to exalt the institution of Rome. In the issue of the conflict all Christendom will be divided into two great classes, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark. Although church and state will unite their power to compel all, \"both \n40\nsmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\" to receive the mark of the beast, yet the people of God will not receive it. Revelation 13:16. The prophet of Patmos beholds \"them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God,\" and singing the song of Moses and the Lamb. Revelation 15:2.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 39}
