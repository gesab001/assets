{"word": "52: Jesus as Model Pastor\n \n\nCompilers' note: Jesus never pastored a church congregation such as we have today. But, like today's pastors, He did preach and teach, and minister both to large groups and to individuals. It is helpful to pastors of small churches to realize that the closest He came to pastoring a specific congregation was his ongoing ministry to a tiny group of twelve. It should be encouraging to pastors who sometimes feel their failure, to realize that even Jesus could not keep one of those twelve from apostasy. In the Ellen White quotations below, it is noteworthy how often Jesus is called the Chief Shepherd, and ministers to His under-shepherds. He is the minister's model.\n \n\n     Christ, the chief Shepherd, provides the perfect model for His undershepherds.--Christ is the Chief Shepherd. He has intrusted the care of His flock to under shepherds. He requires these shepherds to have the same interest for His sheep which He has ever manifested, and to ever feel the responsibility of the charge He has intrusted to them. Ministers, who are called of God to labor in word and doctrine, are Christ's shepherds. He has appointed them under Himself to oversee and tend His flock. He has solemnly commanded these to be faithful shepherds, to feed the flock with diligence, to follow His example, to strengthen the weak, nourish the fainting, and to shield them from devouring beasts. He points them to His example of love for His sheep. To secure their deliverance, He laid down His life for them. If they imitate His self-denying example, the flock will prosper under their care.--3SG 123.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 281}
