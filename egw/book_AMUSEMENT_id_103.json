{"word": "Young men, as well as young women, often manifest a sad lack of earnest purpose and moral independence. To dress, to smoke, to talk nonsense, and to indulge \n98\ntheir passion for amusement, is the ideal of happiness, even with many who profess to be Christians. It is painful to think of the time thus misspent. Hours that should be given to the study of the Scriptures or to active labor of Christ, are worse than wasted. Life was given for a true and holy purpose. It is too precious to be thus squandered. I entreat you who have taken the name of Christ, Examine your hearts, and pass sentence upon yourselves. Do you not love pleasure more than you love God or your fellow-men? There is work to be done; there are souls to save; there are battles to fight; there is a heaven to win. The mind, with all its capabilities, must be strengthened, and stored with the treasures of divine wisdom. In the strength of God you may do noble work for the Master.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CTBH", "page": 97}
