{"word": "Communion bread must be unleavened.--The broken bread and pure juice of the grape are to represent the broken body and spilled blood of the Son of God. Bread that is leavened must not come on the communion table; unleavened bread is the only correct representation of the Lord's Supper. Nothing fermented is to be used. Only the pure fruit of the vine and the unleavened bread are to be used.--RH June 7, 1898.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 171}
