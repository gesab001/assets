{"word": "Meat Excites and Strengthens Lower Passions.-- Meat should not be placed before our children. Its influence is to excite and strengthen the lower passions, and has a tendency to deaden the moral powers. Grains and fruits prepared free from grease and in as natural a condition as possible should be the food for the tables of all who claim to be preparing for translation to heaven. The less feverish the diet, the more easily can the passions be controlled. Gratification of taste should not be consulted irrespective of physical, intellectual, or moral health.--2T 352 (1869).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 236}
