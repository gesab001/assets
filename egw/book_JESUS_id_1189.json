{"word": "7: A Vision of the New Earth\n\n[AT THE TIME OF ANOTHER VISIT AT THE HOME OF MRS. HAINES, ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE FIRST VISION, THERE WAS GIVEN TO MISS HARMON A VISION OF THE NEW EARTH, AND THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY CITY, WHICH TAKES PLACE AT THE END OF THE THOUSAND YEARS AFTER CHRIST'S SECOND ADVENT. REVELATION 21:10-27; ZECHARIAH 14:4.]\n \n     With Jesus at our head we all descended from the city down to this earth, on a great and mighty mountain, which could not bear Jesus up, and it parted asunder, and there was a mighty plain. Then we looked up and saw the great city, with twelve foundations, and twelve gates, three on each side, and an angel at each gate. We all cried out, \"The city, the great city, it's coming, it's coming down from God out of heaven,\" and it came and settled on the place where we stood.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 62}
