    "word": "Prayer is the most holy exercise of the soul. It should be sincere, humble, earnest--the desires of a renewed heart breathed in the presence of a holy God. When the suppliant feels that he is in the divine presence, self will be forgotten. He will have no desire to display human talent; he will not seek to please the ear of men, but to obtain the blessing which the soul craves. \n                                                                           202",
