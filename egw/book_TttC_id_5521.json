He is pitied by the heavenly angels, for he is surrounded with darkness. His ears hear words of unbelief and darkness almost continually. He has doubts and questionings constantly thrown before him. The tongue is a world of iniquity. \"The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly \n                                                                           237\nevil, full of deadly poison.\" If Brother J would cling to God more firmly and feel that he should preserve his integrity before God even at the cost of his natural life, he would receive strength from above. If he allows his faith to be affected by the darkness and unbelief that surrounds him--the doubts and questioning and much talk--he will soon be all darkness and doubt and unbelief, and will have no light or strength in the truth.",
