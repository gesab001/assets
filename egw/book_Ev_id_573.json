{"word": "God Will Give Fit Words.--What a privilege it is to labor for the conversion of souls! Our calling is high. . . . To fit us to do this work, He will strengthen our mental faculties as verily as He did the mind of Daniel. As we teach those in darkness to understand the truths that have enlightened us, God will teach us to understand these truths still better ourselves. He will give us apt words to speak, communicating to us through the angel standing by our side.-- Manuscript 126, 1902.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 172}
