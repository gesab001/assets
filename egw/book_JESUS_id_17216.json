{"word": "Why are we so cold? Why are we worldly? Why are we so careless? Why does not the love of Jesus burn upon the altar of our hearts? He carried the burden of our sins, of our sorrows; why do we not have greater faith? Why do we not trust fully and receive by faith everything from that hand which was nailed to the cross that it might be all powerful to save? Why cannot we trust that love which has been expressed to us in such infinite sacrifice that we might live?", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 176}
