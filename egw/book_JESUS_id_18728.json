{"word": "This is the privilege of every believer today. It is man dwelling with God, and God taking up His abode with man. \"I in them, and thou in me\" (John 17:23), says Jesus. To walk with God and have the witness that their ways please Him is an experience not to be confined to Enoch, to Elijah, to patriarchs, to prophets, to apostles, and to martyrs. It is not only the privilege but the duty of every follower of Christ to have Jesus enshrined in the heart, to carry Him with them in their lives; and they will indeed be fruit-bearing trees.--The Upward Look, p. 228.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 253}
