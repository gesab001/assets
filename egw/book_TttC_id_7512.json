    "word": "The selfishness which exists among God's people is very offensive to Him. The Scriptures denounce covetousness as idolatry. No \"covetous man,\" says Paul, \"who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.\" The trouble with many is that they have too little faith. Like the rich man in the parable they want to see their supplies piled up in their granaries. The world is to be warned, and God wants us wholly engaged in His work; but men have so much to do to forward their money-making projects that they have no time to push the triumphs of the cross of Christ. They have neither time nor disposition to put their intellect, tact, and energy into the cause of God. \n                                                                           271",
