{"word": "The teacher should ever conduct himself as a Christian gentleman. He should stand in the attitude of a friend and counselor to his pupils. If all our people--teachers, ministers, and lay members--would cultivate the spirit of Christian courtesy, they would far more readily find access to the hearts of the people; many more would be led \n                                                                           94\nto examine and receive the truth. When every teacher shall forget self, and feel a deep interest in the success and prosperity of his pupils, realizing that they are God's property, and that he must render an account for his influence upon their minds and characters, then we shall have a school in which angels will love to linger. Jesus will look approvingly upon the work of the teachers and will send His grace into the hearts of the students. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 93}
