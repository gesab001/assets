And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot\" (1 Peter 1:13-19).--Pamphlet published in 1893, Should Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? \n                                                                           140", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 139}
