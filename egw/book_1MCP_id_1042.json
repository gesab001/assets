{"word": "Parties of Pleasure.--Many allow the youth to attend parties of pleasure, thinking that amusement is essential for health and happiness; but what dangers are in this path! The more the desire for pleasure is gratified, the more it is cultivated and the stronger it becomes. The life experience is largely made up of self-gratification in amusement. God bids us beware. \"Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall\" (1 Corinthians 10:12).--CT 347 (1913).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 315}
