{"word": "Living the truth, practicing the lessons of Christ, always refines, ennobles, and sanctifies the soul. My burden is to uplift men and women by uplifting Jesus before them. When God is recognized as the theme of all thoughts, as the object of love, reverence, and worship; when the Lord Jesus, the Pattern, is kept before the mind, the heart is being cleansed from all moral defilement. Then the soul becomes an accurate judge of propriety of action; every attitude is touched with grace.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 371}
