{"word": "I hope soon to visit the soldiers' home at Yountville. For several months a company of workers have been going there every other Sabbath to hold a song service. At first only a few attended the services, but now there are from seventy-five to one hundred present every time. Sometimes a thirty-minute talk on some Bible subject is given. At a meeting held a few weeks ago, the soldiers were asked if they would like to have a short Bible study after the song service. About a dozen said they would. But when the time came for the reading to be held, over fifty were present. The workers take reading matter with them, and when the soldiers are asked whether they would like it, their faces light up, and their hands are eagerly stretched out to receive the books and papers.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 181}
