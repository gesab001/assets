    "word": "\"AS I SPENT ALL MY MONEY IN COMING HERE, AND WAS INVITED TO HAVE A HOME IN BROTHER THOMPSON'S FAMILY, I HAVE BEEN ASSISTING SISTER THOMPSON IN HER DOMESTIC AFFAIRS AND SEWING, AT ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS PER WEEK OF FIVE DAYS EACH, AS THEY DO NOT WISH ME TO WORK FOR THEM ON SUNDAY, AND I DO NOT WORK ON THE SABBATH OF THE LORD, THE ONLY ONE THE BIBLE RECOGNIZES. THEY ARE NOT AT ALL ANXIOUS TO HAVE ME LEAVE THEM, NOTWITHSTANDING OUR DIFFERENCE OF BELIEF; AND HE SAYS I MAY HAVE A HOME WITH THEM, ONLY I MUST NOT MAKE MY BELIEF PROMINENT AMONG HIS PEOPLE. HE HAS EVEN INVITED ME TO FILL HIS APPOINTMENTS WHEN ON HIS PREACHING TOUR, AND I HAVE DONE SO. SISTER THOMPSON NEEDS A GOVERNESS FOR HER CHILDREN, AS THE INFLUENCES ARE SO VERY PERNICIOUS OUTSIDE, AND THE SCHOOLS SO VICIOUS THAT SHE IS NOT WILLING TO SEND HER DEAR ONES AMONG THEM UNTIL THEY ARE CHRISTIANS, AS SHE SAYS. THEIR ELDEST SON, TODAY SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE, IS A PIOUS AND DEVOTED YOUNG MAN. THEY HAVE PARTIALLY ADOPTED THE HEALTH REFORM, AND I THINK WILL FULLY COME INTO IT ERELONG, AND LIKE IT. HE HAS ORDERED THE HEALTH REFORMER. I SHOWED HIM SOME COPIES WHICH I BROUGHT.",
