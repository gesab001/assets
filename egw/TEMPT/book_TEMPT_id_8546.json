    "word": "Let our institutions guard against employing those who are not skillful in the preparation of food. To prepare dishes that will recommend health reform requires tact and knowledge. There are some who are called good cooks who understand only how to prepare meat and vegetables and the general round of diet used in the world. But we need cooks who are educated in hygienic methods, so that they can prepare dishes that will be both palatable and wholesome. There is a great dearth of cooks of this character, and I know that many of our most precious, able men have died because of improper diet. There was placed upon their tables hot saleratus biscuits, and dishes of a similar character. The students in our schools should be educated so that they can prepare food in a tasteful, healthful manner. They should know how to make good, sweet, thoroughly baked bread; but it is not essential that they understand how to make a great variety of cake and be able to prepare knickknacks to tempt the appetite.",
