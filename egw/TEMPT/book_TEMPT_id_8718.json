    "word": "Just such transactions are taking place today. Many place such confidence in their own ideas that they present their theories as if they could make no mistake. Once their words are spoken they never go back, never repent, never feel that they need forgiveness. They feel that they are simply infallible. Thus it has been in past history; thus it will be again. Religious confidence becomes infallibility. How can these deluded ones think that they are the only ones led and taught of God? When this spirit is manifested, what can be done? You cannot convince them, because they say, \"God has led me.\" They will not acknowledge that they have acted from wrong principles. They maintain that they have moved rightly. The only course that can be pursued is to leave them to develop their principles. They may never see their errors, but others may be convinced and saved. To attempt to unmask them would be to call sympathy to their side.",
