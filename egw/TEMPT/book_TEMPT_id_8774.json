    "word": "The youth were pointed to the mother who had led a terrible life through the father's habits of strong drink. The children, when solicited by temptation, have less moral power than had the father. For this reason, their only safety is entire, total abstinence. The words were spoken, \"Warn the mother to stand in firm independence to warn and command her children.\" She needs the help of her elder children.
