    "word": "Chap. 30 - Care in Speaking of Others\n\n     Good Qualities in Others--Cultivate the habit of speaking well of others. Dwell upon the good qualities of those with whom you associate, and see as little as possible of their errors and failings. When tempted to complain of what someone has said or done, praise something in that person's life or character. Cultivate thankfulness. Praise God for His wonderful love in giving Christ to die for us.-- MH 492.",
