    "word": "The work of the true medical missionary is largely a spiritual work. It includes prayer and laying on of hands; he therefore should be as sacredly set apart for his work as is the minister of the gospel. Those who are selected to act the part of missionary physicians, are to be set apart as such. This will strengthen them against the temptations to withdraw from the sanitarium work to engage in private practice. No selfish motive should be allowed to draw the worker from his post of duty. We are living in a time of solemn responsibility; a time when consecrated work is to be done. Let us seek the Lord \n\n\n                             -357- \n\ndiligently and understandingly. If we will let the Lord work upon human hearts, we shall see a great and grand work accomplished.",
