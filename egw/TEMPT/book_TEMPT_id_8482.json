    "word": "My brother, improve the opportunity offered you to gain an understanding of the words. \"We are laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" [1 Corinthians 3:9]. You will then have confidence in the forgiving and pardoning mercy of God's love, and you will reveal a Christlike zeal for the advancement of His work. True repentance will bring newness of life. An entire change in mind and character will be brought about by the effectual working of the Holy Spirit. The pride and confidence that tempts human beings to rise up in mistaken independence will be expelled from the soul.",
