    "word": "The Lord is soon to come. Wickedness and rebellion, violence and crime, are filling the world. The cries of the suffering and the oppressed rise to Him for justice. In the place of being softened by the patience and forbearance of God, the wicked are growing stronger in stubborn rebellion. The time in which we live is one of marked  depravity. Religious restraint is thrown off, and men reject the law of God. . . . A more than common contempt is placed upon this holy law.",
