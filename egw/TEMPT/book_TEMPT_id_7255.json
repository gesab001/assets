    "word": "My brother, Christ loves you. He has shown you how much He loves you. I cannot find words to tell you how greatly you have disappointed Him in the past. You have allowed the enemy to sway you, first in one way and then in another, and the tempter has exulted as you have given way to his temptations. You must have an entirely different experience before Christ can say to you,\" Well done, thou good and faithful servant; . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" Matthew 25:21. When you are thoroughly converted, you will be kept by the power of God from exhibiting the weak points in your character.",
