    "word": "God has His faithful witnesses who are not attempting to do that which Christ has pronounced impossible--that is, seeking to serve God and mammon at the same time. They are burning and shining lights amid the moral darkness of the world, and amid the gross darkness that covers the people like the pall of death. The members of the church of Christ are individually to be controlled by the Holy Spirit, in order that they may not have a changeable, fluctuating experience. They are to be rooted and grounded in the truth.",
