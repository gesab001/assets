    "word": "Religious faith and principles have become deteriorated, mingled with worldly customs and practices, and for this reason pure and undefiled religion is rare. The soul, the precious soul, is of value, and it must be made white in the blood of the Lamb. The strength and grace of God was provided at infinite sacrifice that you might be victorious over Satan's suggestions and temptations, and come forth unsullied and unpolluted as did Joseph and Daniel. Let the life, the character, be the strongest argument for Christianity, for by this will all men be compelled to take knowledge of you that you have been with Jesus and learned of him. The life, the words, and the deportment are the most forcible argument, the most solemn appeal to the careless, irreverent, and skeptical. Let not medical students be deceived by the wiles of the devil, or by any of his cunning pretexts which so many adopt to beguile and ensnare by practices of the ungodly. Cling closely to your Bibles. Inquire, What saith the Lord? He has spoken and told me how to ennoble and purify my life. This light I will follow. The Majesty of truth I will respect and honor.",
