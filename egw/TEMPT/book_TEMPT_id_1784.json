    "word": "\"The way of transgressors is hard,\" but wisdom's \"ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\" Proverbs 13:15; 3:17. Every act of obedience to Christ, every act of self-denial for His sake, every trial well endured, every victory gained over temptation, is a step in the march to the glory of final victory. If we take Christ for our guide, He will lead us safely. \n                                                                           75",
