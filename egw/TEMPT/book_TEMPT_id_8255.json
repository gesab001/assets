    "word": "Now I know something about that door that no man can open or shut. I know as I come to God and offer my prayer, as [did] Christ upon the banks of \n\n\n                                 -262- \n\nJordan, that I will have the blessing of God resting upon me. I know something of this world, and although Satan may thrust his temptations into my mind, I look beyond to One who is mighty to save, and He says, \"I know thy works.\" Every effort we make to bless humanity around us is recognized in heaven. But we frequently neglect the work and serve God with a divided mind. If we ask God for anything, we must not have our minds one-half of the time on God and the other half on our own selves.",
