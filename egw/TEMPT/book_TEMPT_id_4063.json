    "word": "In the church at home the children are to learn to pray and to trust in God. Teach them to repeat God\u2019s law. Concerning the commandments the Israelites were instructed: \u201cThou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\u201d Deuteronomy 6:7. Come in humility, with a heart full of tenderness, and with a sense of the temptations and dangers before yourselves and your children; by faith bind them to the altar, entreating for them the care of the Lord. Train the children to offer their simple words of prayer. Tell them that God delights to have them call upon Him.\u2014(Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 110.)",
