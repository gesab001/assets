    "word": "Angels ministered to Christ, but their presence did not make His life one of ease and freedom from temptation. He \"was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\" [Hebrews 4:15.] If ministers, while engaged in the work that the Master has appointed them, have trials and perplexities and temptations, should they be discouraged? Should they cast away their confidence because their labors do not always bring the results that they so greatly desire to see? True workers will not despond in view of the work before them, arduous though it may be. Shrinking from hardship, complaining under tribulation, makes the servants of God weak and inefficient.",
