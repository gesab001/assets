    "word": "When Christ told Peter what he should do, Peter answered, \"Lord, and what shall this man do?\" Jesus said, \"What is that to thee? follow thou Me.\" We want to be very jealous of ourselves. We want to examine ourselves and see if we are in the love of God. Unless Jesus is in us, we are reprobates. Every one of us will be tried, and unless we are closely connected with God, the trials that will come upon us will weaken our already weak faith and we shall become the sport of Satan's temptations. But if we are connected with Christ, and draw close to Jesus when these trials come, He will draw nigh to us. Satan will have no victory over us. \"Draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you.\" We must commit the keeping of our souls to God as unto a faithful Creator.",
