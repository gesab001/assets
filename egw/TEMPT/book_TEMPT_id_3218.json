    "word": "Satan Takes Advantage of Inherited Weakness.--In our own strength it is impossible for us to deny the clamors of our fallen nature. Through this channel Satan will bring temptation upon us. Christ knew that the enemy would come to every human being to take advantage of hereditary weakness and by his false insinuations to ensnare all whose trust is not in God. And by passing over the ground which man must travel, our Lord has prepared the way for us to overcome. It is not His will that we should be placed at a disadvantage in the conflict with Satan. . . . \"Be of good cheer,\" He says; \"I have overcome the world\" (John 16:33).--DA 122, 123 (1898).",
