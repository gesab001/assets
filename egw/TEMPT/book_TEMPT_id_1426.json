    "word": "How thankful we should be that Christ took human nature upon Himself, and became subject to temptation, even as we are! Though He took humanity upon Himself, He was divine. All that is attributed to the Father Himself is attributed to Christ. His divinity was clothed with humanity; He was the Creator of heaven and earth; and yet while upon earth, He became weary, as men do, and sought rest from the continual pressure of labor. He who made the ocean, who controls the waters of the great deep, who opened the springs and channels of the earth, felt it necessary to rest at Jacob's well, and to ask a drink of water from a strange Samaritan woman.",
