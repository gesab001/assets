    "word": "I have just been interrupted. Dr. Caro and Brother Sharp have been in. Some time ago I told them that if money did not come without placing themselves in bonds to do thus and so with the income of the Sanitarium, they were to stand still and wait for money to come from other sources. The warning was given just in time; for in about two weeks or less after I had warned them so faithfully not to subscribe to any presentations, nor enter into any contract with any persons, because temptations would come as a result, the temptations came, just as I had told them, and they wrote decidedly that they could not put their names [on any documents] and subscribe \n\n\n                                  -327- \n\nto any of the contracts which Dr. Kellogg had specified. So, you see, the Lord as well as Satan is at work.",
