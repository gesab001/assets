    "word": "One decided evidence we have that these exercises are not of God, is that they concur with your views, which we know to be erroneous. Things she says she sees in vision are not sustained by the Word of God, but are contrary to it. Satan is constantly at work to imbue her with his own spirit, that through her, under a cloak of righteousness, he may bring in commonness, heresies, and defilement. As you regard her utterances as from God, your faith in the true testimonies is valueless; and thus Satan hopes to disconnect you, and all who have any confidence in your ideas, from the agencies that God has ordained, that you may be left to believe a lie. The Scriptures speak of those who are deceived and are being deceived. This is your case. You deceive your daughter; she deceives you--the blind leading the blind. The enemy seeks to accomplish his purposes by various means, as shall best meet the circumstances and situation of those whom he sees he can allure by temptation.",
