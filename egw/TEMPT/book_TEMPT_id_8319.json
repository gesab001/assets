    "word": "Keep Your Eyes on Jesus--God is very near you in your work, angels are close in attendance; then let not any feelings or any words or works of human beings overwhelm you. Rise above all these difficulties so trying to human nature. Every day has its own troubles for every soul who lives. Then do not in any way, by feeling, word, or look, increase the temptations of Satan upon one soul. When tempted to be hasty or passionate, remember Jesus your Pattern. I want you to have the gift of eternal life, and I beg you to seek peace and harmony for your own sake as well as for the sake of those whom God loves, who have devoted their lives to His service. May the Lord help you, strengthen and bless you, is my prayer. . . .",
