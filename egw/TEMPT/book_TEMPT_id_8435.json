    "word": "Let no untruth go forth traced by your pen. The harm you have done to your own soul, and the dishonor to God, should go no farther. God's workmen must continue to bear the blame of being troublers of Israel, but they are not at liberty to make such assertions true. Go not into the assembly of scoffers, sit not in the seat of the scorners, keep away from the gatherings \n\n\n                                  -313- \n\nof those who will make your presence an occasion to speak to you humiliating things, and will pour contempt upon your faith. Have no controversy with these men. You have not to do with the men only, but with Satan and his synagogue. When compelled to meet them, remember the Saviour's words, \"I send you forth as lambs among wolves.\" The Lord must be your dependence; He will clothe you with a divine panoply, and His Holy spirit will influence your mind and heart so that your voice shall not catch the notes of the baying of the wolves.",
