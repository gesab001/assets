    "word": "Grand Lake, Colorado, Sabbath, September 27, 1873. This is a beautiful day; not a cloud in the heavens. I spent the day in writing and reading over manuscript for printer, upon the temptation of Christ in the wilderness. I am anxious to get this before the people, for they need it. After we had prayer at the close of the Sabbath, Brother Glover went out fishing. He caught sixteen fish. We urged him to dress them and take them home to his children, as he had decided to take the pony and go the next day to the Mills and get supplies for us, and have Mr. Walling come for us.",
