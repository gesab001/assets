    "word": "I have written to Elder Uriah Smith words that I wish you could see. The course which has been pursued toward Elder Jones has been an offense to God. When Elder Jones wrote his article in regard to the formation of the image of the beast, Elder Smith without one word of communication to A. T. Jones, put it in the paper. Elder Jones was in the same city, and Elder Smith could have had access to him at any time to talk the matter over. But without saying a word, he published an article directly in opposition to Elder Jones' article. We have had to meet this here in Australia. Souls are in temptation and darkness by reason of it. Our last conference in Melbourne did these tempted souls no good. \"Why,\" one asks, \"should these two men conduct themselves in this way, and present their dissensions to the world?\" Unbelievers have taken advantage of it. Ministers not of our faith are handling the matter, and making all the capital they can out of it. Why, with the Bible in our hands, should we depart so manifestly from its direct precepts? Why should we play into Satan's hands, and give him opportunity to triumph?",
