    "word": "In many homes, the father and mother have allowed the children to rule. Such children are in far greater danger, when brought in contact with influences opposed to godliness than those who have learned to obey. Not having received the necessary training, they think they can do as they please. A knowledge of how to obey would have strengthened them to resist temptation, but this knowledge their parents have not given them. When these undisciplined youth enter an immense institution, where there are many influences opposed to spirituality, they are in grave peril, and often their stay in the institution is an injury to themselves and to the institution.",
