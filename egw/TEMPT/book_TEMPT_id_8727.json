    "word": "You are not in sympathy with the great Head of the church. The church in South Lancaster has had the misfortune to have a large share of unconsecrated, talkative, envious, jealous members to discourage any effort which some are anxious to make to advance the prosperity of the church. This contemptible picking, faultfinding, seeking spot and stain, ridiculing, gainsaying, that you with some others have indulged in, has grieved the Spirit of God and separated you from God.",
