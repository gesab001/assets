    "word": "The foundation on which the truth has always been based is sure, and upon this foundation all are to stand who are doing the Lord's work. God's Word reveals His design; and that work only which is carried on in accordance with the principles of the Word will stand fast forever, approved both by the heavenly host and the adopted family living on the earth during the remnant of time remaining before the close of this earth's history. Finite man, yielding to Satan's devising, can easily lose sight of the Lord's purpose concerning him, for by yielding to temptation, man loses his powers of discernment. Every Christian is to strive to be a laborer together with God.",
