    "word": "Christ never spoke a harsh or an unkind word. When tempted by His associates to do wrong, He would sing from the Psalm, or by some word of Scripture would discourage the enemy. Do not be ashamed to learn of Christ. He invites you, \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:29, 30). When you feel provoked to anger consider that in manifesting this spirit, you are not wearing the yoke of Christ, which is one of obedience, restraint, service.",
