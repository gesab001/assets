    "word": "What can be more dreadful than a minister of Jesus Christ a commandment breaker? I see only one way for your escape--break with the temptations of Satan at once, and rush for the light! Even ministers \n\n\n                                     -161- \n\nwho claim to believe the truth are only blind guides if the truth is not enthroned in the heart, and a thorough transition from darkness to light has [not] taken place. They are clouds without water. I urge upon you, if you care for your own eternal welfare, the positive necessity of having the truth enthroned in your heart, for then its principles will sanctify your character.",
