    "word": "There is no need that any one should tell me of Africa. I know just as well what I would meet there as what my brethren do; for me it would be the hardest field I have ever attempted to work in. The mixture of elements I am acquainted with; for the Lord has opened the situation to me. I am more disinclined to visit Africa since the brethren Wessels have come into possession of the property they have received. I know that this would make it very much harder for me. If the Lord should send them a testimony through me, I fear they would not receive it; I know their peril is greatly increased since they received this property, and if they reject the warnings from God, they will lose their souls. I know that the enemy stands ready to misinterpret all that I may say or write to them: I have been decidedly told by Bro. Phillip Wessels that he wants no more letters from me.",
