    "word": "In every trying situation we are to ask, \"Were Christ placed as I am, what would He do?\" We are to go to God in humble faith, and on our knees give ourselves wholly and entirely to Him. We are to make it our choice to do as Christ would do. Christ has placed every one of us on vantage ground. \"For verily He took not on Him the nature of angels; but He took on Him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able also to succor them that are tempted\" [Hebrews 2:16-18].",
