    "word": "In the same way will those who claim to believe the truth war against the testimonies in collision with their ways, their opinions, and when reproved, they will hate them with an intense hatred, will, like Canright, laugh at them and misconstrue them and pour all the contempt upon them that is possible. We must, if we are true and genuine Christians, be diligent soldiers for Christ and listen attentively to all the warnings given us. The works of sin and all uncleanness must be forever removed, and we must put on the armor of Christ's righteousness, which is proof against all temptations. Then we shall have faithful sentinels.",
