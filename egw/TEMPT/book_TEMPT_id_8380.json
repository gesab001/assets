    "word": "August 19: I was called away from this letter, but will add, Your case is a very perilous one. You are under the control of an unclean spirit. Will you look, and see the course you have pursued in borrowing money of others, and spending money that has come into your hands from any source? Your ideas, and plans, and thoughts, and actions, are all demoralized. You should never again attempt canvassing. You have had a chance, as others have had, but you have appropriated the money in many ways. Will you tell how? You have evidenced that a man may have advantages in education, in pleasing abilities, and this gives him opportunity to be received, to be trusted, and yet disappoint most cruelly, as you have disappointed those, both men and women, who have been deceived by an apparent honesty.",
