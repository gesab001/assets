    "word": "The spiritual weakness of many young men and women in this age is deplorable because they could be powerful agents for good if they were consecrated to God. I mourn greatly the lack of integrity with the young. This we should all deplore. There seems to be a lack of power to do right, a lack of earnest effort to obey the calls of duty rather than of inclination. There \n                                                                           30\nseems to be with some but little strength to resist temptation. The reason of their being dwarfs in spiritual things is because they do not by exercise grow spiritually strong. They stand still when they should be going forward. Every step in the life of faith and duty is a step toward Heaven. I want greatly to hear of a reformation in Battle Creek such as the young have never heretofore realized. I greatly fear the influence of a singing-school in Battle Creek, as such schools are generally conducted. I regard it as a dangerous and solemn time for the youth. Every inducement that Satan can invent is pressed upon them to make them indifferent and careless in regard to eternal things. I suggest that there be special efforts made by the youth to help each other to live faithful to their baptismal vows, and pledge themselves solemnly before God to withdraw their affections from the love of dress and display.",
