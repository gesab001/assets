    "word": "\u201cKnow ye not that . . . ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price.\u201d And what a price it was\u2014the sacrifice of Christ to save a perishing world. . . . All who are united with Christ will come out of the world and be separate. They will not enter into the world from any choice of their own. They will not by their associations place themselves in the way of temptation. They will not be educated in worldly lines. They will choose to come into the school of Christ and learn of the great Teacher. He invites every soul, \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\u201dManuscript 21, 1898.",
