    "word": "ENABLES US TO RESIST TEMPTATION.\u2014Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray, when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven\u2019s storehouse, where are treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence? Without unceasing prayer and diligent watching we are in danger of growing careless and of deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks continually to obstruct the way to the mercy seat, that we may not by earnest supplication and faith obtain grace and power to resist temptation.\u2014(Steps to Christ, 94, 95.)",
