    "word": "During the meeting at Minneapolis, I passed through a painful experience, because of the attitude of our ministering brethren, which I knew was not in harmony with the Spirit of God. Since then I have not been confident that they have been entirely under the control of the Spirit of God, and I have had to admit that under a pressure of circumstances (for reasons that I will not attempt to explain), some of my brethren in the ministry may be led by another spirit. I dare not repose confidence in communication to them concerning other of my brethren, for if favoring circumstances should arise they would make a wrong use of the light given, and injure them or me. I feel sad to state this matter as I do.",
