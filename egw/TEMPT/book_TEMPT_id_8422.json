    "word": "The building you are planning to erect in Battle Creek is not necessary. To invest money in this way would set a wrong example. Our people in Battle Creek have continually been tempted to find some excuse for investing more money in building. Thus other parts of the field have been robbed of buildings which they should have had. There are already more buildings in Battle Creek than there should be in one place. It is a mistake to crowd so many institutions into one place. In this, the wisdom of men, not the wisdom of God, has been shown.",
