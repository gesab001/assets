    "word": "Forgetfulness \n\n     All who profess to be children of God I would invite to consider the history of the Israelites, as recorded in the one hundred and fifth, the one hundred and sixth, and the one hundred and seventh psalms.  By carefully studying these scriptures, we may be able to appreciate more fully the goodness, mercy, and love of our God. \n\n\n                    A Hymn Of The Promised Land \n\n\n     \"Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon His name; \n        Make known among the peoples His doings. \n      Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him; \n        Talk ye of all His marvelous works. \n      Glory ye in His holy name: \n        Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah. \n      Seek ye Jehovah and His strength; \n        Seek His face evermore. \n\n\n     \"Remember His marvelous works that He hath done, \n        His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth, \n      O ye seed of Abraham His servant, \n        Ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones. \n      He is Jehovah our God: \n        His judgments are in all the earth. \n      He hath remembered His covenant forever, \n        The word which He commanded to a thousand generations, \n      The covenant which He made with Abraham, \n        And His oath unto Isaac, \n      And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, \n        To Israel for an everlasting covenant, \n      Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, \n        The lot of your inheritance; \n      When they were but a few men in number, \n        Yea, very few, and sojourners in it. \n      And they went about from nation to nation, \n        From one kingdom to another people. \n      He suffered no man to do them wrong; \n        Yea, He reproved kings for their sakes, \n      Saying, Touch not Mine anointed ones, \n        And do My prophets no harm. \n                                                                           108\n\n     \"And He called for a famine upon the land; \n        He brake the whole staff of bread. \n      He sent a man before them; \n        Joseph was sold for a servant: \n      His feet they hurt with fetters: \n        He was laid in chains of iron, \n      Until the time that His word came to pass, \n        The word of Jehovah tried him. \n      The king sent and loosed him; \n        Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. \n      He made him lord of his house, \n        And ruler of all his substance; \n      To bind his princes at his pleasure. \n        And teach his elders wisdom \n      Israel also came into Egypt; \n        And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. \n      And He increased His people greatly, \n        And made them stronger than their adversaries. \n\n\n     \"He turned their heart to hate His people, \n        To deal subtly with His servants. \n      He sent Moses His servant, \n        And Aaron whom He had chosen. \n      They set among them His signs, \n        And wonders in the land of Ham. \n      He sent darkness, and made it dark; \n        And they rebelled not against His words. \n      He turned their waters into blood, \n        And slew their fish. \n      Their land swarmed with frogs \n        In the chambers of their kings. \n      He spake, and there came swarms of flies, \n        And lice in all their borders. \n      He gave them hail for rain, \n        And flaming fire in their land. \n      He smote their vines also and their fig trees, \n        And brake the trees of their borders. \n      He spake, and the locust came, \n        And the grasshopper, and that without number, \n      And did eat up every herb in their land, \n         And did eat up the fruit of their ground. \n      He smote also all the first-born in their land, \n        The chief of all their strength. \n\n     \"And He brought them forth with silver and gold; \n        And there was not one feeble person among His tribes. \n      Egypt was glad when they departed; \n        For the fear of them had fallen upon them. \n                                                                           109\n\n     \"He spread a cloud for a covering, \n        And fire to give light in the night. \n      They asked, and He brought quails, \n        And satisfied them with the bread of heaven. \n      He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; \n        They ran in the dry places like a river. \n\n     \"For He remembered His holy word, \n        And Abraham His servant. \n      And He brought forth His people with joy, \n        And His chosen with singing. \n      And He gave them the lands of the nations; \n        And they took the labor of the peoples in possession: \n      That they might keep His statutes, \n        And observe His laws. \n              \"Praise ye Jehovah.\"     Psalm 105, A. R. V. \n\n                                               -\n\n\n                    A Hymn Of The Captivity \n\n\n                         \"Praise ye Jehovah. \n\n\n     \"Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for He is good; \n        For His loving-kindness endureth forever. \n      Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, \n        Or show forth all His praise? \n      Blessed are they that keep justice, \n        And he that doeth righteousness at all times. \n      Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that Thou bearest \n            unto Thy people; \n      Oh visit me with Thy salvation, \n      That I may see the prosperity of Thy chosen, \n      That I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation, \n      That I may glory with Thine inheritance. \n\n                                     I \n\n             \"We have sinned with our fathers, \n              We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. \n              Our fathers understood not Thy wonders in Egypt; \n              They remembered not the multitude of Thy \n               loving-kindnesses. \n              But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. \n                                                                           110\n\n     \"Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, \n      That He might make His mighty power to be known. \n      He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: \n      So He led them through the depths, as  through a wilderness. \n      And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, \n      And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. \n      And the waters covered their adversaries; \n      There was not one of them left. \n      Then believed they His words; \n      They sang His praise. \n\n                                II \n\n              \"They soon forgat His works; \n               They waited not for His counsel, \n               But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, \n               And tempted God in the desert. \n               And He gave them their request, \n               But sent leanness into their soul. \n               They envied Moses also in the camp, \n               And Aaron the saint of Jehovah. \n               The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, \n               And covered the company of Abiram. \n               And a fire was kindled in their company \n               The flame burned up the wicked. \n               They made a calf in Horeb, \n               And worshiped a molten image. \n               Thus they changed their glory \n               For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. \n\n     \"They forgot God their Saviour, \n      Who had done great things in Egypt, \n      Wondrous works in the land of Ham, \n      And terrible things by the Red Sea. \n      Therefore He said that He would destroy them, \n      Had not  Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, \n      To turn away His wrath, lest He should destroy them. \n\n                                III \n\n              \"Yea, they despised the pleasant land, \n               They believed not His word, \n               But murmured in their tents, \n               And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah. \n               Therefore He sware unto them, \n                                                                           111\n\n               That He would overthrow them in the wilderness, \n               And that He would overthrow their seed among the \n                     nations, \n               And scatter them in the lands. \n               They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, \n               And ate the sacrifices of the dead. \n               Thus they provoked Him to anger with their doings; \n               And the plague brake in upon them. \n\n     \"Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; \n      And so the plague was stayed. \n      And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, \n      Unto all generations for evermore. \n\n                                 IV \n\n              \"They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, \n               So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes; \n               Because they were rebellious against his spirit, \n               And he spake unadvisedly with his lips. \n               They did not destroy the peoples, \n               As Jehovah commanded them, \n               But mingled themselves with the nations, \n               And learned their works, \n               And served their idols, \n               Which became a snare unto them. \n               Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters \n                      unto demons, \n               And shed innocent blood, \n               Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, \n               Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; \n               And the land was polluted with blood. \n               Thus were they defiled with their works, \n               And played the harlot in their doings. \n\n     \"Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against His \n            people, \n      And He abhorred His inheritance. \n      And He gave them into the hand of the nations; \n      And they that hated them ruled over them. \n      Their enemies also oppressed them, \n      And they were brought into subjection under their hand. \n      Many times did He deliver them; \n      But they were rebellious in their counsel, \n      And were brought low in their iniquity. \n                                                                           112\n\n     \"Nevertheless He regarded their distress, \n      When He heard their cry: \n      And He remembered for them His covenant, \n      And repented according to the multitude of His \n           loving-kindnesses. \n      He made them also to be pitied \n      Of all those that carried them captive. \n\n     \"Save us, O Jehovah our God, \n        And gather us from among the nations, \n      To give thanks unto Thy holy name, \n        And to triumph in Thy praise. \n\n     \"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, \n      From everlasting even to everlasting. \n      And let all the people say, Amen. \n               \"Praise ye Jehovah.\" Psalm 106, A.
