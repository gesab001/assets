    "word": "God is willing to do much for you, if you will only feel your need of him. Jesus loves you. Ever seek to walk in the light of God's wisdom; and through all the changing scenes of life, do not rest unless you know that your will is in harmony with the will of your Creator. Through faith in him you may obtain strength to resist every temptation of Satan, and thus increase in moral power with every proving from God.",
