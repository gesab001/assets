    "word": "I am sorry that Brother Rice has felt called upon to call the attention of other minds to the words and exercises of this sister. I will say no more at present on this subject, only this: I have been shown many who will claim to be especially taught of God, and will attempt to lead others, and from mistaken ideas of duty they will undertake a work that God has never laid upon them. Confusion will be the result. Let everyone seek God most earnestly for himself that he may individually understand His will. Elder Rice, my dear brother, if you will only heed the words of caution given you of God to speak short, right to the point, to pray short and right to the point, and bring to a period your remarks, you would have saved yourself \n\n\n                                  -183- \n\nmuch suffering, and accomplished more good. You have precious thought which you can readily communicate, but you have taxed the vital organs to your injury. I hope you have not gone too far for recovery.",
