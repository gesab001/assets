    "word": "After Adam and Eve had yielded to the tempter, the covering of light, their garment of innocence, was taken from them. \"The eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.\" In the past they had been glad to see their Creator when He came to walk and talk with them. Now in their sinfulness they were afraid to meet Him. Hearing the voice of God in the garden, they \"hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou; and he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked and hid myself.\" \"Who told thee that thou wast naked?\" God asked. \"Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\" Then Adam did that which it is natural for all human beings to do. He threw the blame on someone else. \"The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,\" he said, \"she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\" (See Genesis 3:7-12). \n\n\n                                    -320-",
