    "word": "I am in Australia, and I believe that I am just where the Lord wants me to be.  Because suffering is my portion, I have no thought of beating a retreat.  The blessed assurance is given me that Jesus is mine and that I am His child.  The darkness is dispelled by the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness.  Who can understand the pain I suffer but the One who is afflicted in all our afflictions?  To whom can I speak but to Him who is touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and who knows how to succor those who are tempted?",
