    "word": "I love the Lord because He first loved me. I praise my heavenly Father that I can know that Christ is by my side at all times, for His promise is, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Think you there is anything in this world that tempts me to go astray from the Word of God? Oh, no! I have so firm a faith in Jesus Christ that I am looking forward to the time when I shall behold the King in His beauty, and see His matchless charms. Soon the gates of the city of God will be thrown back upon their glittering hinges, and the nations that have kept the truth will enter in and hear the words, \"Well done, good and faithful servants, enter ye unto the joy of your Lord.\" Touching their golden harps, they will fill all heaven with rich music and with songs to the Lamb.",
