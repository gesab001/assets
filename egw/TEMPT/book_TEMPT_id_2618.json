    "word": "The moral dangers to which all, both old and young, are exposed are daily increasing. . . . Satan is making masterly efforts to involve married men and women and children and youth in impure practices. His temptations find acceptance in many hearts, because they have not been elevated, purified, refined, and ennobled by the sacred truth which they claim to believe. Not a few have been low and vile in thought and common in talk and deportment, so that when Satan's temptations come they have no moral power to resist them and fall an easy prey. . . .",
