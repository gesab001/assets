    "word": "Adam and Eve became sinners because of transgression, and now the Lord has given to the world His only begotten Son. That He might abolish the law? That law that Adam transgressed?

Satan says, \"Ye shall not die.\" God says, \"If ye eat of it ye shall die.\" Whom shall we believe? \n\n\n                                   -228-",
