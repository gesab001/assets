    "word": "\"Whatever ye ask the Father in My name believing,\" Christ says, \"ye shall receive.\" Money is of value only as it is used as the Lord's entrusted means [only] if, as the Lord's stewards we hold it in trust as a precious gift of heaven with which we can bless humanity. But if it is used to indulge and glorify self, it is a curse and an encumbrance and a constant temptation. It becomes a stumbling block over which thousands of souls fall into temptation and all manner of iniquity.",
