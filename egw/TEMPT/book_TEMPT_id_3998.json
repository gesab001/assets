    "word": "The experience of the disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane contains a lesson for the Lord\u2019s people today. . . . They did not realize the necessity of watchfulness and earnest prayer in order to withstand temptation. Many today are fast asleep, as were the disciples. They are not watching and praying lest they enter into temptation. Let us often read and give careful study to those portions of God\u2019s Word that have special reference to these last days, pointing out the dangers that will threaten God\u2019s people.\u2014(In Heavenly Places, 97.)",
