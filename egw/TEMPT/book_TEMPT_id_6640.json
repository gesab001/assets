    "word": "No youth can withstand the temptations of Satan if the truth, with its purifying, uplifting power, is not abiding in the heart. Truth has a correcting influence upon the life. It is a divine sentinel, keeping watch in your souls and rousing to action against Satan's assaults. Under the divine influence of truth the mind will be strengthened, the intellect invigorated, and there will be a growing up in the knowledge of the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. Do not tarnish the truth by indulging in habits and practices that are inconsistent with its holy character, but hold it as a treasure of highest value. . . .",
