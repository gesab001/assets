    "word": "PRAYER ENABLES US TO LIVE IN THE SUNSHINE OF HIS PRESENCE.\u2014It is our privilege to open our hearts, and let the sunshine of Christ\u2019s\n10\npresence in. My brother, my sister, face the light. Come into actual, personal contact with Christ, that you may exert an influence that is uplifting and reviving. Let your faith be strong and pure and steadfast. Let gratitude to God fill your hearts. When you rise in the morning, kneel at your bedside, and ask God to give you strength to fulfil the duties of the day, and to meet its temptations. Ask Him to help you to bring into your work Christ\u2019s sweetness of character. Ask Him to help you to speak words that will inspire those around you with hope and courage, and draw you nearer to the Saviour.\u2014(Sons and Daughters of God, 199.)",
