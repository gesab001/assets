    "word": "It is your duty to be more easy, quiet and be contented to do what little good you can as providence opens the way for you. You are constantly trying to open some way for yourself and if you continue to plan and make so large calculations you will greatly burden your brethren, exhaust their patience and Satan will tempt you. Individuals will present inducements to you and represent that this people do not appreciate your talents, etc. You will be tempted to break away from this people where you can be pushed forward to do more. But Bro. Czechowski, I was shown that if individuals \n\n\n                                    -73- \n\ncould obtain their object and cause you to leave this people and carry out their plans, their interest in you would soon die. Without God you could accomplish nothing, and they would be disappointed in you and would have no further care for your family.",
