    "word": "We have access to God through the merits of the name of Christ, and God invites us to bring to Him our trials and temptations; for He understands them all. He would not have us pour out our woes to human ears. Through the blood of Christ we may come to the throne of grace and find grace to help in time of need. We may come with assurance, saying, \"My acceptance is in the Beloved.\" \"For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.\" \"In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him\" (Ephesians 2:18; 3:12).",
