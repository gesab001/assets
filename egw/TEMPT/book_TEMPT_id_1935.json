    "word": "Those who go to Battle Creek meet with temptations that they did not suppose could exist in that place. They meet with discouragements which they need not have had, and they are not helped in their religious experience by going to that place. They lose much time because they know not what they are to do, and no one is prepared to tell them. They lose much time in following occupations which have no bearing upon the work for which they desire to fit themselves. The common and the sacred work are co-mingled, and stand on a level. But this is not a wise policy. God looks on and does not approve. Many things might have been done that would have had lasting influence, had they worked moderately and in humility in the place where they were. Time is passing; souls are deciding either for evil or good, and the warfare is constantly increasing. How many who know the truth for this time are working in harmony with its principles? It is true that something is being done; but more, far more, should have been done. The work is accumulating, and the time for doing the work is diminishing. It is now time for all to be burning and shining lights; and yet many are failing to keep their lamps supplied with the oil of grace, and trimmed and burning so that light may gleam out today.",
