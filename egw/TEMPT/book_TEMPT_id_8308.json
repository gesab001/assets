    "word": "God looks with contempt upon the large assemblies at the Battle Creek Tabernacle, while the hearts of those present are lifted up unto vanity. Their numbers displease Him. Is there not a world to be warned? Why then are there those assembled in the Tabernacle whose hearts swell with vanity because of their large assembly and their music. Let there be a humiliation of soul before God, that He may remove the discipline He has placed upon His people because they have departed from God.",
