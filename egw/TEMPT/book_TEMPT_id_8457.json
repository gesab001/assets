    "word": "William Gage will do the very work I have described. He has never known the experience you have had. He has never had the sweet connection with God you have had. He has moved by impulse, not by principle, not from deep, earnest conviction. He has had no power to resist temptation. He knows nothing by experience of what it is to walk with God. The Lord reads this poor, deceived soul as an open book, and he wants you to withdraw from him; separate your interest from him, for it is corrupting to your faith. I want you [to] come off victorious.",
