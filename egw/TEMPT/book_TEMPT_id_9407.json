    "word": "Be Helpers \n\n     Students, never be found disparaging the schools which God has established. If you have failed at any time, if you have fallen under temptation, it was because you did not make God your strength, because you did not have that faith that works by love and purifies the soul. If you had felt that as human agents for whom Christ has given His precious life, it was your privilege to do all you possibly could to aid the work God has recognized as His work, if you had called into existence every ability in an effort to co-operate with Christ in blessing and saving the youth, you would have made great advance upward and onward. When each student in our institutions of learning acts his part with fidelity, as Daniel acted his part in wicked Babylon, these institutions will resemble the schools of the prophets. No wrong influence will then go from the students. As consecrated instrumentalities, they will help to do the work they see necessary to be done. They will help to carry the burdens borne by the president and the teachers, and instead of disparaging the school, they will speak of the excellence and personal merit of the teachers.",
