    "word": "When Christ sent out His disciples, He sent them out two and two, and commanded them saying, \"Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into every city of the Samaritans, enter ye not, But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" Why was this restriction made? This was their first trial, the first time that they should attempt to labor (453) without the personal presence of their Lord. They were not to go into the way of these caviling religionists who would draw them into controversy. \"Go rather unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, Cast out devils; freely ye have received, freely give.\" Matthew 10:10, 17.",
