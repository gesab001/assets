    "word": "Bro. and sister Hale, of Maine, were also injured by receiving undue attention from Bro. Andrews. They became jealous of my husband, myself, and other brethren and sisters, because they did not receive as much attention from them. Bro. and sister Hale were a great trial to the church. They were most of the time on the contrary side, seldom in union with the church. They could seldom be found twice of the same mind. They had a way and will of their own, which they wished others to follow; but they were not willing to be led. They were both independent, willful, set, and unyielding. They had their points to carry, and were unwilling to submit their will and judgment to that of the church. Here Bro. Andrews failed, both in discernment and judgment. He thought to pacify and to please Bro. and sister \n                                                                           69\nHale, and remove all occasion for jealousy. His precious time and strength were taxed in this effort which only did injury. Faithful dealing, mingled with kindness, would have been exactly what they needed. The undue interest Bro. Andrews manifested for them was like daubing them with untempered mortar. Plain truth, appropriate to their condition, spoken to them, would have been like laying the ax at the root of the tree. The attention Bro. Andrews gave them led them to expect the same consideration from their brethren; and if they were not flattered, their jealousy was excited. They thought their brethren did not appreciate them, and that they were very essential to the church. They thought their judgment should be respected above the judgment of the brethren. They would not have been placed in this position of temptation, if it had not been for the special and uncalled for attention of Bro. Andrews.",
