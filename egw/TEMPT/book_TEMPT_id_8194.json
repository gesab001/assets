    "word": "MR No. 593 - The Investigative Judgment\n\n     God sees many temptations resisted of which the world, and even near friends, never know; temptations in the home, in the heart; He sees the soul's humility in view of its own weakness, the sincere repentance over even a thought that is evil; He sees the whole heart's devotion to the upbuilding of the cause of God, without one tinge of selfishness; He has noted those hours of hard battle with self, battles that won the victory--all this God and angels know.--Letter 18, 1891, p. 4. (To Brother Irwin, June 29, 1891.)",
