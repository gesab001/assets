    "word": "Christ\u2019s mission could be fulfilled only through suffering. Before Him was a life of sorrow, hardship, and conflict, and an ignominious death. But now Christ might deliver Himself from the dreadful future by acknowledging the supremacy of Satan. But to do this was to yield the victory in the great controversy. Christ declared to the tempter, \u201cGet thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\u201d Christ\u2019s divinity flashed through suffering humanity. Satan had no power to resist the command to depart. Humiliated and enraged, he was forced to withdraw from the presence of the world\u2019s Redeemer.\u2014Manuscript 155, 1902 (Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, pp. 218, 219).",
