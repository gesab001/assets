    "word": "God prohibited the use of wine to the priests ministering in His sanctuary, and the same injunction would have been made against tobacco, had its use been known; for it, too, has a benumbing influence upon the brain. And besides clouding the mind, it is unclean and defiling. Let every one resist the temptation to use wine, tobacco, flesh-meats, tea, or coffee. Experience has demonstrated that far better work can be accomplished without these harmful things.",
