    "word": "Not only the human, but the brute creation are made to suffer through Satan's attributes wrought out through the human agent. One human being becomes Satan's co-partner to tempt, allure, and deceive his fellow-men by vicious practices. And the sure result is diseased bodies, because of the violation of moral law; \"Because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold.\" It is Satan's determined purpose to deceive the human family to such an extent that he can bring them as a mass on his side to work with him in making man believe that the law of God is no longer obligatory upon the human race. Then he will find agencies which will multiply his efficiency in leading man to ignore the law of God. When they do this, then he rules them with a rod of iron.",
