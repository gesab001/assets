    "word": "I feel so sorry for those who are being misled in their Christian experience, because they do not need to be. God is true. He says, \"My grace is sufficient.\" God is faithful, who will not suffer any soul to be tempted above that he is able. God weighs every trial before He permits it to be allotted. He knows every circumstance, and He will give the light essential to resist temptation, unless the one tempted refuses to discern the truth because he does not wish to know. Then God leaves him to his own choice. If he chooses the darkness, he will have it. Every time he yields to Satan's dictation, in order to maintain his own objectionable dignity, he is placed where he does not choose to know and to understand the truth. It is not God's way that he wants, but his own way, for God's way would not glorify self.--Letter 86, 1906, pp. 1, 2, 4. (To George I. Butler, from Sanitarium, California, March 8, 1906.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 25, 1981",
