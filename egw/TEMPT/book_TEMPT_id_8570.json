    "word": "All heaven rejoiced because humanity, the workmanship of God, was placed in an elevated scale with God by the signal victory gained. Christ was more than conqueror, leaving the way open that man may be more than conqueror through Christ's merits, because He loved him. The Son of the infinite God is brought into the tenderest sympathies with the tempted church. He knows how to succor those who shall be tempted, because He was Himself tempted.--Ms 57, 1890. (Transcribed from Diary Book No. 14, pp. 272-283; 293-295.) \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. September 2, 1986. Entire Manuscript.",
