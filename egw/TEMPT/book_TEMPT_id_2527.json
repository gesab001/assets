    "word": "I am convinced that we lose much by forgetting Jesus when we travel. We cannot, while upon the cars or boats, enter our closets and there be alone with God; but we can gird up the loins of the mind, and uplift our hearts to him in silent prayer for grace to keep our thoughts stayed upon him; and he will surely hear us. There will be temptations to let our thoughts and words flow in the same channel with those of the worldlings around us; but it should be kept in mind that \u201cin the multitude of words there wanteth not sin.\u201d Those who are Christians will profess Christ in their choice conversation, in their sobriety, and in their deportment wherever they are.",
