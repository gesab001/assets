    "word": "The tempter presents matters in such a very seducing way that men love the presentation. Satan says, as he did to Adam and Eve, \"Ye shall be as gods,\" and the poor souls come under Satan's mesmeric influence, and they are among the number of those who depart from the faith and begin to weave them beautiful allurements to charm the senses. They love and adore nature, talk science, and all is a fine gossamer picture, pleasing to the fancy of the worldly but an abomination in the sight of the Lord. Each heart has its own idol unless that heart is cleansed. It loves, adores, and worships the beautiful theories spun, but there is death in these things.",
