    "word": "Many know very little of God's dealings with His people, but the most hopeless part of their experience is that they do not try to understand His dealings in these precious hours of probation. It is their privilege to know that His afflictions come for the object of purifying them from all evil. The Lord permits trials to come in order that we may look to Him as the source of our strength, and be cleansed from earthliness, from selfishness, from harshness, from sharp unchristlike traits of character. He suffers the deep waters of \n\n\n                                     -270- \n\naffliction to go over our souls in order that we may know Him and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent, in order that we may have deep heart-longings to be cleansed from defilement, and to come forth from the trial purer, holier, and happier. We enter the furnace of trial with our souls darkened with selfishness, and if patient under the crucial test, we shall come forth reflecting the divine character. The Lord is able to deliver the godly out of temptation.",
