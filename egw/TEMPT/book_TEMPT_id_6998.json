    "word": "You are not working alone. When you are tempted to become discouraged, remember this: Angels of God are right around you. They will minister to the very earth, causing it to give forth its treasures. This is the instruction I am trying to give to our people. I want them to understand what could be accomplished, if they would work the will of the Lord. It is the Lord who has given the instruction. Let us follow His directions.--Manuscript 13, April 26, 1909, \"To the Workers and Students at Hill Crest School.\"",
