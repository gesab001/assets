    "word": "Jesus loves you, dear children. You are His little flock. He wants each one of you to form a beautiful character. There will always be temptations coming to you individually to cherish and strengthen by indulgence the weak, defective element in your characters. You may never again have as precious an opportunity of being associated as you are now. So you should seek to be very kind to one another, to be thoughtful of your words and actions, lest you sow in one another's hearts seeds which will become tares, thistles, and other obnoxious plants. These words will not only grieve the hearts of one another, but they will grieve the heart of Jesus Christ. Let not the enemy sow the seeds of envy, of fretting, of complaining, or of thinking evil one of another. A seed of jealousy is ready to spring into life at any moment, and will endeavor to gain the mastery.",
