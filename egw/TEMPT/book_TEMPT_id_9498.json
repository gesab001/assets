    "word": "At too many tables, when the stomach has received all that it requires \n\n                                   -42- \n\nto properly carry on its work of nourishing the system, another course, consisting of pies, puddings, and highly flavored sauces, is placed upon the table. Society has sought out many inventions and she has decreed that the food be placed upon the table in different courses. Not knowing what is coming next, one may partake of a sufficiency of food which perhaps is not the most suited to him. Then the last course is brought on. This may be composed of articles of food which, if they had been placed on the table at the first, would have added much to his enjoyment of the food. Many, though they have already eaten enough, will overstep the bounds, and eat the tempting dessert, which, however, proves anything but good to them.",
