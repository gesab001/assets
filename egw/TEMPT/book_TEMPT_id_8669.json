    "word": "Satan sought to tempt Christ not only to indulge the grosser passions and to yield to appetite, but he appealed to His ambition. Notwithstanding the enemy's determined efforts, Christ did not manifest a grasping spirit to gain possession of the kingdoms of this world. He did not worship Satan to gain worldly wealth. Integrity should never be yielded to obtain any earthly advantage. Power and riches obtained at the expense of honesty and principle will prove a terrible curse. Yet the masses worship Satan instead of God, because such a course gives them more freedom to engage in satanic practices in their business transactions, that they may add to their riches.",
