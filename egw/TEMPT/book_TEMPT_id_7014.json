    "word": "Christ, the Majesty of heaven, came to this earth in human flesh, expressing divine benevolence, sympathy, and love for the fallen race as He stood at the head of the human family. He came to redeem sinners and clothe them with His righteousness. As the Saviour of the world, He was subject to temptations. The enemy assailed Him on every point. Constantly he came to Him with the suggestion that by compromising with the world, He might win the world. Christ is our example. . . . [Although] He was in the world, He was not of the world. He was not to conform to worldly practices in order to reach the object of His life. He was not to please Himself. The highest standard must be maintained. Deviation from strict moral rectitude would mar His whole lifework.",
