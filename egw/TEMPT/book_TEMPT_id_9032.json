    "word": "God's people are tempted and tried because they cannot see the spirit of self-sacrifice and consecration to God in all who manage important interests, and many act as though Jesus were buried in Joseph's new tomb and a great stone rolled before the door. I wish to proclaim with voice and pen, Jesus has risen; He has risen; He is a living Saviour, the head of the church. He is the Good Shepherd. \"The sheep follow Him: for they know His voice. And a stranger will they not follow\" [John 10:4].",
