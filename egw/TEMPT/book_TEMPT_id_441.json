    "word": "Christ went into the wilderness of temptation to bear the severest temptations, He was tempted in all points as Adam was tempted, and He passed over the very ground where Adam stumbled and fell. . . . Christ was now to stand where Adam stood, bearing humanity and overcoming in behalf of the race where Adam fell. And Christ withstood the test on every point; He resisted on the point of appetite. . . . He was tempted upon the point of ambition, and presumption, and He overcame the enemy on these points. . . . The Saviour of the world overcame and obtained the victory on every point.\u2014Manuscript 11, 1886.",
