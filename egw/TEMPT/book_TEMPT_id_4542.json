    "word": "Testimonies Our Protection \n\n     I urged our brethren to become acquainted with the teachings that are in the Testimonies. God has given us light that we cannot disregard or treat with indifference or contempt. He has let light shine upon us in reproofs, in warnings, that we may, if we will, take hold upon it and escape the dangers that beset our pathway. When temptations arise, we may be guarded and we may discern them because the Lord has pointed them out to us, that we shall not be deceived.--Manuscript 23, 1889.",
