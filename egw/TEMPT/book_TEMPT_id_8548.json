    "word": "All heaven watched the scene of the temptation. The object of Satan's assault was the Commander of heaven, and with what intense interest heavenly angels watched the conflict. Behold, angels stand on guard, ready to undertake in Christ's behalf should Satan pass his prescribed limit. Oh, what love burns in the hearts of the angelic throng as they behold their loved Commander apparently in the power of His foe. And when the last temptation comes, when the enemy offers to Christ all the world and the glory of it if He will fall down and worship him, when they see divinity flash through humanity, their love and sympathy can no longer be restrained.",
