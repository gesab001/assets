    "word": "Diligently Teach.--Teach your children from the cradle to practice self-denial and self-control. . . . Impress upon their tender minds the truth that God does not design that we should live for present gratification merely, but for our ultimate good. Teach them that to yield to temptation is weak and wicked; to resist, noble and manly. These lessons will be as seed sown in good soil, and they will bear fruit that will make your hearts glad.--The Ministry of Healing, page 386.",
