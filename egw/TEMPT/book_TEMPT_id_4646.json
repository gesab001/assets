    "word": "Satan Spoke Through Peter.--When Christ revealed to Peter the time of trial and suffering that was just before Him, and Peter replied, \"Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee,\" the Saviour commanded, \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\" Satan was speaking through Peter, making him act the part of the tempter. Satan's presence was unsuspected by Peter, but Christ could detect the presence of the deceiver, and in His rebuke to Peter He addressed the real foe (Letter 244, 1907).",
