    "word": "\"Judas saith unto Him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the world? Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and we will come unto him\" [verses 22, 23]. Ever keep this promise in mind, and when the enemy tempts you to doubt, say No. Now, is there any excuse for not perfecting Christian character? I do not see any excuse.",
