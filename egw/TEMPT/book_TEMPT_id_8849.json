    "word": "We cannot be overcome while we place our whole dependence upon God, and stand firm in His strength. When we are tempted, we must humble ourselves. We must keep back the words of argument with which we think that we could baffle the enemy. What we desire to say might be perfectly true, but God does not wish His people to controvert Satan's suggestions. Let them take their stand on the platform of eternal truth, and let their only weapon be the word, \"It is written.\" This will bring more confusion to him than any charge that we ourselves could make against him. He has used the word of God frequently to the heavenly assemblies. God's words stand fast forever. They cannot be changed.",
