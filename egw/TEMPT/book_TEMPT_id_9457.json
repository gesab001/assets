    "word": "\"Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness\" - now there is where our lack is.

Now everyone will have the Holy Spirit of God upon them if they will seek for it in the right way, if they will \n\n180. \n\ncome to him as little children, and if they will ask him for his Grace and his power and his salvation that they can be lifted up? - No, that isn't it. But that they may have all these advantages to present to be a blessing to those that are around them. What we want is to study the Bible and to find out the way that may take hold of the promises of God and claim them as ours. And we will be happy in that.
