    "word": "My brother, you need to be converted, and to become as a little child.  You should be fearful of following your own judgment.  Should you in any way become suspicious of one who does not harmonize with you, you would make trouble.  When your will and way is crossed, bitter feelings arise in your heart.  You cherish a feeling of hatred toward the one whom you think has made a mistake.  You forget that when a brother has made a mistake, you should \"seek to restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.\" We are out of place in cherishing bitter feelings toward any of the Lord's purchased possession.--Letter 285, 1905, pp. 2, 3 (Oct. 2, 1905, to Dr. Wade).",
