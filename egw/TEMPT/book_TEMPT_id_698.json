    "word": "In the battle with inward corruption and outward temptation, even the wise and powerful Solomon was vanquished. His life began under favorable auspices. He was beloved of God; and, had virtue been preserved, his life might have closed in prosperity and honor. But he surrendered this special grace to lustful passion. In his youth he trusted in God, and looked to him for guidance; and the Lord gave him power and wisdom that astonished the world. His fame reached to all lands. But when he began to descend the declivity of life, he yielded principle, thus placing himself in the current of evil, and separating himself from God, the foundation and source of his strength; he lost his firmness of character, and wavered, like a giddy youth, between right and wrong. His love of women was his sin. This passion he did not control in his manhood, and it proved a snare to him. He took many wives, some of whom were daughters of heathen kings; and they led him into idolatry. In his youth, wisdom had been more precious to him than the golden wedge of Ophir. But, alas! lustful passions gained the victory. He was \n129\ndeceived and ruined by women. What a lesson is here taught! What a demonstration of the need of strength from God to the very last! It is not safe to permit the least departure from strict integrity.",
