When the angel had gone, he called \u201ctwo of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.\u201d . . .

In His wisdom the Lord brings those who are seeking for truth into touch with fellow beings who know the truth.\u2014RH April 6, 1911.",
