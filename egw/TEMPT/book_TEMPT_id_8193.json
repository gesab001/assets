    "word": "Again we look at the life of Christ. He was poor, and suffered hunger and fatigue. He was tempted by a vile foe, and His path was made rough and obstructed with difficulties and obstacles. The Pharisees and Sadducees had one bond of union, which was opposition to Christ. They not only refused to receive His testimony themselves, but they perverted His testimony and sought to ensnare Him in His words by subtle questions. They called Him a winebibber because He sought to reach men where they were by eating at their tables. For His condescending love and great mercy He was the more hated by those who wished to destroy His influence. Because He claimed His oneness with the Father, they charged Him with blasphemy and madness. \n\n\n                                    -242-",
