    "word": "O what a scene of rejoicing it will be when the Lamb of God shall place upon the heads of the redeemed the victor's crown! Never, never more will you be led into temptation and sin. You will see the King in His beauty. And those whom you have helped heavenward will meet you there. They will throw their arms about you and acknowledge what you have done for them. \"You watched over me,\" they will say; \"you prayed for me; you helped me to gain heaven.\" . . .",
