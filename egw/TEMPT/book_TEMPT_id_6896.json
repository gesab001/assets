    "word": "The angels warned them to be on their guard against the devices of Satan; for his efforts to ensnare them would\n52\nbe unwearied. While they were obedient to God, the evil one could not harm them; for, if need be, every angel in heaven would be sent to their help. If they steadfastly repelled his first insinuations, they would be as secure as the heavenly messengers. But should they once yield to temptation, their nature would become so depraved that in themselves they would have no power, and no disposition, to resist Satan.\u2014PP 52, 53.",
