    "word": "Judas was chosen as one of Christ's disciples. Christ did not reject him because he was not perfect. Judas had the power to heal the sick and to cure diseases, but the lesson to be taught every one that is a church member is that having their names registered on the church books will never make them Christians. It is doing the Word that makes us sons and daughters of God. Judas, notwithstanding the lessons of Christ, failed to be converted daily, to be an instrument sanctified and polished for the Master's use; he became subject to temptation. His old hereditary and natural tendencies Satan found could be used to dishonor the Master and imperil his own soul.",
