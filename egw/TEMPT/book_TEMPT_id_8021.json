    "word": "As you learn how to care for the sick, and how to conform to the laws that will preserve the body in health, carry out the instruction you receive. Remember that you are not to yield to the temptations of appetite, or in any way defile or mar the body that God desires for the habitation of His Spirit. By a conscientious care of your health, show your appreciation of the price that Christ has paid for you.--Ms 8, 1905, pp. 3, 4. (\"Growing in Grace,\" September 23, 1904.)--Released May 14, 1970.",
