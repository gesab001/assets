    "word": "Chap. 18 - No Complicated Reasoning nor Argument\n\n     Right to the Point--Christ seldom attempted to prove that truth is truth. He illustrated truth in all its bearings, and then left His hearers free to accept or reject it, as they might choose. He did not force anyone to believe.

The power manifested by the disciples was revealed in the clearness and earnestness with which they expressed the truth.",
