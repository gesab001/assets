    "word": "MR No. 937 - To the Leaders in Our Medical Work\n\n     Dear Brethren: I have a message for you. I am instructed to say that all the arrangements connected with the management of the medical-missionary work are not to originate in Battle Creek. It is the deceptive power of the enemy of all righteousness that leads to the repeated attempts to bring all our medical institutions under the control of one organization. Certainly such efforts are not inspired by the Lord. The medical-missionary work is God's work, and in every conference and church we are to take a decided stand against allowing it to be controlled by men.",
