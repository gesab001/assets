    "word": "The history of Daniel and his companions has been recorded on the pages of the inspired word for the benefit of the youth of all succeeding ages. Those who would preserve their powers unimpaired for the Service of God must observe strict temperance in the use of all his bounties, as well as total abstinence from every injurious or debasing indulgence. What men have done, men may do. Did those faithful Hebrews stand firm amid great temptation, and bear a noble testimony in favor of true temperance? The youth of today may bear a similar testimony, even under circumstances as unfavorable. Would that they would emulate the example of those Hebrew youth; for all who will, may, like them, enjoy the favor and blessing of God.",
