    "word": "Do not think that the Christian life is free from temptation. Temptations will come to every Christian. Both the Christian and the one who does not accept Christ as his leader will have trials. The difference is that the latter is serving a tyrant, doing his mean drudgery, while the Christian is serving the One who died to give him eternal life. Do not look upon trial \n161\nas something strange, but as the means by which we are to be purified and strengthened. \u201cCount it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations,\u201d James admonishes; \u201cknowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience\u201d (James 1:2, 3).",
