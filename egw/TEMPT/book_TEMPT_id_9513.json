    "word": "There is no picture presented before our imagination of a sorrowful shepherd returning without the sheep. And the Lord Jesus declares the pleasure of the shepherd, and his joy in finding the sheep causes pleasure and rejoicing in heaven among the angels. Then when the children and youth stray from the fold, do not give them up, do not expel them from school. Do not show that you want to humiliate them; but with tender voice and yearning love seek them, knowing that all heaven is enlisted with you in the work of bringing them back to the fold. The Lord has presented these lessons for you who are educators. He has such a living interest for each separate child of his redeemed that he has not left them to be exposed and perish in the wilderness of temptation, because you drove them there for Satan to work his cruel will upon them. The wisdom of God, his power and his love, are without a parallel. It is the divine guarantee that not one even of the straying sheep and lambs is overlooked, and not one left unsuccored. A golden chain, the mercy and compassion of divine power, is passed around every one of these imperiled souls. Then shall not the human agent cooperate with God. Shall he be sinful, failing, defective in character himself, regardless of the soul ready to perish? Christ has linked him to his eternal throne by offering his own life.",
