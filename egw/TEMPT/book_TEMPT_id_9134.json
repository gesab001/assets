    "word": "Brother Butler wrote me a letter of a most singular purport, and made wonderfully strong statements in it. He called these men whom God has appointed to do a special work in His cause fledglings. He moreover said that he had received letters from Northern and Central California, saying that they would not send their children to the college if the views of E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones were brought in. Well, I will not attempt to tell you all about this matter; but I learned that you were one who wrote letters of warning to Elder Butler. I asked him if I might see the letter, but he said that he had destroyed it. Strange proceedings! My brother, Is the Lord leading you? or is the enemy working upon your mind as upon the minds of others? I have come to the conclusion that this is the case. I have not changed my views in reference to the law in Galatians, but I hope that I shall never be left to entertain the spirit that was brought into the General Conference.

Will it totter and fall if criticized? If so, let if fall, the sooner the better. The spirit that would close the door to investigation of points of truth in a Christlike manner is not the Spirit from above.",
