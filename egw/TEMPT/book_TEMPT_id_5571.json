    "word": "It was pride of heart which led these brethren to manifest so much fear lest others should know that they had been corrected. If they had humbly confessed their wrongs to the church, they would have acted out the faith they professed to have in the visions, and the church would have been strengthened to receive correction and confess their faults. These teachers stood in the way of the flock. They set them a wrong example, and the church have looked to them, and when reproved have inquired: \"Why have not these ministers been reproved, when we are following their teachings?\" A door has thus been opened for Satan to tempt them as to the truthfulness of the visions.",
