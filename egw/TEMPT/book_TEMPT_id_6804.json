    "word": "\"Seek.\" Desire not merely His blessing, but Himself. \"Acquaint now thyself with Him, and be at peace.\" Job 22:21. Seek, and you shall find. God is seeking you, and the very desire you feel to come to Him is but the drawing of His Spirit. Yield to that drawing. Christ is pleading the cause of the tempted, the erring, and the faithless. He is seeking to lift them into companionship with Himself. \"If thou seek Him, He will be found of thee.\" 1 Chronicles 28:9.",
