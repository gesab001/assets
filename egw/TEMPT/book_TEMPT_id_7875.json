    "word": "Those who claim to be Christ's followers pledge themselves to obedience at the time of their baptism. When they go down into the water, they pledge themselves in the presence of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost that they will henceforth be dead unto the world and its temptations, and that they will arise from the watery grave to walk, in newness of life, even a life of obedience to God's requirements. The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Colossians, reminded them of their baptismal pledge, and wrote: \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God\" (Colossians 3:1-3). How much better it is to seek those things which are above, than to seek the things of this world, and to form our characters after a worldly similitude!",
