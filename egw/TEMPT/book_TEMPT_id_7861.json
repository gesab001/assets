    "word": "Let none entertain the thought, however, that we can dispense with organization. It has cost us much study and many prayers for wisdom that we know God has answered, to erect this structure. It has been built up by His direction, through much sacrifice and conflict.

In the name of the Lord I declare to you that it is to stand, strengthened, established, and settled. Letter 32, 1892, pp. 1, 10-12. (To the Brethren of the General Conference, December 19, 1892.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D.C.",
