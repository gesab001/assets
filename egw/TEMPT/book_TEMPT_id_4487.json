    "word": "Dared Not Doubt.--In the confusion I was sometimes tempted to doubt my own experience. While at family prayers one morning, the power of God began to rest upon me, and the thought rushed into my mind that it was mesmerism, and I resisted it. Immediately I was struck dumb. . . . After that I dared not doubt or for a moment resist the power of God, however others might think of me.--Early Writings, pp. 22, 23.",
