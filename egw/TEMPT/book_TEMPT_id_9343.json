    "word": "What reason had Christ given them for making this statement? None at all. The Prince of life was seeking the lost sheep. At last the leaders of Israel put Him to death. What had He done?

By it a fountain (269) of mercy was opened to a world yet to be convinced of the wonderful sacrifice made in order that whoever believed in Christ should not perish, but have everlasting life. The preaching of the gospel gives sinners opportunity to receive the greatest gift ever proffered human beings. Those who refuse this gift reveal the highest contempt for God.",
