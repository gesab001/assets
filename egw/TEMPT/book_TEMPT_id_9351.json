Reaser and the Ministers in Southern Calif.: \n\nDear Brother Reaser:- \n     The Lord has revealed to me that in your work as president of the Southern Calif. conference, you are in danger of embracing too much responsibility. Some time ago the Lord showed me that if you were placed in office, you would attempt to rule in every branch of the work, but that this was not to be permitted, because you have not the judgment to deal with all lines of work and because God has chosen especially qualified workers for certain lines of His work.",
