    "word": "But when prosperity comes to the human agent, does he give glory to God? Does he honor God with thanksgiving? Does it increase his faith and love to God and his fellow men, or does he trust in his riches and expect to be favored and honored for his riches? Does he become impatient of restraint? Unless heart, mind, and soul are daily consecrated to God, and unless he renders thanksgiving to God for his entrusted gifts, thankful that the Lord has placed His talent in his hands to do good, to advance His cause, to bring in his gifts--tithes and offerings to the Lord's treasury as property accumulates--there will be a turning of these talents into wrong channels, where they will do positive harm to the human agent, and prove a temptation to allure and harm souls for whom Christ has died.",
