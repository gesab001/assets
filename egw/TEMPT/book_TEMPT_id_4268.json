    "word": "To some, deviation from perfect fairness in business deals may look like a small thing, but our Saviour does not thus regard it. His words on this point are plain and explicit: \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\" A man who will overreach in a small matter will overreach in a larger matter if the temptation comes to him.",
