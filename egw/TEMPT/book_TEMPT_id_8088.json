    "word": "I must ever keep close to Jesus Christ that I may constantly be a partaker of the divine nature and have a deep personal interest in those who have once been my best friends but in time of temptation have lifted up their heels against me. The love of Christ must not be extinguished in the soul. The prejudice against me cannot make me what they think I am, and I shall not feel hard toward them; but when I see my own brethren in the faith, responsible men, working in darkness, my heart aches. They have not injured me, but the Lord Jesus who has delegated me to bear His message to them.",
