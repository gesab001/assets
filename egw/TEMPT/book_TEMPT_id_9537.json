    "word": "God loves Brother Shireman, and will be with him, unless he draws away from the Source of his strength. Let our brother listen to the counsel of his brethren, and be as true as steel to principle. The enemy has tempted him sorely, and has nearly succeeded in spoiling his record. He has tempted him to do some strange things that God can not approve. But the Lord Jesus lives and reigns, and will deliver His servant from temptation.",
