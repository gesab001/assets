    "word": "O, how different are the standards by which God and man measure character! God sees many  temptations resisted, of which the world, and even near friends, never know,\u2014temptations in the home, in \n218\nthe heart; he sees the soul's humility in view of its own weakness, the sincere repentance over even a thought that is evil; he sees the whole heart's devotion to the upbuilding of the cause of God; he has noted those hours of hard battle with self\u2014battle that won the victory. All this, God and angels know.",
