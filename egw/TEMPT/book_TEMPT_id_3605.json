    "word": "If you are an intelligent Christian you will maintain religious vitality and will not be deterred by difficulties. . . . You will work the works of God in gloom as well as in glory, in shade as well as in sunshine, in trial \n130\nas well as in peace. The truth must be treasured up in your heart as well as incorporated in your being, so that no temptation and no argument can induce you to yield to Satan\u2019s suggestions or devices. The truth is precious. It has wrought important changes upon the life and upon the character, exerting a masterly influence over words, deportment, thoughts, and experience. The soul who appreciates the truth lives under its influence and senses the tremendous realities of eternal things. He lives not to himself, but to Jesus Christ who died for him. To him, God lives and is very cognizant of all his words and actions.",
