    "word": "Inspiration has said: \"If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.\" Psalm 62:10. Many have said: \"If I were as rich as such a one, I would multiply my gifts to the treasury of God. I would do nothing else with my wealth but use it for the advancement of the cause of God.\" God has tested some of these by giving them riches, but with the riches came the fiercer temptation, and their benevolence was far less than in the days of their poverty. A grasping desire for greater riches absorbed their minds and hearts, and they committed idolatry.  3T 401-405514",
