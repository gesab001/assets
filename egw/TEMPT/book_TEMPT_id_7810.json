    "word": "In order to benefit our people, and that our views might be distinctly understood by the citizens in the city of Battle Creek, that, as far as possible, the embarrassment might be removed attending the wearing of the reform dress, we called a health convention, inviting the most influential \n                                                                           59\ncitizens to attend that they might have a more perfect knowledge of the important subject of health reform. Before the large concourse of people there assembled we spoke upon the subject of dress reform, giving our reasons why we adopted this style of dress, and the advantages to be gained healthwise as well as the advantages derived from a Christian standpoint. We told the people we viewed the adopting of the reform dress would prove a safeguard to preserve us from the temptation of following the absurd, unhealthful, extravagant fashions of this age. We did not wear the reform dress to be odd and singular, but we adopted and advocated the reform dress from principle. Judge of our feelings when we saw upon the platform where we stood, among the singers, several sisters who had previously worn the reform dress appear upon this occasion with their long dresses. We greatly desired to correctly represent the dress reform upon this occasion above all others. We thought that if this is all the principle and wisdom our sisters have, what dependence can be placed upon them. Pride blinds their judgment so that they do not seem to understand the fitness of things.",
