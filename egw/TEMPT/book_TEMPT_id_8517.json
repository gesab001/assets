    "word": "Pride of heart, if cherished, creates envy, evil surmising, and even revenge. There is danger, then, that words or actions may be exaggerated into grievous, intentional offenses, and that the one who you think has done you an injustice will be treated with coldness, indifference, or contempt. Yet these very persons the Lord has charge of; angels of God minister unto them. He who \n\n\n                             -189- \n\nreads the heart may see more genuine goodness in them than in him who harbors ill feelings against them for supposed wrong. \"If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; if he repent, forgive Him.\" Treat him and his errors as you wish God to treat you when you offend Him. Charity does not rejoice in evil; revenge does.",
