    "word": "Sister White: If he is granted considerably more than other physicians, they will come to believe they are not treated right unless they have more also. We must move cautiously and understandingly, and not allow wages to creep so high that many will be tempted. There may have to be a coming down rather than going up, in physicians' wages, because there is a great work to be done. Unless you have some clear light from the Lord, it is not advisable to pay one man considerably more than another doing a similar work. For, if you do, the others will think it perfectly proper to expect similar high wages. We must look at all things on all sides, and it is of no use for us to think that we can offer a successful worker a high wage simply because he may demand it. We must, rather, consider what we can  afford to do at the present time, when the fields are opening upon which we shall henceforth have to expand much more means than we have spent hitherto. These are matters that will test the faith of our people.",
