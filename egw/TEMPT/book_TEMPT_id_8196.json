    "word": "MR No. 598 - Study Materials in SDA Schools\n\n     Infidel arguments have been brought into the college for the purpose of instructing our youth how to argue against infidelity. The seeds of infidelity may not at once be developed, yet they will manifest their existence when temptation arises. I have been shown that doubts will enter the heart, arguments in favor of infidelity will fasten in the mind which will finally lead to skepticism as a result of this course.--Letter 22, 1889, pp. 9, 10. (To R. A. Underwood, January 18, 1889.)",
