    "word": "Such has been Satan\u2019s work from the days of Adam to the present, and he has pursued it with great success. He tempts people to distrust God\u2019s love and to doubt His wisdom. He is constantly seeking to excite a spirit of irreverent curiosity, a restless, inquisitive desire to penetrate the secrets of divine wisdom and power. In their efforts to search out what God has been pleased to withhold, multitudes overlook the truths that He has revealed, and that are essential to salvation.\u2014Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 53-55.",
