    "word": "When men or women are under the temptations of Satan, let them look constantly to Jesus for aid, and not utter words of passion that dishonor Christ. If the husband speaks unkindly, let the wife not speak a word in response, for at such times silence is eloquence. This is the best way to meet the words that are prompted by the tempter. Let husband and wife treat each other kindly under all circumstances, then the children will learn from them lessons of forbearance. Never, never give your children an education in fault-finding. Set them an example that will help them to prepare for the future immortal life.",
