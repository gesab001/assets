    "word": "\"Do not think the Bible will become a tiresome book to the children. Under a wise instructor, the work will become more and more desirable. It will be to them as the bread of life, and will never grow old. There is in it a freshness and beauty that attract and charm the children and youth. . . . God's holy educating Spirit is in his Word. . . . The promises spoken by the Great Teacher will captivate the senses and animate the soul of the child with a spiritual power that is divine. There will grow in the faithful a familiarity with divine things which will be as a barricade against the temptations of the enemy.\"--P. C. Dec. 15, 1897.",
