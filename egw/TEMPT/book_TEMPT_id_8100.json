    "word": "I have been instructed that the youth are exposed to the greatest peril of being corrupted by improper reading. Could a large share of the books published be consumed, a plague would be stayed that is doing a fearful work upon human minds, and corrupting human hearts. Satan is constantly leading both the youth and those of mature age to be charmed with feeble stories. None are so confirmed in right principles, so secure from temptation, that they can feel safe, and think that no one need be anxious about them. All this trashy reading should be resolutely discarded.",
