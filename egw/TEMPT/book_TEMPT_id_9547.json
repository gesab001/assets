    "word": "Could our eyes be opened, we should behold Satan watching for an opportunity to stir up the human passions, to prompt men and women to speak words that cause the tempted one to lose vantage ground with God and to stand on the enemy's ground, where he will be overcome by Satan's wiles. Thus the confidence of the brethren in one another is hurt and destroyed. Let every one look unto Jesus, and keep the tongue from uttering any words but those that Jesus uttered when he was tempted in all points like as we are. He always met the tempter with the words, \"It is written.\" This we can do in all safety. When the feelings are stirred, not one word should be uttered, even in answer to a provoking question. \n\n\n                                      -292-",
