    "word": "Dear Willie, watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation. Have set seasons for prayer. Guard yourself. He that controlleth his own spirit is greater than he that taketh a city. Jesus will help you, Willie; He will bless you. It is important for you to think before you speak and act. Do nothing that you will regret afterwards.",
