    "word": "He who opens his heart to the suggestions of the enemy in evil surmisings and jealousy frequently misconstrues this evil-mindedness to be special foresight, discrimination or discernment to detect guilt and wrong motives in others; he regards it as a precious gift vouchsafed to him, and he draws apart from his brethren, with whom he should be in harmony. He climbs upon the judgment seat and shuts his heart against the one he supposes has erred, as though he himself were above temptation. Jesus separates from him, and leaves him to walk in the sparks of his own kindling.",
