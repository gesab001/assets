    "word": "As a priest, Christ is now set down with the Father in His throne. Upon the throne with the eternal, self-existent One, is He who \"hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows\" (Isaiah 53:4), who \"was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin\" (Hebrews 4:15).... \"If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father\" (1 John 2:1). His intercession is that of a pierced and broken body, of a spotless life. The wounded hands, the pierced side, the marred feet, plead for fallen man, whose redemption was purchased at such infinite cost.",
