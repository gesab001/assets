    "word": "Thus one perplexity after another kept coming in until I am completely exhausted with heart trouble. It seemed sometimes that I should not recover. For several days I have not been able to sit up much, and have been so weak that I could not endure that sound of the human voice. But the day before yesterday I was beginning to feel a little stronger, and today [I am] still better. I am up very early, for I have not slept past two \n\n\n                                -288- \n\no'clock for many mornings in succession. But I am in the hands of the Lord. I have tried to think of a place somewhere where for some weeks I could be free from perplexity and anxiety, but I do not know where that place can be. But the Lord sees, the Lord knows, and He can help; He can carry this burden which presses me so heavily. The greatest difficulty, the very weightiest burden, is the thought of the souls who have been tempted and are being rejoiced over by the synagogue of Satan.",
