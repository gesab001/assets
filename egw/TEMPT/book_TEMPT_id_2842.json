    "word": "That simple faith which takes God at His word should be encouraged. God's people must have that faith which will lay hold of divine power; \"for by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God\" (Ephesians 2:8). Those who believe that God for Christ's sake has forgiven their sins, should not, through temptation, fail to press on to fight the good fight of faith. Their faith should grow stronger until their Christian life, as well as their words, shall declare, \"The blood of Jesus Christ . . . cleanseth us from all sin\" (1 John 1:7).",
