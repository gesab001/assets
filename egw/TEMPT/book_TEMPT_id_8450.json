    "word": "Christ takes us into covenant relation with Himself. He loves us with an everlasting love, but He does not always give us what we desire. When we wander away from Him, He permits trials to come upon us, to cause us to return to Him with full purpose of heart. And when we return, He receives us with loving assurances of pardon. He does not allow us to be tempted above that we are able.",
