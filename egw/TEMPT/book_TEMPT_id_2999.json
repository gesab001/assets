    "word": "When Christ Refused to Work Miracles \n\n     The scene of Christ's temptation was to be a lesson for all His followers. When the enemies of Christ, by the instigation of Satan, request them to show some miracle, they should answer them as meekly as the Son of God answered Satan, \"It is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\" If they will not be convinced by inspired testimony, a manifestation of God's power would not benefit them. God's wondrous works are not manifested to gratify the curiosity of any. Christ, the Son of God, refused to give Satan any proof of His power. He made no effort to remove Satan's \"if\" by showing a miracle.",
