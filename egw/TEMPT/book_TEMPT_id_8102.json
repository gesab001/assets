    "word": "The enemy is at work in every way to divert from the study of the Scriptures. In the cars, or wherever you go, you will find men trying to sell trashy magazines. You may be tempted to buy some of these magazines and put them on your tables. But do not place on your tables light reading for the perusal of whoever may come to visit you. Keep the Word there.--Ms 55, 1909, p. 4. (\"Lessons from the Sermon on the Mount,\" Talk, August 16, 1909.)",
