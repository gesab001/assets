    "word": "Visit With a Discouraged Family--Yesterday in the morning Brethren [G. B.] Starr and McCullagh, Sister Starr and Sister White rode out thirteen miles in the country to visit brethren at Castle Hill. . . . We had been offered the use of that horse to go into country places, if we needed him, \n\n\n                                   -78- \n\nbut his slow movements decided us not to enter into temptation by trying to drive such an animal. The King's business requires haste, but we could not dispatch it in haste if we depended on such a horse to take us from place to place.",
