    "word": "The People Murmur \n\n     When the armies of Israel prospered, they took all the glory to themselves; but when they were tested and proved by hunger or warfare they charged all their hardships to Moses. The power of God which was manifested in a remarkable manner in their deliverance from Egypt, and seen from time to time all through their journeyings, should have inspired them with faith and forever closed their mouths from one expression of ingratitude.

The experience they passed through in the matter of worshiping the golden calf should have made so deep an impression upon their minds as never to be effaced.
