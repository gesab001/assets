    "word": "Your letter came yesterday, and I will respond at once, fearing that something may come in to crowd out the answer due you. . . . I can understand your state of feeling, your hopelessness and discouragement. I am not now in any way hopeless in regard to your case. I understand that at times you are sorely tempted, and lose confidence in your ability to resist temptation, because your inclination leads you in wrong paths; but Jesus loves you; you are the purchase of His blood.",
