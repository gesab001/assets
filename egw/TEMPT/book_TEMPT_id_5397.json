    "word": "396\n \n \n     The prince of darkness has a masterly mind, and he skillfully adapts his temptations to men of every variety of condition and culture. He works \"with all deceivableness of unrighteousness\" to gain control of the children of men, but he can accomplish his object only as they voluntarily yield to his temptations. Those who place themselves in his power by indulging their evil traits of character, little realize where their course will end. The tempter accomplishes their ruin, and then employs them to ruin others.",
