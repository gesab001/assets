    "word": "Frequently the truth and facts are to be plainly spoken to the erring, to make them see and feel their error, that they may reform. But this should ever be done with pitying tenderness, not with harshness or severity, but considering one's own weakness, lest he also be tempted. When the one at fault sees and acknowledges his error, then, instead of grieving \n94\nhim, and seeking to make him feel more deeply, comfort should be given. In the sermon of Christ upon the mount, he said, \u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\u201d [Matthew 7:1-4.] Our Saviour reproved for rash judgment. \u201cWhy beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,\u201d \u201cand, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\u201d [Matthew 7:1-4.] It is frequently the case that while one is quick to discern the errors of his brethren, he may be in greater faults himself, but be blind to them.",
