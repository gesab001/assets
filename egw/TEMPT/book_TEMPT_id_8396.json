    "word": "Now, the Lord would have us pursue a course that can be an example to others. We are right in the last days. The women should take charge of the women, and the men take charge of the men whenever they are sick and privately sick. Do not in such cases mix up men and women. See that you remove temptations. I cannot tell you how many have come to me with their complaints, and wanted me to heal these difficulties, but I felt as though I was not prepared to do it. But recently the light has come to me that too great commonness has been practiced. It must be that the women will take charge of the women, and the men take charge of the men. Of course, there are some things in which they have to mingle. Women will have to do some things. But it is too great commonness that has been brought in, and this has been brought before me several times. But I felt as though I could not rein myself up to touch the point.",
