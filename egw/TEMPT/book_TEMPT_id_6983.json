    "word": "A constant battle is going on between satanic agencies and heavenly intelligences. Satan is playing the game of life for the souls of men. If all could see the undercurrent of specious temptations, if they could realize the apparently heavenly appearance of satanic deceptions, far greater caution would be shown. There would be far more distrust of human wisdom and far more dependence upon God. But, when our spiritual eyesight is blinded, we do not discover the marked incidents that have taken place to turn the footsteps of God's people from safe paths into paths that are slippery and unreliable.",
