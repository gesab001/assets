    "word": "MR No. 917 - Ellen White's Generosity in Australia\n\n     In this country I have found destitution and poverty everywhere, and had I not means to relieve the distressed, to clothe the naked, to take the youth who are too poor to help themselves and place them in schools, and to help the churches in building houses of worship, we should have left the field long ago; for it would be useless to attempt to do anything, hampered on every side. In a letter of mine copied by someone at the Pacific Press, the statement appears that I had spent $100 to educate students. It was $1,000, and $2,000 has been used in helping in different places where help was really needed.",
