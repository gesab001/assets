    "word": "Christ has given His precious life to make it possible to establish a church that will be capable of caring for sorrowful, tempted, perishing souls. He has bought us with His own life, shed His own blood in order that He might wash away the stains of sin, and clothe us with the garments of salvation. The church must build on Christ by carrying out as His representative the mind and spirit of Christ. His people are to be links in the golden chain that binds souls one to another and to God. We are to put forth personal efforts for the saving of souls that are ready to perish. Christ said, \"Ye are the light of the world\" [Matthew 5:14].",
