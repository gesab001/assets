Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord\" (Colossians 3:15, 16).

With spiritual songs He stopped the fluent speech of those whom Satan was using to create strife. . . .",
