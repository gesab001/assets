    "word": "Truth must become truth to the receiver, to all intents and purposes. It must be stamped on the heart. \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\" (Romans 10:10). \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength\" (Mark 12:30). This is the service that God accepts. . . . The heart is the citadel of the being, and until that is wholly on the Lord's side the enemy will gain constant victories over us through his subtle temptations. . . .",
