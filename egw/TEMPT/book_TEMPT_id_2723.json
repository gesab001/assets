    "word": "Your only course is to give yourself unreservedly into the hands of Jesus--all your experiences, all your temptations, all your trials, all your impulses--and let the Lord mold you as clay is molded in the hands of the potter. You are not your own and therefore there is the necessity of giving your unmanageable self into the hands of One who is able to manage you. Then rest, precious rest and peace will come to your soul.",
