    "word": "The crafty deceiver has been found to be an accuser, a liar, a tormentor and a murderer; but whatever he may have led others to say concerning you, the Lord can say to him as He said to Peter, \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\" He can say to him, \"You shall not come in between this soul and Me. You shall not interpose yourself between Me and the soul for whom I died a ransom.\" It is for you, my tempted sister, to dismiss Satan with his temptations, and to take Jesus. Press close to Jesus, and place your hand in His, and He will firmly hold your hand, and never let go of the soul who maintains his faith in Him. . . .",
