    "word": "I WISH TO NOTE HER CHARACTER AS A FRIEND, AND I AM SURE THAT ALL WHO KNOW HER HERE WILL VERIFY WHAT I SAY. HER REMEMBRANCE OF NAMES OF INDIVIDUALS WAS VERY REMARKABLE.  SHE NEVER SEEMED TO FORGET A PERSON WHOM SHE MET IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD.  SHE CARRIED THEM ON HER HEART AND IN HER PRAYERS.  HER FAITHFULNESS IN FRIENDSHIP WAS VERY MARKED, EXTENDING THROUGH TRIAL AND TEMPTATION.  AS THE LITTLE BOY AT SCHOOL SAID WHEN ASKED THE MEANING OF FRIENDSHIP, \"A TRUE FRIEND IS ONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOU AND LOVES YOU JUST THE SAME,\" SO WE CAN SAY OF HER, THAT THOUGH SHE KNEW THE FAILINGS OF HER FRIENDS VERY WELL, SHE LOVED THEM JUST THE SAME, AND PRAYED FOR THEM AND LABORED FOR THEM JUST THE SAME.",
