Kellogg: \n\n\n     Dear Brother,--- \n\n\n     I would help if I could, but I do not know how to help you. The dangers of your plan  of operation in connection with the Conference held in South Lancaster were presented before me. I saw that you could not plan and devise as you had been doing, to carry out your ideas, without injury to yourself and to the cause of God. I was instructed by the Lord that your temptation would be to make your medical missionary work stand above every other work independent of the Conference. But this plan was not right. You were tempted by the enemy, and I hasten to write to you. I sent a copy of the letter to Elder Irwin; for it was necessary that some one besides yourself should know your danger, that efforts might be made to save you from the course of action you had premeditated.",
