    "word": "I am instructed to bear a testimony to those who are entertaining erroneous sentiments and to tell them plainly of their danger. But we are in no case to link up with them or to argue with them. Truth is truth, and we are to stand on the affirmative side, presenting the truth and refusing to be drawn into controversy. When Christ was tempted, His weapon was, \"It is written.\" He refused to argue with Satan. \"Again, the devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto Him, All these things will I \n\n\n                                                                  page 7 \n\ngive thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me\" (Matthew 4:8, 9). The time had come for Christ to bear a positive message. \"Get thee hence, Satan;\" he said, \"for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth Him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto Him\" (Matthew 4:10).",
