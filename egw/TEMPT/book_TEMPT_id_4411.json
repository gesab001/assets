    "word": "Chap. 41 - Third Temptation of Christ\n[THIS\nARTICLE APPEARED IN THE REVIEW AND\nHERALD, SEPT. 1, 1874.]\n\n     Our Saviour showed perfect confidence in His heavenly Father, that He would not suffer Him to be tempted above what He should give Him strength to endure, and would bring Him off conqueror if He patiently bore the test to which He was subjected. Christ had not, of His own will, placed Himself in danger. God had suffered Satan, for the time being, to have this power over His Son. Jesus knew that if He preserved His integrity in this extremely trying position, an angel of God would be sent to relieve Him if there was no other way. He had taken humanity, and was the representative of the race.",
