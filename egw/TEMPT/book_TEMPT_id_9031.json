    "word": "When doubt and murmuring are expressed because of the trials on the way to the heavenly Canaan, let not the elders, the ministers and presidents, by their words of unsanctified sympathy, water the seeds of disaffection, and then present the matter in an exaggerated light, as if a terrible rebellion were about to take place, and suppose they are helping the cause of God in so doing. They strengthen the suggestions and temptations of the prince of darkness, and open a wide door for the enemy to enter and take possession of the souls of the people, as he did under the false report of the unfaithful spies.",
