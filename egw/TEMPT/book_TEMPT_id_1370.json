    "word": "Facing Readers in Judgment.--My attention has been called to your articles in our papers in reference to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In the work of temperance all church members are supposed to stand upon the platform of union. Your putting on the appearance of antagonism is natural to you, but it is not after the order of Christ. You are building up barricades that should not be made to appear. After reading your articles, will those who know not what our faith is feel inclined to make an attempt to unite with us? The tone of your articles savors of pharisaism. The man who expects to enlighten a deceived people must come near to them and labor for them in love. He must become a center of holy influences. . . .",
