    "word": "In the Revelation he [Satan] is declared to be the \"accuser of our brethren,\" \"which accused them before our God day and night.\" Revelation 12:10. The controversy is repeated over every soul that is rescued from the power of evil and whose name is registered in the Lamb's book of life. Never is one received from the family of Satan into the family of God without exciting the determined resistance of the wicked one. . . . He leads men into skepticism, causing them to lose confidence in God and to separate from His love; he tempts them to break His law, and then he claims them as his captives and contests the right of Christ to take them from him. He knows that those who seek God earnestly for pardon and grace will obtain it; therefore he presents their sins before them to discourage them. . . . By countless devices, the most subtle and the most cruel, he endeavors to secure their condemnation.",
