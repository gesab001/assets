    "word": "My nephew, Frank Belden, has written me several letters regarding matters in Battle Creek, but these letters I have not read, for his own sake and for the sake of those who, when I send the reproofs that God gives, are liable to be tempted to think and say, \"Somebody has told her or written to her.\" I shall not read these letters of Frank Belden's now, and perhaps not at all.
