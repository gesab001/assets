    "word": "Satan, the fallen prince, was jealous of God. He determined through subtlety, cunning, and deceit to defeat God\u2019s purpose. He approached Eve, not in the form of an angel, but as a serpent, subtle, cunning, and deceitful. With a voice that appeared to proceed from the serpent, he spoke to her. . . .

He believed the words of the enemy of God. . . .",
