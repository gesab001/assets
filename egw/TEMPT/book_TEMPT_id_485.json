    "word": "The important future is before us. To meet its trials and temptations, and to perform its duties, will require great faith and perseverance. But we may triumph gloriously, for not one watching, praying, believing soul will be ensnared by the devices of the enemy. All heaven is interested in our welfare and waits our demand upon its wisdom and strength. In the time of trial just before us, God\u2019s pledge of security will be placed upon those who have kept the word of His patience.\u2014Manuscript 100, 1893.",
