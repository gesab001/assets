    "word": "When you are tempted to speak unadvisedly, be on guard. If some one else approaches you with words of criticism regarding one of God's children, turn a deaf ear to every such word. If you are spoken to harshly, never retaliate. Utter not a word. When under provocation, remember that \"silence in eloquence.\" Silence is the greatest rebuke that you can possibly give to a faultfinder or one whose temper is irritated.",
