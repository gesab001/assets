    "word": "I had a long conversation with Brother Davis this morning. Poor man, he is in trouble. He once dabbled with spiritualism and theosophy, and its dark influence has shrouded him ever since. Although he sees the truth and believes the truth, yet there seems to be a bondage to this power that it is hard for him to break. I could only bid him \"Look and live.\" An uplifted Saviour will heal the serpent's bite, and although its poison has been diffused through his entire being, I could say to him, \"Look and live.\" Satan has indeed tempted him and desired to sift him as wheat, but Christ is a living Saviour and Advocate in the courts of heaven in his behalf. May the Lord deliver him from the cruel power of Satan is my prayer.",
