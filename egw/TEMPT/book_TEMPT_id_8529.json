    "word": "My brother, you will be sorely tried and tempted at times; but ever remember that Jesus Christ is at your right hand to help you. Cast all your burdens upon the Lord, for He hath promised, \"I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.\" Rest yourself wholly in the hands of Jesus. Contemplate His great love; and while you meditate upon His self-denial, His infinite sacrifice made in our behalf in order that we should believe in Him, your heart will be filled with holy joy, calm peace, and indescribable love.",
