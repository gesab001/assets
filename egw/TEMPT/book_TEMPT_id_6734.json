    "word": "The Lord will raise up a standard for us against the enemy. We should believe that we have a helper in God, that we shall not be afraid, we shall not be filled with wonder and amazement; for we know that the God of Israel has been with His people from the very first--from the very infancy of this world God has been with His obedient children. We must show that we have confidence in God, and make it manifest to the world that we can trust Him because we believe in Him. His word is pledged that there shall no temptation come upon us, but that help shall be provided to sustain us. . . .",
