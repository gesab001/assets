    "word": "The rum-seller takes the same position as did Cain, and says, \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" And God says to him, as He said to Cain, \"The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground.\" Genesis 4:9, 10. Liquor-dealers will be held accountable for the wretchedness and misery brought into the homes of those who are weak in moral power, and who fall through temptation to drink. They will be charged with the misery, the suffering, the hopelessness brought into the world through the liquor traffic. They will have to answer for the want and woe of the mothers and children who have suffered for food, and clothing, and shelter, who have buried all hope and joy. He who has a care for the sparrow, and notes its fall to the ground, who \"clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven,\" will not pass by those who have been formed in his own image, purchased with his own blood, and pay no heed to their suffering cries. God marks this wickedness that perpetuates misery and crime. He charges it all up to those whose influence helps to open the door of temptation to the soul.",
