    "word": "Christ did not exalt man by ministering to his pride. He humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross: and unless human pride is humbled and subdued, unless the stubborn heart is made tender by the Spirit of Christ, it is not possible for him to impress his divine similitude upon us. He, the humble Nazarene, might have poured contempt upon the world's pride; for he was commander in the heavenly courts, but he came to our world in humility, in order to show that it is not riches, or position, or authority, or honorable titles, that the universe of heaven respects and honors, but those who will follow Christ, making any position of duty honorable by the virtue of their character, through the power of his grace.",
