    "word": "Enoch lived in a corrupt age, when moral power was very weak. Pollution was teeming all around him, yet he walked with God. He educated his mind to devotion--to think on things that were pure and holy; and his conversation was upon holy and divine things. He was made a companion of God. He walked with Him, and received His counsel. He had to contend with the same temptations that we do. The society surrounding him was no more friendly to righteousness than is the society surrounding us at the present time. The atmosphere he breathed was tainted with sin and corruption, the same as ours, yet he was unsullied with the prevailing sins of the age in which he lived. And so may we remain as pure and uncorrupted as did the faithful Enoch.",
