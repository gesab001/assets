    "word": "In the word of God we are encouraged to study the character of the world's Redeemer. He is the pattern of every man in his work of character-building. The Son of God was tempted in all points like as we are, but He resisted every temptation. Through prayer He obtained the power to become victor in the struggle with the powers of Satan. In the groves and mountains the Saviour spent whole nights in prayer for Himself and His disciples, and for those for whom His disciples would labor. Christ's followers are to find strength where their Master found it.",
