    "word": "The heavenly universe is watching with the deepest interest the conflict between Christ in the person of His saints, and the great deceiver. Those who recognize and resist temptation are fighting the Lord's battles. To such are given the commendation, \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation.\" Endurance of temptation means the cultivation of patience. The tempted, harassed soul cannot trust in his own strength of purpose. Feeling his utter helplessness, he flees to the stronghold, saying, \"My Saviour, I cast my helpless soul upon Thee.\" The fiercer the temptation, the more strongly he clings to the Mighty One.",
