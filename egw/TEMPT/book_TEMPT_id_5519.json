Pledge yourself to entire abstinence, for it is your only safety. . . . Let not one son by his words and his example become Satan's agent to tempt one of the members of the family to lead to indulge and awaken the demon appetite which spoiled the life of the father and sent him prematurely to the grave.--Manuscript 25, 1893.",
