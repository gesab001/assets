    "word": "Deeper Piety Needed. \n\n     Right at the head of the work there must be deeper piety, more faithful taking heed to the word of God, a watching for souls as they that must give an account. Each worker should be moved by a living, abiding, converting principle. It is not large establishments where much money is invested to make them more convenient, that will obtain influence and win hearts. The school and the Office should be an asylum for the sorely tempted youth. They are God's property. They have hearts to be won; they have souls to save. Instead of spending money in bicycles, in picture-making, in little and great idols to place upon your tables and on your walls, let the means be used to gather in the youth; teach them, and patiently watch over them, in wisdom dealing with their follies. Pray with them alone. Converse with \n\n\n                      -7- \n\nthem, with hearts filled with pity and that love which Christ has shown for you. Angels of God will give every true worker a rich experience in doing this work. We are to labor in earnest to break down every barrier that has been built up to keep Christ from entering the citadel of the heart. There is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine persons that think they need no repentance. Let instructors do their duty patiently, and although they may be often tried, be assured they will not fail nor be discouraged. Be not weary in well-doing; the heavenly intelligences will work with your every effort. A word of love and encouragement will do more to subdue the hasty temper and wilful disposition than all the fault-finding and severe censure that you can heap upon the erring ones.",
