    "word": "Peril in Vanity \n\n     I call upon all who are engaged in the service of God to place themselves fully on Christ's side. There are dangers on the right hand and on the left. Our greatest danger will come from men who have lifted up their souls unto vanity, who have not heeded the words of warning and reproof sent them by God. As such men choose their own will and way, the tempter, clothed in angel robes, is close beside them ready to unite his influence with theirs, He opens to them delusions of a most attractive character, which they present to the people of God. Some of those who listen to them will de deceived and will work in dangerous lines. \n                                                                           96",
