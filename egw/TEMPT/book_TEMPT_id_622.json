    "word": "Haphazard Leadership--You love praise and excitement and to bring yourself to the front.  You care far more for the approbation and praise of men than for the approval of God.  You lead others.  They do not know where you are leading them neither do you, because you go on haphazard, heedless, impulsive, without sound judgment, or heavenly wisdom.  God has warned you.  God has counseled you.  Have you trembled at His word?  Have you resisted temptations?  Have you separated yourself more and from worldly influences?--Letter 3, 1882, p. 3 (April 1, 1882).",
