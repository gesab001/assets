    "word": "Brother and Sister [G. B.] Starr are now in Adelaide. Brother [G. T.] Wilson was sent for, but was not able to go on account of his health. He has been spitting blood. He was down three weeks, got better, attempted to do some work, and has been down again. I think the climate of Tasmania is too severe for him. I hope he will soon go to the mild, warm atmosphere of Adelaide. All wish him to go. In connection with Brother Starr he could do good work in holding our people together. Even if he did not preach one discourse, he could establish, strengthen, and settle them. But we have no recent news from Adelaide or Tasmania.--Letter 143, 1897, p. 1. (To W. C. White, May 6, 1897.)",
