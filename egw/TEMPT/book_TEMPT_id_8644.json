    "word": "Christ knows the sinner's trials. He knows his temptations. He has taken upon Himself our nature. He was tempted in [all] points like as we are, and He knows how to succor those who shall be tempted. He has wept, and He knows your sorrows, He has witnessed all your griefs. To all who believe and trust in him He will be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest.",
