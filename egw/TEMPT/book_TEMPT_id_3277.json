    "word": "Deviation from perfect fairness in business deals may appear as a small thing in the estimation of some, but our Saviour did not thus regard it. His words on this point are plain and explicit: \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much\" (Luke 16:10). A man who will overreach his neighbor on a small scale will overreach in a larger scale if the temptation is brought to bear upon him. A false representation in a small matter is as much dishonesty in the sight of God as falsity in a larger matter.",
