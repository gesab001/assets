    "word": "All heaven was watching the working of the enemy against Christ when tempted in behalf of man. And all heaven is watching the striving of every individual soul under every temptation by which man shall be beset. If he will resist the temptation, if he will not yield on any point Satan cannot have the victory. And in the books of heaven will stand registered against your name that on such a day Satan sought to overthrow and ensnare one of my redeemed ones, but the tempted one looked to me, the conqueror, and I gave him angels to press back the powerful foe.",
