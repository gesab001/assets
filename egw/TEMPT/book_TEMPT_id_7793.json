    "word": "Christ presented before his hearers the parable of the gospel sower, which contains a lesson we should study. Those who preach present truth and scatter the good seed will realize the same results as the gospel sower. All classes will be affected more or less by the presentation of pointed and convincing truth. Some will be wayside hearers. They will be affected by the truths spoken, but they have not cultivated the moral powers. They have followed inclination rather than duty. Evil habits have hardened their hearts like the hard, beaten road. These may profess to believe the truth, but will have no just sense of its sacredness and elevated character. They do not separate from the friendship of the lovers of pleasure and corrupt society. They place themselves where they are constantly tempted, and may well be represented by the unfenced field. They invite the temptations of the enemy and finally lose the regard they seemed once to have for the truth when the good seed was dropped into their hearts.",
