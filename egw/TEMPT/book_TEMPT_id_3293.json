    "word": "Overtaxed Mind Opens Door to Temptation.--Students who apply themselves wholly to brain labor in the schoolroom injure the whole living machinery by confinement. The brain is wearied, and Satan brings in a whole list of temptations, enticing them to engage in forbidden indulgences, to have a change, to let off steam. Yielding to these temptations, they do wrong things which injure themselves and do mischief to others. This may be done only in sport [frolic]. The brain is active and they desire to play some pranks. But someone must undertake to undo the mischief they did under temptation.--Lt 103, 1897.",
