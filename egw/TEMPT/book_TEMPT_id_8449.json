    "word": "Trust Implicitly in God.--This history [of Elijah, in discouragement fleeing at Jezebel's threat], carefully and prayerfully studied, will be a help to the people of God under difficulties. Let man be careful not to assume responsibilities that God does not require of him, and interpose himself between the Lord and His tempted and tried ones so that the purposes of God shall not be carried out in the experiences of these persons. Difficulties will arise before the people of God, but every soul must put his trust not in the wisdom of men but in the Lord God of Israel. He will be his defense. Only let each person keep in the way of duty, and not let fear discourage him. In trusting implicitly in God, we shall see the wonderful display of His power, if we wait patiently and prayerfully for Him, and have confidence in God.--Manuscript 6, 1889, pp. 18, 19. (\"Counsel Written on the Last Day of the General Conference Session of 1889,\" Battle Creek, Michigan, Nov. 4, 1889.)",
