    "word": "By showing contempt for the laws of nature, men and women lay the foundation for misery and suffering. Through the weakness of their moral powers they are abject slaves to passion. Some are digging their graves with their own teeth; others defile soul and body and weaken their brain power by yielding to vile habits of moral pollution. By this they close the gates of the city of God against themselves, for the penalty of violated laws must be realized. The punishment must come. . . .",
