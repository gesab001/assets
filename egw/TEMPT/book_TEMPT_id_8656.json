    "word": "\"Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God.\" Who calls them so? All the heavenly intelligences. Then do not encourage any tempted soul to tell you the grievances of a brother or a friend. Tell them that you do not want to hear their words of censure and evil speaking, because your Counsellor has told you in His Word that if you cease to stir up strife, and become a peacemaker, you will be blessed. Tell them that this is the blessing you are craving.",
