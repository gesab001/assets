    "word": "The divine Teacher bears with the erring through all their perversity. His love does not grow cold; his efforts to win them do not cease. With outstretched arms he waits to welcome again and again the erring, the rebellious, and even the apostate. His heart is touched with the helplessness of the little child subject to rough usage. The cry of human suffering never reaches his ear in vain. Though all are precious in his sight, the rough, sullen, stubborn dispositions draw most heavily upon his sympathy and love; for he traces from cause to effect. The one who is most easily tempted, and is most inclined to err, is the special object of his solicitude.",
