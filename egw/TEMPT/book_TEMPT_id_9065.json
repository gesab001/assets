    "word": "-221- \n\n     Having access, as we do, to the Source of all strength, why should we be content to remain so weak that we yield to the temptations of the enemy? Having so great an assurance of power to enable us to overcome, why are we so faithless? Why do we not overcome every time we are tempted to be hasty in speech? We should pray much more than we do. In every hour of trial we may find victory through the strength given in answer to prevailing prayer.",
