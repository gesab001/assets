    "word": "How, in Solomon's case, was weak, vacillating character--naturally bold, firm, and determined--shaken like a reed in the wind under the tempter's power! How has an old, gnarled cedar of Lebanon, a sturdy oak of Bashan, bent before the blast of temptation! What a lesson for all who desire to save their souls to watch unto prayer continually. What a warning to keep the grace of Christ ever in their heart, to battle with inward corruptions and outward temptations.",
