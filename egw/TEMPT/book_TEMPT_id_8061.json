    "word": "My Brother A. R. Henry, I have a message for you. . . . I have a message for those in Battle Creek who have been overcome by the temptations of the adversary. I call upon those who are accusing their brethren, and who are taking an attitude that hinders the Lord's work, to come into harmony. . . . I beg of you, for Christ's sake, not to find fault with others, but to deal with your own mistakes. Notwithstanding the trouble and perplexity you have made for others, the Lord is very merciful, and if you repent, He will pardon you. But you cannot gain favor with God by trying to make your brethren appear in the worst light. Your only hope is to deal honestly with yourself. Keep away from worldly lawyers. This is the rock on which many have wrecked their barque. . . .",
