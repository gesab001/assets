    "word": "Daniel loved, feared, and obeyed God. Yet he did not flee away from the world to avoid its corrupting influence. In the providence of God, he was to be in the world, yet not of the world. With all the temptations and fascinations of court life surrounding him, he stood in the integrity of his soul, firm as a rock to principle. He made God his strength, and was not forsaken of him in his time of greatest need. \n                                                                           51",
