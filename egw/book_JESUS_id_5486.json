{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     The reason why you fail to appreciate that which comes to you in warnings and reproofs from the word of God, is chiefly owing to your own self. You are inclined to self-importance, and your pride is wounded frequently, because you have not the meekness of character to bow at the foot of the cross. If you call to mind the Author and Finisher of your faith, and realize what he has suffered,\\97 that he went without the camp, bearing reproach that you might be saved,\\97then you will think that you are suffering nothing. What you want is the spirit of Jesus. You need to cherish it continually; and then when difficulties shall arise, you will be hid in Christ, and will manifest his spirit. You should not encourage a feeling of sympathy and pity for yourself. Self should be hid in Jesus, and then you will feel such sincere sorrow and pity for the souls who do not know what is for their best good, that you will forget all about your being misused.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 367}
