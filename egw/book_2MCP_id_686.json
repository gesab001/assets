{"word": "Desolating Hail or Seeds of Love?--Some are seen to come forth from their daily communion with God clothed with the meekness of Christ. Their words are not like a desolating hail, crushing everything before it; they come forth sweetly from their lips. They scatter seeds of love and kindness all along their path, and that all unconsciously, because Christ lives in their heart. Their influence is felt more than it is seen.--MS 24, 1887. (3BC 1159.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 572}
