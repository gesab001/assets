{"word": "As I have labored since 1843 and 1844 I have felt so thankful that the Lord has permitted time to last to do more fully the missionary work that was needing to be done to warn our cities. O our wise heavenly Father made the infinite sacrifice of His only begotten Son! He gave Him to our world that the world might, through the merciful provisions made, accept the Word--Bible truth--and prepare for the great event of His coming. That which caused the believing church so much sorrow in their disappointment in the time of His coming has been a reason of thanksgiving for the delay. Now the angels of God are preparing the way for the truth to reach all nations.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 349}
