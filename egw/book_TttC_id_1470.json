    "word": "The investigation was a thorough one and resulted in freeing us from the charges brought against us, and restoring feelings of perfect union. Hearty and heart-rending confessions of the cruel course pursued toward us here have been made, and the signal blessing of God has come upon us all. Backsliders have been reclaimed, sinners have been converted, and forty-four have been buried in baptism, my husband baptizing sixteen, and Brethren Andrews and Loughborough, twenty-eight. We are encouraged, yet much worn. My husband and myself have had the burden of the work, which has been very laborious and exciting. How we have, in our feeble state, gone through with the investigation, with the feelings of nearly all against us, endured the preaching, the exhortations, and the late evening meetings, and at the same time prepared this work, my husband working with me, copying and preparing it for the printers, and reading proof, God only knows. Yet we have passed through it and hope in God that He will sustain us in our future labors.",
