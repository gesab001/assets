{"word": "Christ heard the eager, hungering cry, \"We would see Jesus.\" These Greeks represented the nations and tribes and peoples who would awake to their great need of a power out of and above finite power. For a moment Christ looked into futurity, and heard voices proclaiming in all places of the earth, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (chap. 1:29). This anticipation, the consummation of His hopes, is expressed in His words, \"The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified\" (chap. 12:23). But the way and manner that this glorifying was to take place was never absent from Christ's mind. Only by His death could the world be saved. As the grain of wheat, the Son of man must be cast into the earth, and die, and be buried out of sight; but He was to live again!", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 110}
