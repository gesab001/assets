    "word": "Paul exhorted Timothy: \"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, \n                                                                           505\nin charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.\" \"Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.\" What a weight of importance is here attached to the Christian life of the minister of God! What a necessity for his faithful study of the word, that he himself may be sanctified by the truth and may be qualified to teach others.",
