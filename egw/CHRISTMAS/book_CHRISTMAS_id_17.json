{"word": "OF THIS LAW, SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS THE \\93ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITTANNICA\\94 PLAINLY SAYS: \\93IT WAS CONSTANTINE THE GREAT WHO FIRST MADE A LAW FOR THE PROPER OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY; AND WHO, ACCORDING TO EUSEBIUS, APPOINTED THAT IT SHOULD BE REGULARLY CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE ROMAN EMPIRE. BEFORE HIM, AND EVEN IN HIS TIME, THEY OBSERVED THE JEWISH SABBATH, AS WELL AS SUNDAY.\\94 AS TO THE DEGREE OF REVERENCE WITH WHICH SUNDAY WAS REGARDED, AND THE MANNER OF ITS OBSERVANCE, MOSHEIM SAYS THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LAW ENACTED BY CONSTANTINE, THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK WAS \\93OBSERVED WITH GREATER SOLEMNITY THAN IT HAD FORMERLY BEEN.\\94 [ECCL. HIST. CENT. 4, PART 2, CHAP. 4, SEC. 5.] YET CONSTANTINE PERMITTED ALL KINDS OF AGRICULTURAL LABOR TO BE PERFORMED ON SUNDAY! BISHOP TAYLOR DECLARES THAT \\93THE PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANS DID ALL MANNER OF WORKS UPON THE LORD'S DAY.\\94 [DUCT. DUBITANT., PART 1, BOOK 2, CHAP. 2, RULE 6, SEC. 59.] THE SAME STATEMENT IS MADE BY MORER: \\93THE DAY [SUNDAY] WAS NOT WHOLLY KEPT IN ABSTAINING FORM COMMON BUSINESS; NOR DID THEY [CHRISTIANS] ANY LONGER REST FROM THEIR ORDINARY AFFAIRS (SUCH WAS THE NECESSITY OF THOSE TIMES) THAN DURING THE DIVINE SERVICE.\\94 [DIALOGUES ON THE LORD'S DAY, P. 233.] SAYS COX: \\93THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT EITHER AT THIS [THE TIME OF CONSTANTINE], OR AT A PERIOD MUCH LATER, THE OBSERVANCE WAS VIEWED AS DERIVING ANY OBLIGATION FROM THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT; IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS AN INSTITUTION CORRESPONDING IN NATURE WITH CHRISTMAS, GOOD FRIDAY, AND OTHER FESTIVALS OF THE CHURCH.\\94 [COX'S SABBATH LAWS, P. 281.]", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 679}
