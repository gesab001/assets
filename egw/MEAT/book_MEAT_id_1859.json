    "word": "These disciples could not endure to be separated from Him who had instructed them, but they wanted more, so they constrained Him to abide with them. As He sat at meat with them, and took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them, He raised His hands. They noticed it was the motions of Christ, and in His hands they saw the signs of the crucifixion. \"And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him; and he vanished out of their sight\" (verse 31).",
