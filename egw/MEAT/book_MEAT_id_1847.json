    "word": "And now I would say to every one of you, if I have introduced into this little address any ideas that you will work upon, I shall feel that I am abundantly paid; and if I have helped to point the eye to Jesus Christ, I will praise Him for that. You want to educate your children to praise God. You want to educate them to bring their little offerings to God. You want to educate them not to make themselves a center and a core, and all the gifts of the parents be lavished upon the children. God's cause calls for money. God's cause calls for means that you may carry the light into the regions that are beyond. And then I beg of you, for Christ's sake, to let the treasury be supplied that God may have meat in His house.--Manuscript 43a, 1894. (MR 900.42)",
