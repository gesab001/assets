    "word": "Nurses should be familiar with the Scriptures, that from this rich storehouse they may draw for their patients words of comfort and consolation. Christ desires them to eat the bread of life, the leaves of the tree of life, that they may have something to give to the sick and the suffering around them. It is their privilege to pray for the sick, asking that the blessing of God may rest upon them. This institution should be permeated with the Spirit of the living God.",
