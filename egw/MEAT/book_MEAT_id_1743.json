    "word": "MR No. 1209 - Counsels to Our Colporteurs Regarding Carefulness in Diet\n(Cir. 1889)\n\n     If you are a Bible doer as well as a Bible reader, you must understand from the Scriptures that swine's flesh was prohibited by Jesus Christ enshrouded in the billowy cloud. This is not a test question. Directions have been given to families that such articles as butter and the eating largely of flesh meats is not the best for physical and mental health. Fruits and grains and vegetables would, if cooked properly and eaten in moderate quantities, be proper articles of diet.",
