    "word": "\"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof\" (Psalm 24:1). This world is the Lord's storehouse, from which we are ever drawing. He has provided fruits and grains and vegetables for our sustenance. For us He makes the sun to shine and the rain to fall. The whole human family, good and evil, are constantly drawing from God's storehouse. It makes every difference with those so highly privileged how they receive the Lord's gifts and how they treat the contract the Lord has made with them. He has made them His almoners, directing them to draw from His storehouse, and then make a return to Him in gifts and offerings, \"that there may be meat in mine house.\"--Manuscript 73, Dec. 12, 1900, \"Bring an Offering Unto the Lord.\"",
