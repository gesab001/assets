He will bring to the mind the words necessary for the occasion, that portion of His Word which will be meat in due season for the people. To His faithful servants God will be tongue and utterance. The Holy Spirit will make the word effective, to convict and convert souls. The seed sown will fall into good ground and will spring up to bring forth fruit unto life eternal. . . . \n     [1 Corinthians 9:24-27 quoted.]",
