    "word": "The Jews were experiencing the fulfillment of the curse of God for their departure from him, and for their iniquity. Yet they did not lay these things to heart, and afflict their souls before God. A people that hated them ruled over them. Yet they were claiming the blessings God promised to confer upon a people who were obedient and faithful, at the very time they were suffering under the curse of God because of disobedience. John declared to them that unless they bore fruit, they would be hewn down and cast into the fire. The people were convicted, and \"asked him, saying, What shall we do then? He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.\" The people were in expectation of Christ's soon appearing, and they questioned whether this prophet were not the Messiah. \"John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose; he shall baptize you \n                                                                           42\nwith the Holy Ghost, and with fire; whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.\"",
