    "word": "The Value of Fresh Fruits \n\n     The Lord desires those living in countries where fresh fruit can be obtained during a large part of the year, to awake to the blessing they have in this fruit. The more we depend upon the fresh fruit just as it is plucked from the tree, the greater will be the blessing. Some, after adopting a vegetarian diet, return to the use of flesh meat. \n                                                                           474\nThis is foolish indeed, and reveals a lack of knowledge of how to provide proper food in the place of meat.",
