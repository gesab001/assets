CANRIGHT, IN 1866, DOES ALLUDE TO DEUTERONOMY 14:8, \"AND THE SWINE, BECAUSE IT DIVIDETH THE HOOF, YET CHEWETH NOT THE CUD, IT IS UNCLEAN UNTO YOU; YE SHALL NOT EAT OF THEIR FLESH, NOR TOUCH THEIR DEAD CARCASS.\" BUT CANRIGHT MAKES NO MENTION OF OTHER UNCLEAN MEATS, AND MAKES NO USE OF THE FURTHER MATERIAL IN DEUTERONOMY 14 ON THE SUBJECT. WHEN HE DOES MENTION OYSTERS, IN AN ARTICLE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR, HE MENTIONS THEIR ALLEGED POWERS TO EXCITE \"CERTAIN KINDS OF FEELINGS,\" AND INTRODUCES NO BIBLICAL ARGUMENT.",
