    "word": "MR No. 1134 - In the Mountains of Colorado\n\n  (Written in the Colorado mountains, diary entry for September 28, 1873.) \n\n\n     Brother Glover left the camp today to go for supplies. We are getting short of provisions. We got him the best we could for his meals on the way. He was to send Mr. Walling immediately and to get our mail. A young man from Nova Scotia had come in from hunting. He had a quarter of deer. He had traveled 20 miles with this deer upon his back. The remainder of the deer he had left hung up in the woods. He saw six elk but did not try to shoot them as he knew he could not carry them out. He gave us a small piece of the meat, which we made into broth. Willie shot a duck which came in a time of need, for our supplies were rapidly diminishing.--Manuscript 11, 1873. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. April 11, 1985",
