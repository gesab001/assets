    "word": "While living in Granville, NSW, we were obliged to pass large stockyards on our way to Sydney. To these yards thousands and thousands of sheep and cattle are driven, to be purchased and killed by the butchers for consumption in the cities and towns. The sights I have witnessed in passing to and from Sydney have been heart-sickening. I read in our daily paper that in one locality three thousand sheep were killed daily, and as many as six thousand have been killed in a day. Large canneries are erected, in which the meat is canned, to be sent to Europe. Meat is frozen also, and sent to distant markets.",
