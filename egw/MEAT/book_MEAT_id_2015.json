    "word": "Meat-Eating. \n\n     I have never felt that it was my duty to say that no one should ever taste of meat under any circumstances. To say this when people \n\n\n                                   -81- \n\nhave been educated to live on flesh to so great an extent, would be to carry matters to extremes. I have never felt that it was my duty to make sweeping assertions. What I have said, I have said under a sense of duty, but I have been guarded in my statements, because I did not want to give occasion for any one to be a conscience for another.",
