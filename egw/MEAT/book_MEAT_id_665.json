It is for doing little things which are generally overlooked that they are rewarded. \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat,\" He says. \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\" (Youth's Instructor, Jan. 17, 1901). \n                                                                           347",
