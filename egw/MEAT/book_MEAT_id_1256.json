    "word": "K.--37--'01 \n     We are to be brought into connection with the masses. Should health reform be taught them in its most extreme form, harm would be done. We ask them to leave off eating meat and drinking tea and coffee. That is well. But some say that milk also should be given up. This is a subject that needs to be carefully handled. There are poor families whose diet consists of bread and milk, and, if they can get it, a little fruit. All flesh-food should be discarded, but vegetables should be made palatable with a little milk or cream or something equivalent. The poor say, when health reform is presented to them, \"What shall we eat? We can not afford to buy the nut foods.\" As I preach the gospel to the poor, I am instructed to tell them to eat that food which is most nourishing. I can not say to them, \"You must not eat eggs or milk or cream. You must use no butter in the preparation of food.\" The gospel must be preached to the poor, and the time has not yet come to prescribe the strictest diet.",
