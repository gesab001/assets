    "word": "\"Provide neither gold nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves; for the workman is worthy of his meat.

Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves, be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\"",
