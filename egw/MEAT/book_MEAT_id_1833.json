    "word": "THE EARLY HEALTH REFORMERS SOMETIMES MENTIONED OYSTERS AS THEY EXPLAINED WHY FLESH FOODS WERE HARMFUL. RUSSELL TRALL, IN HIS 1857 HYDROPATHIC COOKBOOK, SAID ALL MOLLUSCA, INCLUDING OYSTERS, WERE \"BAD ALIMENTS.\" PROBABLY MORE FAMILIAR TO ADVENTISTS WERE JAMES C. JACKSON'S COMMENTS ON OYSTERS, INCLUDED ALONG WITH HIS OTHER CRITICISMS OF FLESH FOODS IN AN ARTICLE JAMES AND ELLEN WHITE REPRINTED IN HEALTH: OR HOW TO LIVE. JACKSON OBJECTED TO THE OYSTERS BECAUSE THEY WERE SCAVENGERS. J. N. LOUGHBOROUGH SAID ALL SHELLFISH, INCLUDING OYSTERS, WERE OBJECTIONABLE AS THEY CONTAINED VERY LITTLE NUTRITION AND WERE DIFFICULT TO DIGEST. FINALLY, IN 1891, KELLOGG, REACTING ENERGETICALLY TO SOME FAVORABLE COMMENTS ON OYSTERS BY SCIENTISTS, CONDEMNED THE CREATURE AS DIFFICULT TO DIGEST, THE \"LOWEST OF SCAVENGERS,\" AND APT TO CONTAIN A DEADLY POISON, TYROTOXICON. COMPARED WITH THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL IN THE LITERATURE AGAINST PORK, HOWEVER, THE OBJECTIONS TO OYSTERS AND OTHER \"UNCLEAN\" MEATS IS SO MINISCULE AS TO HARDLY BE NOTICED.",
