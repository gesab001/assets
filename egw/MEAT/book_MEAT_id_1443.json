    "word": "The sacred responsibility rests upon the minister to watch for souls as one that must give an account. He must interest himself in the souls for whom he labors, finding out all that perplexes and troubles them and prevents them from walking in the light of the truth. Job says, \"The cause that I knew not, I searched out.\" This should be considered the important work of the ministry, even if it demands much painstaking effort and inconvenience, and gives much less time for sermonizing. This is home missionary work, and it is in no case to be neglected; for eternal interests are here involved. \n                                                                           4\nThe excuses of those who fail to do this work, do not relieve them of the responsibility. If they choose not to do it, they neglect the souls for whom Christ died, neglect their God-given responsibility, and are registered in the books of heaven as unfaithful servants. Does the minister work as did the Master to be a strength and a blessing to others when he shuts himself away from those who need his help? Those who neglect personal intercourse with the people, become self-centred, and need this very experience of placing themselves in communication with their brethren that they may understand their spiritual condition, and know how to feed the flock of God, giving to each his portion of meat in due season. Those who neglect this work make it manifest that they need moral renovation, and then they will see that they have not carried the burden of the work.",
