    "word": "The Lord has given clear light regarding the nature of the food that is to compose our diet: he has instructed us concerning the effect of unhealthful food upon the disposition and character. Shall we respond to the counsels and cautions given? Who among our brethren will Sign a Pledge to dispense with Flesh Meats, tea, coffee, and all injurious foods and become health reformers in the truest sense of the term? If we could be benefitted by indulging the desire for flesh meats, I would not make this appeal to you; but I know that we can not. They are injurious to the physical well being and we should learn to do \n                                                                           2\nwithout them. In this experience of backsliding from the principles of reform, our people have been repeating the experience of the children of Israel in the wilderness during the forty years of travel. Those who continue to follow their own course in this respect, eating, drinking, as they please, will gradually grow careless of the instructions the Lord has given regarding other phases of the present truth; they surely reap as they have sown. I have been instructed that the students in our schools are not to be served with flesh foods, or with food preparations that will cause disturbances of the stomach. Nothing that will serve to encourage a desire for stimulants should be placed upon the table. I appeal to young and old and middle aged. Deny your appetites of these things that are doing you injury. Serve the Lord by sacrifice. Let the good work begin at Washington and go forth from there to other places. I know whereof I am writing. If a temperance pledge providing for the abstinence from flesh foods, tea, and coffee, and some other foods, that are known to be injurious, were circulated through our ranks a great and good work would be accomplished. I Ask you at this Time, will you not Circulate Such a Pledge? The means saved by such a sacrifice if used for the furtherance of the cause of God would be blessed to the salvation of many souls. Let the children have a part in this work. We are all members of the Lord's family; and the Lord would have his children, both young and old, pledge themselves to deny appetite and to save the means needed for building meeting houses, and the support of missionaries. I am instructed to say to parents, place yourselves, soul and spirit on the Lord's side of this question. We need to ever bear in mind that in these days of probation we are on trial before the Lord of the \n                                                                           3\nuniverse. Will you not give up indulgences that are doing you such injury? Words of profession are cheap; let your acts of self-denial testify that you will be obedient to the demands that God makes of his peculiar people. Then put into the treasury a portion of the means that you save by your acts of your self-denial and there will be that which is to carry on the work of God.",
