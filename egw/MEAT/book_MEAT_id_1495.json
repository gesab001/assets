    "word": "Although Christ was suffering the keenest pangs of hunger he withstood the temptation. He repulsed Satan with the same scripture he had given Moses to repeat to rebellious Israel when their diet was restricted, and they were clamoring for flesh-meats in the wilderness, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" In this declaration, and also by his example, Christ would show man that hunger for temporal food was not the greatest calamity that could befall him. Satan flattered our first parents that eating the fruit which God had forbidden them, would bring to them great good, and would insure them against death, the very opposite of the truth which God had declared to them. \"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\" If Adam had been obedient, he would have known neither want, sorrow, nor death.",
