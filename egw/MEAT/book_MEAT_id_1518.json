    "word": "You place upon your table food which taxes the digestive organs, and excites the animal passions, and weakens the moral and intellectual. Rich food and flesh-meats are no benefit to you. Could you view just the nature of the meat you eat, the animals, when living, from which the flesh is taken when dead, you would turn with loathing from your flesh-meats. The animals whose flesh you eat, are frequently so diseased, that, if left alone, they would die of themselves; but, while the breath of life is in them, they are killed and brought to market. You take directly into your system humors and poison of the worst kind, and yet you realize it not. You love the indulgence of appetite. You have a lesson to learn: Whatsoever you eat or drink, or whatsoever you do, to do all to the glory of God.",
