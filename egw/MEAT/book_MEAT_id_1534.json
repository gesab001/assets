In Michigan we can do better in leaving salt, sugar, and milk, than many who are situated in the far West, or in the far East, where there is \n                                                                           45\na scarcity of fruit. There are but very few families in Battle Creek who do not use these articles upon their tables. We know that a free use of these articles is positively injurious to health, and, in many cases, we think if they were not used at all, a much better state of health would be enjoyed.
