    "word": "AFTER THE HEALTH REFORM VISION, OF COURSE, MRS. WHITE DID COME OUT AGAINST THE USE OF PORK, ARGUING THAT IT PRODUCED \"SCROFULA, LEPROSY AND CANCEROUS HUMORS.\" IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT SHE AND OTHER ADVENTISTS WHO WROTE AGAINST THE USE OF PORK UP UNTIL 1866, ARGUED STRICTLY FROM A HEALTH STANDPOINT. IN OTHER WORDS, JUST BECAUSE SOME BIBLICAL ARGUMENTS WERE USED TO REINFORCE THE BAN ON PORK, WE CANNOT CONCLUDE THAT AT THAT POINT ADVENTISTS WERE WELL ON THEIR WAY TO A FULL-BLOWN TEACHING ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CLEAN AND UNCLEAN MEATS.",
