    "word": "Thanksgiving Day will be respected, but how is it used? This day's privileges are turned out of their proper course and it is made a day of feasting and gluttony. Is it a day to set your tables with luxuries and load them down with sweetmeats and condiments for you and yours? Christ said, \"When thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.\" Luke 14:13, 14. Now, you may not be at a loss to number how many Thanksgivings are kept according to this rule.",
