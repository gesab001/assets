    "word": "God would have meat in His house. My heart is stirred with grief as I think of the way in which Brother Lacey was permitted to come from Melbourne to Sydney, sick and alone. Someone should have acted the good Samaritan, and put him into a first-class carriage, if there was one on the train, and if not, wait until there was one. The poor man was crowded into a car with smokers and rough, drinking men to spend his night in such company. Could Christians have seen him in his feebleness and done this? I seldom cry, but I did cry when I heard this, for I felt that it was done to Jesus in the person of His disciple. I do not know who did this, but I would say that should circumstances like this again occur, put the afflicted one into the best compartment, make it as comfortable as possible for him, and charge it to my account.",
