Once, when you were very sick,  the Lord gave me a message to save your life. You have been too strenuous in restricting your diet to certain articles of food. While I was praying for you, words were given  me for you to set you in the right path. The message was sent that you were to allow yourself a more generous diet.

You followed the directions given, rallied, and are still with us.",
