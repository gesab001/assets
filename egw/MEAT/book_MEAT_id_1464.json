    "word": "Disregarding Light \n\n     If things were as they should be in the households that make up our churches, we might do double service for the Lord. The light given me is that a most decided message must be borne in regard to health reform. Those who use flesh meat strengthen the lower propensities, and prepare the way for disease to fasten upon them. There are those among Seventh-day Adventists who will not heed the light given them in regard to this matter. They make flesh a part of their diet. Disease comes upon them. Sick and suffering as a result of their wrong course, they ask for prayers of the servants of God. But how can the Lord work in their behalf when they are not willing to do His will, when they refuse to heed His instruction in regard to health reform?--From a discourse by Mrs. E. G. White, General Conference of 1903, at Oakland, California.",
