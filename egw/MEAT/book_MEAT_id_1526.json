Our sanitariums are to be schools in which people of all classes shall be taught the way of salvation. In them the sick are to be taught to overcome the appetite for tea, coffee, flesh-meat, tobacco and intoxicating liquor of all kinds. In every one of our medical institutions the sick and suffering are to be pointed to the Saviour as their only hope. . . .",
