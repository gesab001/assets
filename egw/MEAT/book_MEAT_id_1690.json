    "word": "I have been plainly instructed by the Lord that flesh-meat should not be placed before the patients in our sanitarium dining rooms.

But, as stated before, if, after knowing that the flesh of animals cannot be placed on the dining-room tables, a few patients urge that they must have meat, cheerfully give it to them in their rooms.",
