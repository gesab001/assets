    "word": "Let every business transaction be done in righteousness, remembering that we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, \u201cFor it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. . . . Let not then your good be evil spoken of: for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\u201d Romans 14:11-17.",
