    "word": "There have been so many Christless sermons and so much theory that the poor flock is starving for food, meat in due season. This is my burden and I have no concern but that when we shall do the will of God, we shall know of the doctrine. But there must be far more praying and far more humility and meekness before we shall see the salvation of God among us as a people. Then we shall have a living testimony to bear that will reach hearts. We will have brokenness of hearts. All this cruel prejudice and unbelief that is so offensive to God will be swept away and all this hard spirit will be removed from us.",
