    "word": "There was Daniel, who stood before King Nebuchadnezzar, and who, when about to receive what was considered a favor, purposed in his heart that he would not accept it. He had an intelligent knowledge of the effect that the king's meat and wine would produce upon the human system; and he determined to adhere to the teachings of God forbidding their use by the Israelites, rather than receive the approbation of the king. The result was that God gave him great wisdom and understanding in all mysteries, so that at the end of the years of trial, when examined, he stood higher than any of the wise men in the kingdom.",
