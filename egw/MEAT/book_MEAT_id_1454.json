    "word": "The brother spoken of felt a lack in his system. He was not nourished. He thought meat would give him strength that he needed. Had he been suitably cared for, his table spread with food at the right time, of a nourishing quality, all the demands of nature would have been abundantly supplied. The butter and meat stimulate. These have injured the stomach and perverted the taste. The sensitive nerves of the brain have been benumbed, and the animal appetite strengthened at the expense of the moral and intellectual. Their higher powers, which should control, have been growing weaker; so that eternal things have not been discerned. Paralysis has benumbed the spiritual and devotional. Satan has triumphed to see how easily he can succeed in coming in through the appetite, and controlling men and women of intelligence, \n                                                                           80\ncalculated by the Creator to do a good and great work.",
