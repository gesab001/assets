    "word": "Physicians to Guide to Safe Paths \n\n\n     In the name of the Lord I testify that those who plead for indulgence of appetite in meat eating are the very ones who need most to reform, and bring themselves into line. Then they will give fewer directions for the patients to eat the flesh of dead animals because their own appetites crave meat. When the habits and tastes are brought into correct lines, it will be seen that light and truth are guiding the ones who are acting as guides to poor, weak, self-indulgent, intemperate souls.",
