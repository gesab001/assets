    "word": "\"When Israel was a child then I loved him, and called My son out of Egypt. As they called them, so they went from then: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burnt incense to graven images. I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.\"",
