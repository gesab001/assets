    "word": "MR No. 525 - The Effects of Meat Eating on Man\n\n     There is much that can be said on the question of Health Reform, and some persons are always ready to catch up the most objectionable features, and urge them upon the attention of those who are not properly enlightened in regard to the subject. But this course is not wise. At our campmeetings [in Australia], all classes of people are represented, and we need to guard every expression that bears upon any question of reform, else someone will catch at our words, and use them unwisely. The temperance question should be handled carefully.",
