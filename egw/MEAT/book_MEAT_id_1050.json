But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.\" The experience of Israel, referred to in the above words by the apostle, and as recorded in the one hundred fifth and one hundred sixth psalms, contains lessons of warning that the people of God in these last days especially need to study. I urge \n                                                                           99\nthat these chapters be read at least once every week.",
