    "word": "To those on His right hand He says, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.\"  The question is asked, \"Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in?  or naked, and clothed thee?  Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?\" He said, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" Thus that which is done to His needy brethren Christ accounts as done unto Himself.--Letter 30, 1884.",
