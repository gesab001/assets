    "word": "Chapter Thirty-Eight - Food Sales\n\n     Church-sponsored Food Sales Not Condemned.-- When the State fair was held in Battle Creek, our people took with them onto the grounds three or four cooking stoves and demonstrated how good meals might be prepared without the use of flesh meat. We were told that we set the best table on the ground. Whenever large gatherings are held, it is your privilege to devise plans whereby you can provide those who attend with wholesome food, and you are to make your efforts educational.--Manuscript 27, 1906.",
