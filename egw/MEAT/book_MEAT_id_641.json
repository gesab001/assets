    "word": "At Copperberg, where we spent the night after leaving Stockholm, we first had an opportunity to observe the Swedish table customs. In the dining-room of the hotel was a table having a large flower-pot in the center, and spread with bread, butter, cheese, cold salt meat, and various relishes and liquors.

Men and women help themselves to what they wish, and walk about the room, talking and eating. After this they order whatever dishes they desire, seat themselves at one of the small tables, and eat at their leisure.
