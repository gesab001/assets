UNLIKE THE CEREMONIAL LAWS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, WHICH POINTED TO CHRIST, OR THE CIVIL LAWS, WHICH GOVERNED THE THEOCRACY, THESE HEALTH LAWS WERE BASED ON NATURAL LAW AND THUS NOT MERELY APPLICABLE TO ONE AGE AND TIME. THUS EVEN AMONG ADVENTISTS WHO EAT MEAT, THESE UNCLEAN MEATS ARE AVOIDED. NINETEENTH-CENTURY ADVENTISTS, HOWEVER, DID NOT GENERALLY ACCEPT THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN CLEAN AND UNCLEAN MEATS BASED ON LEVITICAL LAW, EVEN THOUGH THEY CLEARLY CONDEMNED PORK.",
