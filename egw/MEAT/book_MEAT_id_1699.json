    "word": "How terrible it is when the acknowledgment of God is not made when it should be made! How sad to humble one's self when it is too late! Why, oh, why, do not men heed the invitation? The psalmist said, \"When Thou saidst, Seek ye My face, my heart said unto Thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek\" [Psalms 27:8]. The whole of this psalm is excellent, and should be placed in the reading and spelling lessons of the classes. The twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and seventy-eighth psalms tell of the rich blessing bestowed by God upon His people, and of their poor returns for all His benefits. The eighty-first psalm explains why Israel was scattered. They forgot God, as the churches in our land are forgetting Him today. Read the eighty-ninth, ninetieth, ninety-first, ninety-second, and ninety-third psalms. My attention has been called to these matters. Shall we not consider the Word of \n\n\n                               -266- \n\nthe Lord? These things were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come, and should they not be the objects of study in our schools? The Word of God contains instructive lessons, given in reproof, in warning, in encouragement, and in rich promises. Would not such food as this be meat in due season to the youth?",
