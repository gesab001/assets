    "word": "The large gatherings of our people afford us an excellent opportunity to illustrate our principles, to educate the people, not only by our words, but by our practice. Some years ago at these gatherings there was much said upon Health Reform, and the benefits of a vegetarian diet, but at the same time meat was furnished upon the tables at the dining tent. Faith without works is dead; and the instruction upon health reform, denied by the practice, did not make the deepest impression. At the campmeetings in Victoria and New South Wales, those in charge educated by practice as well as by precept. Although it has been but a few years since they received the truth, they took a noble stand for health principles. No meat was furnished at the dining tent, but fruits, grains, and vegetables, were supplied in abundance. I could not but be pleased; for precept and practice combined have a telling influence. Both believers and unbelievers asked questions in reference to the absence of meat, and then the reason was plainly stated, that meat is not the most healthful food. . . . \n\n\n                                    -421-",
