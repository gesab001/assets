    "word": "There are many things that need to be corrected and made wholesome and beautiful, so that the angels of God may not see preference for one and dishonor for another. Eating of the flesh of dead animals \n\n\n                                  -32- \n\nis deleterious to the health of the body, and all who use a meat diet are increasing their animal passions and are lessening the susceptibility of the soul to realize the force of truth and the necessity of its being brought into their practical life. This meat-eating question needs to be guarded. When one changes from the stimulating diet of meat-eating to the fruit and vegetable diet, there will always be a sense of weakness and a lack of vitality, and many urge this as an argument for the necessity of a meat diet. . . .",
