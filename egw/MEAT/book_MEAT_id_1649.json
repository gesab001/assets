    "word": "MR No. 624 - Make No Human Being Your Criterion\n\n     [Ellen G. White speaking:] Sister White has not had meat in her house or cooked it in any line, or any dead flesh, for years and years. And here is the [basis of some people's] health reform: \"Now I have told you Sister White did not eat meat. Now I want you not to eat meat, because Sister White does not eat it.\" Well, I would not give--I would not care a farthing for anything like that. If you have not got any better conviction--you won't eat meat because Sister White does not eat any--if I am the authority, I would not give a farthing for your health reform. What I want is that every one of you should stand in your individual dignity before God, in your individual consecration to God, that the soul-temple shall be dedicated to God. \"Whosoever defileth the temple of God, him will God destroy,\" Now I want you to think of these things, and do not make any human being your criterion.-- Ms 43a, 1901, p. 13.
