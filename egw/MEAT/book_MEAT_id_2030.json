    "word": "Results of Indulgence in Meat-Eating. \n\n                                       From MS. 1, '88 (P) \n\n\n     Shall meat become the staple article of food because those who are in responsible positions have been educating themselves to enjoy a meat diet? Shall the physicians be free to indulge their own perverted habits, to gratify appetites as they choose, and thus mold the sentiments of the institution? Shall those who have had great light, and who are professedly seeking to walk in that light, and to reflect the light, see their efforts counterworked by both precept and example in our sanitariums? In the name of the Lord I am charged to testify that those who plead for indulgence of appetite in meat-eating are the very ones who need to reform, and bring themselves into line. [Then] they will not give directions for the patients to eat the flesh of dead animals, because their own appetites crave meat. When the habits and tastes are brought into correct lines, it will be seen that light and truth are guiding the ones who are acting as guides to poor, weak, self-indulgent, intemperate souls.",
