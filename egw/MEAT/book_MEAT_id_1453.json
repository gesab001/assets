    "word": "One family in particular needed all the benefits they could receive by the reform in diet. Yet these very ones were completely backslidden. Meat and butter were used quite freely, spices were not entirely discarded. This family could have received great benefit from a nourishing, well-regulated diet. The head of the family needed a plain, nutritious diet. His habits were sedentary, and his blood moved sluggishly through the system. The benefit of healthful exercise he could not have like others, and, therefore, his food should be of a right quality and quantity. There had not been in this family the right management in regard to diet. There had been irregularity. There should have been a specified time for each meal, and the food should have been prepared free from grease in a simple form; but pains should have been taken to have it nutritious, healthful, and inviting. There has been in this family, as also in many families, a special parade made for visitors, many dishes prepared and frequently made too rich; so that those seated at the table \n                                                                           79\nwould be tempted to eat to excess. Then in the absence of company there was a great reaction, a falling off in the preparations brought on the table. The diet was spare, and lacked nourishment. It was considered not so much matter \"just for ourselves.\" The meals were frequently picked up, and the regular time for eating not regarded. Every member of the family was injured by such management. It is a sin for any of our sisters to make such preparations as mentioned, for visitors, and wrong their own families by a spare diet which will fail to nourish the system.",
