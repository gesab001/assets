    "word": "7 T.--124-126 \n     During the past night many things have been opened before me. The manufacture and sale of health foods will require careful and prayerful consideration.  {TSDF 98.10} \n     There are many minds in many places to whom the Lord will surely give knowledge of how to prepare foods that are healthful and palatable, if He sees that they will use this knowledge righteously. Animals are becoming more and more diseased, and it will not be long until animal food will be discarded by many besides Seventh-day Adventists. Foods that \n\n\n                                                                 99 \n\nare healthful and life-sustaining are to be prepared, so that men and women will not need to eat meat.  {TSDF 98.11}  \n     The Lord will teach many in all parts of the world to combine fruits, grains, and vegetables into foods that will sustain life and will not bring disease. Those who have never seen the recipes for making the health foods now on the market, will work intelligently, experimenting with the food productions of the earth, and will be given light regarding the use of these productions. The Lord will show them what to do. He who gives skill and understanding to His people in one part of the world will give skill and understanding to His people in other parts of the world. It is His design that the food-treasures of each country shall be so prepared that they can be used in the countries for which they are suited. As God gave manna from Heaven to sustain the children of Israel, so He will now give His people in different places skill and wisdom to use the productions of these countries in preparing foods to take the place of meat. These foods should be made in the different countries; for to transport them from one country to another makes them so expensive that the poor can not afford them. It will never pay to depend upon America for the supply of health foods for other countries. Great difficulty will be found in handling the imported goods without financial loss.",
