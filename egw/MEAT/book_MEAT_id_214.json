I eat but two meals a day, and still follow the light given me thirty-five years ago. I use no meat. As for myself, I have settled the butter question. I do not use it. This question should easily be settled in every place where the purest article cannot be obtained. We have two good milch cows, a Jersey and a Holstein. We use cream, and all are satisfied with this. \n     [USE OF CREAM IN PLACE OF BUTTER IN WHITE HOME-APPENDIX I:20, 23] \n     [USE OF BUTTER IN THE WHITE HOME-APPENDIX I:4] \n     [BUTTER NOT ON WHITE TABLE, BUT USED IN COOKING-APPENDIX I:14] \n     [BUTTER NOT ON TABLE IN WHITE HOME, AND NOT USED BY E.
