    "word": "Light has been given me that some of our ministers and leading workers are working against the light of health reform. They are indulging in the use of flesh meats and other harmful things. Those who for years have had the Testimonies before them are without excuse. Many need to make decided reforms, for those who have left our ranks make this an occasion of charging our people with unbelief in the Testimonies. God calls for thorough work on the part of professed believers, that he may be able to impress minds and hearts. \n                                        (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
