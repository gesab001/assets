    "word": "In California there is an abundance for the table, in the shape of fresh fruit, vegetables, and grains, and there is no necessity that meat be used. The weakness you experience without the use of meat is one of the strongest arguments I could present to you as a reason why you should discontinue its use. Those who eat meat feel stimulated after eating this food, and they suppose they are made stronger. After he discontinues the use of meat, he may for a time feel a weakness but when his system is cleansed from the effect of this diet, he no longer feels the weakness, and will cease to wish for that which he has pleaded for as an essential to strengthen him.",
