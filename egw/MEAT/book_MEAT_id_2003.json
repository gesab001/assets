    "word": "All who come to my table are welcome, but I place before them no meat. Grains, vegetables, and fresh and canned fruit constitute our table fare. At present we have plenty of the best oranges, also plenty of lemons. This is the only fresh fruit we can get at this season of the year, which is winter. We ride about five miles into the country to get this fruit, for which we pay three pence per dozen (six cents in American money). We enjoy picking the large golden fruit from the trees. Lemons in California, I should enjoy them far more than I do the oranges. I manage to keep a box of apples for my own use, but they are inferior to the apples we get in America. I pay $1.75 at this season of the year for a box of apples, holding less than a bushel.",
