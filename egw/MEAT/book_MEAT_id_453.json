    "word": "Christ will judge every man according to his works. He identifies His interest with His suffering, neglected children. He says to one class, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and\n200\nye gave me no drink:  I was a stranger, and ye took me not in:  naked, and ye clothed me not:  sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. . . .
