    "word": "I do hope that you, as a physician, will come to your senses, and will not, by precept and example, counterwork that which the Lord has given to enlighten minds and bring in thorough reforms. I am working earnestly on these lines and shall never cease to work against the practice of meat-eating. I have had opened before me the stumbling blocks which this diet question has been to your spiritual advancement, and what a stumbling block you have placed in the way of others and all because your own sensibilities were blunted through selfish gratification of appetite. For Christ's sake look deeper; study deeper, and act in accordance with the light God has been pleased to give you and others on this subject. I forbear writing more. I love your souls, and I want you both to accept every ray of light that the Lord has been pleased to give, and then cooperate with the Great Teacher by giving that light to others. \n\n\n                                    In love, \n\n\n                                            E.
