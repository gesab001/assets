    "word": "In the movements now in progress in the United States to secure for the institutions and usages of the church the support of the state, Protestants are following in the steps of papists. Nay, more, they are opening the door for the papacy to regain in Protestant America the supremacy which she has lost in the Old World. And that which gives greater significance to this movement is the fact that the principal object contemplated is the enforcement of Sunday observance\u2014a custom which originated with Rome, and which she claims as the sign of her authority. It is the spirit of the papacy\u2014the spirit of conformity to worldly customs,\n25\nthe veneration for human traditions above the commandments of God\u2014that is permeating the Protestant churches and leading them on to do the same work of Sunday exaltation which the papacy has done before them.",
