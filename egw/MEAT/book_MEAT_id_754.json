    "word": "Relating Faith to Life\n \n\n     Through visitation, ministers learn how to feed the flock.--It is in the labor out of the pulpit, among families, that the richest and most valuable experience is gained, and that the minister learns how he can feed the flock of God, giving to each his portion of meat in due season. If there is a backslider, the shepherd knows how to present the truth in such a manner that the soul will be convicted. He will leave the ninety and nine, and seek the lost sheep. But if the shepherd does not visit his flock, he knows not their condition, he knows not what truths to set before them, nor what is appropriate to their case.--Appeal and Suggestions to Conference Officers (Ph 2) 18.",
