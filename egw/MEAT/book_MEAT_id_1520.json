    "word": "The Old Testament needs to become our study-book more than it has been. We need to learn and obey the directions there given by the Lord when speaking to Moses in the pillar of cloud. The Most High ruleth in the heavens. His resources are without limit. His goodness and his love are manifested over all the works of his hands. The whole course of his providence attests his character and his merciful designs. \"The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfieth the desire of every living thing.\" \n\n\n                      -3-",
