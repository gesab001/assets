    "word": "\"Verily, verily I say unto you,\" Christ declared, \"He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life.\" Oh how few there are who reveal in their lives the principles of this life! They profess to believe the most sacred truth ever given to mortals, but in their lives they dishonor God. \"He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh My blood hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh My blood dwelleth in Me, and I in him. As \n\n\n                                    -264- \n\nthe living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.\"",
