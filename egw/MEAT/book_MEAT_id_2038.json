    "word": "We are not to make the use of flesh-meat a test. But we may and should consider the influence that professed believers who use flesh-meat have over other churches. Those who use flesh-meat disregard all the warnings that God has given concerning this question. They have no evidence that they are walking in safe paths. They have not the slightest excuse for eating the flesh of dead animals. God's curse is resting upon the animal creation. Many times when meat is eaten it decays in the stomach, and creates disease. Cancers, tumors, and pulmonary diseases are largely caused by meat-eating.",
