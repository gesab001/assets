    "word": "I have been calling to mind the light God has given me, and through me to you, on health reform. Have you prayerfully and carefully sought to understand the will of God in these matters? The excuse has been, that the outsiders would have a meat diet, but even if they had some meat, I know that with care and skill, dishes could be prepared to take the place of meat in a large degree. But if one performs the cooking whose main dependence is meat, she can encourage meat eating, and the depraved appetite will frame every excuse for this kind of diet. When I saw how matters were going,_____that if_____ had not meat to cook, she knew not what to provide as a substitute, and that meat was the principle article of diet,_____I felt that there must be a change at once. There may be consumptives who demand meat, but let them have it in their own rooms, and do not tempt the already perverted appetite of those who should not eat it.",
