{"word": "I speak to our people. If you draw close to Jesus and seek to adorn your profession by a well-ordered life and godly conversation, your feet will be kept from straying into forbidden paths. If you will only watch, continually watch unto prayer, if you will do everything as if you were in the immediate presence of God, you will be saved from yielding to temptation, and may hope to be kept pure, spotless, and undefiled till the last. If you hold the beginning of your confidence firm unto the end, your ways will be established in God; and what grace has begun, glory will crown in the kingdom of our God. The fruits of the Spirit are \"love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.\" If Christ be within us, we shall crucify the flesh with the affections and lusts. \n\n                                               -", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 148}
