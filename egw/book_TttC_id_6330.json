    "word": "There is need of prayer,--most earnest, fervent, agonizing prayer,--such prayer as David offered when he exclaimed: \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.\" \"I have longed after Thy precepts;\" \"I have longed for Thy salvation.\" \"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.\" \"My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto Thy judgments.\" This is the spirit of wrestling prayer, such as was possessed by the royal psalmist.",
