{"word": "Love Springs Forth Spontaneously When Self Is Submerged.--When self is submerged in Christ, true love springs forth spontaneously. It is not an emotion or an impulse but a decision of a sanctified will. It consists not in feeling but in the transformation of the whole heart, soul, and character, which is dead to self and alive unto God. Our Lord and Saviour asks us to give ourselves to Him. Surrendering self to God is all He requires, giving ourselves to Him to be employed as He sees fit. Until we come to this point of surrender, we shall not work happily, usefully, or successfully anywhere.--Lt 97, 1898. (6BC 1100, 1101.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 206}
