{"word": "Instruction to the Disciples \n\n     There are matters in the Testimonies that are written, not for the world at large, but for the believing children of God, and it is not appropriate to make instruction, warning, reproof, or counsel of this character public to the world. The world's Redeemer, the Sent of God, the greatest Teacher the children of men ever knew, presented some matters of instruction, not to the world, but to His disciples alone. While He had communications designed for the multitudes that thronged His steps, He also had some special light and instruction to impart to His followers which he did not impart to the great congregation, as it would neither be understood nor appreciated by them. He sent His disciples forth to preach, and when they returned from their first missionary labor and had various experiences to relate concerning their success in preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, He said unto them, \"Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile.\" In a place of seclusion Jesus imparted to His followers such instruction, counsel, cautions and corrections as He saw were needed in their manner of work; but the instruction He then gave them was not to be thrown \n                                                                           35\nbroadcast to the promiscuous company, for His words were designed for His disciples only.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 34}
