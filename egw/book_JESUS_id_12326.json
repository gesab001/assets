{"word": "But there are many among the colored people whose intellect has been too long darkened to be speedily fitted for fruitfulness in good works. Many are held in bondage to depraved appetite. \n                                                                           30 \nMany are slaves to debasing passions, and their character is of such an order as will not enable them to be a blessing. Sin and depravity have locked up their senses. They need help as much as the veriest heathen, and unless they have the right kind of help, they will be lost. But they may be taught to know God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness may shine into the darkened chambers of their mind. They need to catch a glimpse of God. It is their privilege to have eternal life, to be in union with God, and it is the privilege of those who know the truth to repeat the story again and again of God's wonderful love to man as manifested on Calvary's cross. The chain that is let down from the throne of God is long enough to reach into the lowest depths of sin. Hold up a sin-pardoning Saviour before the lost and lowly, for Jesus has made a divine interposition in their behalf. He is able to reach to the lowest depths and lift them up from the pit of sin, that they may be acknowledged as children of God, heirs with Christ to an immortal inheritance. They may have the life that measures with the life of God.--Review and Herald, Nov. 26, 1895. \n                                                                           31", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SW", "page": 29}
