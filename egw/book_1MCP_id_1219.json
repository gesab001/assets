{"word": "The Most Essential Knowledge.--Let the youth advance as fast and as far as they can in the acquisition of knowledge. ... And as they learn, let them impart their knowledge. It is thus that their minds will acquire discipline and power. It is the use they make of knowledge that determines the value of their education. To spend a long time in study, with no effort to impart what is gained, often proves a hindrance rather than a help to real development. In both the home and the school it should be the student's effort to learn how to study and how to impart the knowledge gained. Whatever his calling, he is to be both a learner and a teacher as long as life shall last.-- MH 402 (1905).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 368}
