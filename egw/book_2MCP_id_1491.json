{"word": "There is no requirement for you to take on a burden for yourself, for you are Christ's property. He has you in hand. His everlasting arms are about you. Your life has not been a life of sinfulness in the common acceptance of the term. You have a conscientious fear to do wrong, a principle in your heart to choose the right, and now you want to turn your face away from the briers and thorns to the flowers.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 809}
