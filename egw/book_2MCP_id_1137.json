{"word": "Temporary Relief, but the Mind Permanently Damaged.--No individual should be permitted to take control of another person's mind, thinking that in so doing he is causing him to receive great benefit. The mind cure is one of the most dangerous deceptions which can be practiced upon any individual. Temporary relief may be felt, but the mind of the one thus controlled is never again so strong and reliable. We may be as weak as was the woman who touched the hem of Christ's garment; but if we use our God-given opportunity to come to Him in faith, He will respond as quickly as He did to that touch of faith.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 706}
