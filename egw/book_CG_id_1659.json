{"word": "Comfort for a Bereaved Mother.--You inquire in regard to your little one being saved. Christ's words are your answer: \"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.\" Remember the prophecy, \"Thus saith the Lord: A voice \n                                                                           566\nwas heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted. . . . Thus saith the Lord: Refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears; for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to thine own border.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 565}
