{"word": "When we speak of faith, there is a distinction that should be borne in mind. There is a kind of belief that is wholly distinct from faith. The existence and power of God, the truth of His Word, are facts that even Satan and his hosts cannot at heart deny. The Bible says that \\93the devils also believe, and tremble\\94 (James 2:19); but this is not faith. Where there is not only a belief in God\\92s Word, but a submission of the will to Him; where the heart is yielded to Him, the affections fixed upon Him, there is faith\\97faith that works by love and purifies the soul.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 292}
