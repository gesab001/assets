{"word": "The Lord Jesus has given special directions as to what each of His \"little children\" is to do. When we pray, \"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us,\" do we do our part to answer this prayer? . . . If our brother has ought against us, we are to leave on the altar the gift we have brought to God, and be reconciled to our brother. Then we are to come and offer our gift. This is the only way in which we can keep in our hearts the peace of God.--Letter 12, Jan. 11, 1903, to Edson White.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 19}
