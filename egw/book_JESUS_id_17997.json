{"word": "It is the duty of everyone who professes to be a Christian to keep his thoughts under the control of reason and oblige himself to be cheerful and happy. However bitter may be the cause of his grief, he should cultivate a spirit of rest and quietude in God. The restfulness which is in Christ Jesus, the peace of Christ, how precious, how healing its influence, how soothing to the oppressed soul! However dark his prospects, let him cherish a spirit to hope for good. While nothing is gained by despondency, much is lost. While cheerfulness and a calm resignation and peace will make others happy and healthy, it will be of the greatest benefit to one's self. Sadness and talking of disagreeable things is encouraging the disagreeable scenes, bringing back upon one's self the disagreeable effect. God wants us to forget all these--not look down but up, up!", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 102}
