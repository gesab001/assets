{"word": "The hillsides and the fields were bright with flowers, and, pointing to them in the dewy freshness of the morning, Jesus said, \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.\" The graceful forms and delicate hues of the plants and flowers may be copied by human skill, but what touch can impart life to even one flower or blade of grass? Every wayside blossom owes its being to the same power that set the starry worlds on high. Through all created things thrills one pulse of life from the great heart of God. The flowers of the field are clothed by His hand in richer robes than have ever graced the forms of earthly kings. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 72}
