    "word": "The doctrine of the incarnation of Christ in human flesh is a mystery, \"even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations.\" It is the great and profound mystery of godliness. \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\" Christ took upon Himself human nature, a nature inferior to His heavenly nature. Nothing so shows the wonderful condescension of God as this. He \"so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.\" John presents this wonderful subject with such simplicity that all may grasp the ideas set forth, and be enlightened.",
