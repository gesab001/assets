    "word": "There are many who have no greater depth of faith and spiritual perception than had the disciples who forsook their Lord because their limited comprehension could not discern His words. The feeding upon the divine Word of God is the divine element which the soul needs in order to secure a healthy development of all its spiritual powers. In all our schools this Word is to be made the essence of education; it is this that will give sanctified strength, wisdom, integrity, and moral power, if it is brought into the experience. It is not the words of worldly wisdom, it is not the maxims of men, not the theory of human beings, but it is the Word of God. \n\n\n                                     -288-",
