    "word": "As we add the Christian graces we are being prepared to assist others in the divine life, and present to them the true principles of a religious life. I have made it my duty to instill into the minds of my children true principles that they may escape the corruption that are in the world in order to be successful in character building. We must begin at the very foundation and carry the mind upward in knowledge, for every capacity is to be used in glorifying God. In addition to the principles mentioned, temperance is enumerated.
