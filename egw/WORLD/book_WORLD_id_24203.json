    "word": "But shall not this prayer be answered by those who claim to believe the truth? Those who are truly joined to the Lord are controlled by one Spirit. They are stamped with the same image and superscription, and they give evidence that they are influenced by the same power, because they are joined to the Lord by the infinite Sacrifice made by Christ, that they might be knit together through the sanctification of the truth, in the bonds of love, perfect, heavenborn love. They have exchanged the heart of selfishness and sin for the heart that God gives. They are partakers of the divine nature. They may differ in speech and attitude, but they are guided by the same Spirit. No vainglory, no independent \"I\" comes in to take possession. The quarrelsome spirit ceases, and the world is given evidence of the power of true conversion.--Ms 29, 1906, pp. 5, 8. (\"That They All May Be One,\" March 8, 1906.) \n\nReleased March 17, 1978.",
