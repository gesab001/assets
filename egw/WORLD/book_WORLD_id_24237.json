    "word": "It is in order that those who love God and keep His commandments may have as little hindrance as possible in their advancement in the heavenward way that they are warned not to live in the cities. If by our restaurant work souls are not won to the truth, what is gained by entering so largely into this work, which must be done in the cities? Will the result justify the effort put forth? Will it pay for our young men and young women to spend their time and energy in providing and serving food for worldlings, while they make no effort to save their souls, no effort to lead them to see the light of present truth?--Letter 83, 1903, pp. 2, 3. (To H. W. Kellogg, May 13, 1903.)",
