    "word": "To Business Men and Ministers\nTake the books to business men, to teachers of the gospel, whose minds have not been called to the special truths for this time. The message is to be given \u201cin the highways,\u201d\u2014to men who take\n38\nan active part in the world's work, to the teachers and leaders of the people. Thousands can be reached in the most simple, humble way. The most intellectual, those who are looked upon as the world's most gifted men and women, are often refreshed by the simple words of one who loves God, and who can speak of that love as naturally as the worldling speaks of the things that interest him most deeply. Often the words well prepared and studied have but little influence. But the true, honest expression of a son or daughter of God, spoken in natural simplicity, has power to open the door to hearts that have long been closed against Christ and his love.",
