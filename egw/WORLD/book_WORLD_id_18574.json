    "word": "\"Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.\" \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise\" (Psalm 138:6; 51:17). Those who reveal the meek and lowly spirit of Christ are tenderly regarded by God. Nothing is unnoticed by Him. He marks their self-denial, their effort to uplift Christ before the world. Though these humble workers may be looked upon with scorn by the world, they are of great value in the sight of God. Not only the wise, the great, the beneficent, will gain a passport into the heavenly courts--not only the busy worker, full of zeal and restless activity. No; the pure in heart, in whose lips there is found no guile; the poor in spirit, who are actuated by the Spirit of an abiding Christ; the peacemaker, whose highest ambition is to do God's will--these will gain an abundant entrance. They are God's jewels, and will be among that number of whom John writes, \"I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, . . . saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth\" (Revelation 19:6). They have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. \"Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them\" (Revelation 7:15).",
