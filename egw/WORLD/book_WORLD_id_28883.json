    "word": "It is our privilege to believe in a personal Father, who has made a gift of His only Begotten Son, that a fallen world might repent, and accept of a personal Saviour, and be permitted to eat of the leaves of the tree of life. Thank God, we may uplift the Saviour before the people, as had been done at these meetings. The work will advance more and more, as we humble our hearts, and bring our wills in submission to God. Some will place themselves under Satan's rule, but we will not fail nor become discouraged.",
