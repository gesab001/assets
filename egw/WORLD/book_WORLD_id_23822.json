    "word": "The church in Fresno is composed of fragments of other churches. They are not ignorant of the Scriptures and the power of God; and if they are what God would have them be, they will be light-bearers to the world. This church is too large. Many ought to be out carrying the light of truth to those who are in darkness. If they neglect this, the woe of God will be upon them. Let them not tarry there, but go out as workers together with God.--Ms 1a, 1890, pp. 1, 3. (\"A Consecrated Ministry,\" February 13, 1890.)",
