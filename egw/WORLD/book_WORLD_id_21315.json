    "word": "In the face of what might be done, will the church sleep on, or will they feel the responsibility and the honor that is conferred upon them through the merciful providence of God, and gather up their hereditary trusts and the advantages of present light, and feel the necessity of rising to the urgent emergency that now presents itself before us? Oh, that all may arouse and manifest to the world that this is a living faith, that a vital issue is before the world, that Jesus will soon come! Let men see that we believe we are on the borders of the eternal world.",
