    "word": "There are laws of nature, but they are harmonious, and conform with all God's working; but when the lords many and gods many set themselves to explain God's own principles and providences, presenting to the world strange fire in the place of divine, there is confusion. The machinery of earth and heaven needs many faces to every wheel, in order to see the Hand beneath the wheels, bringing perfect order from confusion. The living and true God is a necessity everywhere.",
