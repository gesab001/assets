    "word": "Awake and see that at this time you must put on the beautiful robe of Christ's righteousness. \"Buy of Me,\" He says, \"gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich, and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed.\" What was the matter with Adam and Eve? They saw that they were naked. The covering of God was not enveloping them. God says, \"Buy of me.\" Well, what? Buy of Me My righteousness. \"Buy of Me gold tried in the fire, and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed.\" Are you clothed with it, or are you transgressing the commandments of God by your traditions and by the maxims of men? The righteousness of God never covers a soul all polluted with sin. John says, \"Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.\" Will you let Him take it away? You cannot bear your own sin. Christ says He will take your sin if you lay hold of the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour. Christ came and suffered for our sins \"that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Believe on Him as One upon whom the sins of the whole world are laid that man might have another trial. That trial we are having today. Shall it be that Christ shall not have died for us in vain? Shall we give to the world the evidence of the character of God \n\n\n                                    -324- \n\nbecause of our rectitude in keeping His commandments? May God help us to be loyal servants of His.--Ms 10, 1894, p. 10. (\"Keep the Commandments,\" February, 1894.) \n\nReleased June 21, 1978.",
