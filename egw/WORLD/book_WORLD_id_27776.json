    "word": "It was a wonderful thing for God to create man, to make mind. The glory of God is to be revealed in the creation of man in God's image, and in his redemption. One soul is of more value than a world. God created man that every faculty might be the faculty of the divine mind. The Lord Jesus Christ is the author of our being, and he is also the author of our redemption, and everyone who will enter the kingdom of God will develop a character that is the counterpart of the character of God. None can dwell with God in the holy heaven but those who bear his likeness. Those who are to be redeemed are to be overcomers; they are to be elevated, pure, one with Christ.",
