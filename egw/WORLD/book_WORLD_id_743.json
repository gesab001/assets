    "word": "Cain was very angry when God accepted the offering of Abel and gave no sign that He recognized the offering of Cain, because it left out the true figure, the representation of the world\u2019s Redeemer. But the Lord did not give up His way and will to conciliate Cain. He reasoned with him: \u201cWhy art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.\u201dLetter 16, 1897.",
