    "word": "If the elements existed in the church which existed in the life of Christ, there would be a firm union among His professed followers. The world is working against the church, seeking to weaken and destroy it. Shall the church imitate the world in this matter? Shall we as church members destroy confidence in other church members because they do not meet a certain standard? The message of the angel to us is, \"Press together, press together, press together.\" Let not Satan thrust himself between the members of the church. Do not give a stroke on the enemy's side of the question to weaken the influence of any member of the church. There will always be agents of the great adversary of souls who are doing their master's work of accusing those who profess to believe the truth. They will relate something that reflects upon the attitude and character of those who profess to be Christians.",
