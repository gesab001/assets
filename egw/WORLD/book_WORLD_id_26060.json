    "word": "A health institution is not established to conform to the selfish, intemperate customs of the world in eating or dressing, furnishing tables or rooms in an expensive style. It is to educate after the manner of Christ; so far as possible, it is to convert to correct principles all who shall patronize it. Those who are in responsible positions are not to become converted to the self-indulgent, extravagant principles of the world, for they cannot afford it; and if they could, Christlike principles would not allow it.",
