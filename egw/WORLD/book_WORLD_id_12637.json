IF IT HAD BEEN ESSENTIAL TO THE SALVATION OF MAN THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR AND HARMONIOUS UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE WORLD, THE LORD WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED THE DISAGREEMENTS AND DISCREPANCIES WHICH WE FIND IN THE WRITINGS OF THE BIBLE HISTORIANS, AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THESE LAST DAYS THERE OUGHT NOT TO BE SO MUCH CONTROVERSY REGARDING DATES.",
