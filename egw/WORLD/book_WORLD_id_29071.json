    "word": "Ease-loving men and women do not wish to be stirred up and obliged to change their habits and customs. They love their own way and opinions. They do not want their aspirations and ambitions broken in upon. They love self-indulgence in eating, drinking, and in display and lust for worldly gain. Time is not changing things for the better in this respect, but for the worse. Genuine reforms are always attended with loss, sacrifice and peril; opposition is provoked, calumny and hatred are called out, and the better rejected for the worse.",
