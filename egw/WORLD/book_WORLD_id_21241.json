    "word": "There are only two classes in our world, those who like Cain refuse to obey God, and those who like Abel steadfastly adhere to his commandments. Those who are now rooted and grounded in the truth range on one side, standing shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, in defence of the law of Jehovah. Those who are supporting falsehood in opposition to truth range on the side of the prince of darkness. So oppression is brought in. Those who have yielded themselves up to the will of Satan try to oppress God's servants, as Cain oppressed Abel.",
