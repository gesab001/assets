    "word": "John 15:17-21 points to the opposition between Christ and the world, and to the persecution inflicted upon Christ and His followers. . . . We want to know Christ, whom to know aright is life eternal. In John 15 He points to trials, to conflicts. He asks if you can endure the conflict; then He points to eternal realities and shows you the thousands of angels sent to be ministers to those who are heirs of salvation. Though He shows the armies arrayed against you, yet He tells you that you need not be discouraged, for the Captain of the Lord\u2019s host is with you, as with the Lord\u2019s people in Joshua\u2019s time. . . . What we want is to know how to fight the battle. The victory is not in the minister or the layperson, but in the Captain of the Lord\u2019s host who fights the battle for us. . . .",
