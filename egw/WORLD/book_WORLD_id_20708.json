    "word": "Those who will look at human souls in the light of the cross of Calvary, need not err regarding the estimate which should be placed upon them. The reason why God has permitted some of the human family to be so rich, and some so poor, will remain a mystery to men till eternity, unless they enter into right relations with God, and carry out his plans, instead of acting on their own selfish ideas, that because a man is rich, he is to be more highly respected that his poor neighbor. God makes his sun to shine on the just and on the unjust, and this sun represents Christ the Sun of Righteousness, who shines as the light of the world, giving his blessings and mercies, seen and unseen, to rich and poor alike. This principle is to guide our conduct toward our fellow men. The Lord is the teacher of the highest moral sentiments, the loftiest principles, and no man can deviate from these, and be guiltless. It is the highest insult to God's goodness to doubt whether he would be willing for us to impart to others the blessings, spiritual and temporal, which he has freely given us. \n\n\n                     - 29 -",
