    "word": "Christ went to these feasts because He wished to show those who were excluding themselves from the society of their fellow men, how wrong their course of action was. He wished to teach them that truth was given to be imparted to those who had it not. If they had truth, why keep it selfishly to themselves. The world is perishing for want of the living Truth.--Letter 67, 1905, pp. 3, 4. (To \"Brethren and Sisters of St. Helena, California,\" February 18, 1905.) \n\nReleased January 18, 1977.",
