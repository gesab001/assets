    "word": "This case is left on record for all the religious world. Let those who know the word of the living God beware of cherishing the errors of the world.

If these errors are introduced, they will mar the precious landmarks of truth.--Ms 47, 1898, pp. 12-14. (\"The Echo Office and Commercial Work,\" March 31, 1898.) \n\nReleased May 23, 1975.",
