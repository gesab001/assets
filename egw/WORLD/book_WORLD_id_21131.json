    "word": "God demands more of us than we are willing to give Him. None are to be forward and obtrusive, but we are to quietly live our religion with an eye single to the glory of God. Then we shall shine as lights in the world, without noise or friction. None need to fail, for One is with them who is wise in counsel, excellent in working, and mighty to accomplish His own designs. He works through His agents, seen and unseen, human and divine. This work is a grand work, and will be carried forward to the glory of God if all who are connected with it will make their work correspond to their profession of faith.",
