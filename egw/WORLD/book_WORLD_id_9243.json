    "word": "Truth Not to Be Spoken at All Times.--But few who have moved in the society of the world, and who view things from a worlding's standpoint are prepared to have a statement of facts in regard to themselves presented before them. The truth even is not to be spoken at all times. There is a fit time and opportunity to speak when words will not offend. The physicians should not be overworked and their nervous systems prostrated, for this condition of body will not be favorable to calm minds, steady nerves, and a cheerful, happy spirit.--3T 182 (1872).",
