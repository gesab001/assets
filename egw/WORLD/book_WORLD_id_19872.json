    "word": "There is only one true religion, only one way to heaven; only one light to illuminate the way as the pilgrims press on. As we follow on to know the Lord, we shall acknowledge at every step that Christ is the Light of the world, that He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and we shall find that the path that He bids us follow is \"as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day\" (Proverbs 4:18). . . .",
