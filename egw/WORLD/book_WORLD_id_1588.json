    "word": "The Danger of Looking to Men--A great crisis is coming upon us.  If men still yield to men, as they have been doing for the last fifteen years, they will lose their own souls, and their example will lead others astray.  God's soldiers must put on the whole armor of God.  We are not required to put on human armor, but to gird ourselves with God's strength.  If we keep God's glory ever in view, our eyes will be anointed with the heavenly eye salve; we will be able to look deeper, and see afar off what the world is.  As we discern its dishonesty, its craftiness, its selfish eye service, its pretense, and its boasting, its want of fair honest dealing in the ordinary intercourse of life, and its grasping covetousness, we can take our stand, by precept and example, to represent Christ, and convert souls from the world by our sound principles, our firm integrity, our hatred of all dissembling, and our holy boldness in acknowledging Christ.--Letter 4, 1896, pp. 13, 15, 16 (July 1, 1896 to Men in Responsible Positions).",
