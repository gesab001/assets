    "word": "Every act, however small, has its place in the great drama of life. Consider that the desire for a single gratification of appetite introduced sin into our world, with its terrible consequences. Unhallowed marriages of the sons of God with the daughters of men, resulted in apostasy which ended in the destruction of the world by a flood. The most trifling act of self-indulgence has resulted in great revolutions. This is the case now. Leading men are not circumspect. Like the children of Israel, they will not take heed to words of counsel, but follow their own inclination. They unite with a worldly element in attending gatherings where they will be brought into notice, and thus lead the way, and the people follow. What has been done once \n                                                                           79\nwill be done again by themselves and many others. Every step these take makes a lasting impression, not only on their own consciences and habits but upon those of others. This consideration gives awful dignity to human life.",
