    "word": "Advice to Medical Students \n     1086. I wish I could set before the medical student the true responsibility that rests upon him and his work. There is not one in one hundred who has a just sense of his position, his work, his accountability to God, and how much God will do for him if he will make him his trust. The very first lesson he should learn is that of dependence upon God. Make God your counselor at every step. The worldly and the nominal Christian may insinuate that in order to be successful you must be politic, you must at times depart from the strictest rectitude; but be not deluded. These temptations find a ready welcome in the heart of man; but I speak that which I know. Pamper not self. Throw not open a door for the enemy to take possession of the citadel of the soul. There is danger in the first and slightest departure from the strictest veracity. In your work, be true to yourself. Preserve your God-given dignity in the fear of God. There is in your case the necessity of getting hold and keeping hold of the arm of infinite power. --Counsel to Physicians and Medical Students, p. 23.",
