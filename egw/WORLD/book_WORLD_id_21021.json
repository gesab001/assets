    "word": "The Spirit of God with its restraining influence is being withdrawn from the earth. All may learn their lesson from the picture now presented in the condition of things in our world. They may see taking place the signs that Christ foretold. Those only who have humbled themselves, and kept their eyes fixed on God, will be safely hidden with Christ in God. And when Christ, who is their life, shall appear, they will appear with Him in glory.",
