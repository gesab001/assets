    "word": "The Lord Jesus loves those for whom he has given his life, and when worldly influences are allowed to come in between them and their Helper, when idols are chosen before Christ, when his appeals to the human soul are regarded with indifference, and there is no response, Jesus is grieved. He knows that they are meeting with great losses; for they are stumbling-blocks to sinners. They are not gathering with Christ, but scattering from him. But when through great affliction the Spirit of God touches their hearts, and they turn to him, he will hear their prayers. Christ knows the capabilities he has given to every soul to serve him for his present and eternal good. He desires that these souls shall not disappoint him. He wants them to shine in his kingdom. Those who will be the most highly honored are those who take up their cross daily, and follow Christ.",
