    "word": "Christ's perfect knowledge of human character fits Him to deal with minds. He knows just how to treat each soul. He judges not as man judges. He knows the real value of the material upon which He is working in fitting men and women for positions of trust. He will give wisdom and knowledge to those who are willing to be worked by the Holy Spirit, willing to be doers of the word and not hearers only, willing to uplift Christ before the world.",
