    "word": "The world is our field. God's children who feel a burden for the work of the message are to be allowed to work where the Spirit directs them. Let not a forbidding power be exercised to restrict them in their work. Let God accomplish His work through the agencies that He chooses. A great mistake has been made in the exercise of human authority in God's work, and I am bidden to proclaim the message: \"Break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free.\" I am bidden to say to church members, \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" (Isaiah 60:1.)",
