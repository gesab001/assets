    "word": "Again, our youth, both men and women, should be taught how to cook savingly, and to dispense with everything in the line of flesh foods. This is a very serious matter to the world. Thousands of human beings who subsist upon the flesh of dead animals, are suffering and dying from causes of which they are ignorant. By painstaking effort they can be taught to discriminate between a proper healthful diet and the use of flesh meats. No encouragement should be given in the training of our youth to prepare dishes which are composed in any degree of flesh meats; for this is pointing to the darkness and ignorance of Egypt rather than to the purity of health reform. Teach the students to prepare healthful drinks from grains suitably prepared to take the place of tea. This drink is unhealthful in its purest preparation; and it is so adulterated, mixed with other ingredients that resemble tea, that it has become a dangerous beverage. . . .",
