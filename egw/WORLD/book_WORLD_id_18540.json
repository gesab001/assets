    "word": "The design of God in giving us rich promises is stated by the apostle Peter--that we \"might be partakers of the divine nature.\" We must have earthly, worldly tastes transformed to the divine and heavenly. Heaven would be no heaven to you or to me if our tastes and our meditations and our temper were not Christlike. The pure and heavenly mansions which Christ has gone to prepare for His children are such as the redeemed alone can value by being made meet for them by the inward work of grace in their hearts.",
