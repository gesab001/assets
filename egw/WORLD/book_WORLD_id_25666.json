    "word": "The gospel--how precious it is! How important that it be presented to all! Rightly received, rightly understood, it makes all who receive it children of God, members of one family, giving them free access to Him as their Father. Those who receive the gospel are not self-centered. They love one another with an unselfish love. They allow nothing to bring in contention and strife. All heaven is pleased to aid them in their effort \"to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ; to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord\" [Ephesians 3:9-11].",
