    "word": "Those who love the Lord will look at Calvary, and will think of how the Lord of life and glory laid aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and, clothing His divinity with humanity, came to a world all seared and marred with the curse, to stand at the head of the fallen race, becoming their example in all things, bearing all the trials they have to bear, and enduring all the temptations they have to endure. He lived the life of the poorest, and suffered oft with hunger. \"The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests,\" He said, \"but the Son of man hath not where to lay His head\" [Matthew 8:20].",
