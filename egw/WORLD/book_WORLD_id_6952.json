    "word": "ON THE VERGE OF FULFILLMENT.\u2014We are living in a most solemn period of this earth\u2019s history. There is never time to sin; it is always perilous to continue in transgression, but in a special sense is this true at the present time. We are now upon the very borders of the eternal world and stand in a more solemn relation to time and to eternity than ever before. Now let every person search his own heart and plead for the bright beams of the Sun of \n189\nRighteousness to expel all spiritual darkness and cleanse from defilement.",
