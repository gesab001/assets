    "word": "Danger of Elation Through Success \n     The Lord has given abundant evidence of the truthfulness of His promises and threatenings. His people may trust His word. Will they then, in the face of light and evidence, follow a course of their own choosing, independent of God's ordained agencies. Even good men need to be guarded on every hand, lest they shall become so elated over the blessings God has given them that the applause and praise from worldlings, shall be as a stimulus for them to display their great wisdom and acquisitions.",
