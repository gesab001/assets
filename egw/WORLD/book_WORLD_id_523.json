    "word": "God\u2019s purpose for the children growing up beside our hearths is wider, deeper, higher, than our restricted vision has comprehended. From the humblest lot those whom He has seen faithful \n65\nhave in time past been called to witness for Him in the world\u2019s highest places. And many a lad of today, growing up as did Daniel in his Judean home, studying God\u2019s word and His works, and learning the lessons of faithful service, will yet stand in legislative assemblies, in halls of justice, or in royal courts, as a witness for the King of kings.  Education, p. 262.93 {CSA 64.10} \nTrue education does not ignore the value of scientific knowledge or literary acquirements; but above information it values power; above power, goodness; above intellectual acquirements, character. The world does not so much need men of great intellect as of noble character. It needs men in whom ability is controlled by steadfast principle.  Ibid., p. 225.94",
