    "word": "Satan and his angels are struggling for the mastery of the world, while the Prince of life and the angels of heaven are engaged in the battle, determined to rescue all those who would escape from the bondage of evil. God waits to see what those who have been enlightened by his truth will do. Again and again he has called for his ministers to be shepherds to the flock. He is now waiting for the co-operation of his human agents, waiting for them to minister to the sheep and lambs that are ready to die. O, will not the ministers of God, as consecrated, obedient children, take up one line of work after another as he presents it to them? Every herald of the gospel is to be a minister indeed. Every forgiven child of God is to be instructed by those who are laborers together with heaven, that he is to be a messenger to work in the same way as the Father and the Son are working, seeking to save the lost. All Christians are to lift up Jesus, and say, Behold him. \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\"",
