    "word": "The priests and scribes and rulers were so self-sufficient that they would not heed the words of Christ. They were convicted, their understanding was convinced, but they would not receive the Sent of God. They had been privileged with every temporal and spiritual advantage, but Christ looked upon them as rejecters of all the mercy and compassion and tenderness and love that He had come to the world to bring them. They turned away from the light and evidence that Christ had given them, and scorned His mercy. He looked upon them with yearning desire, and said, \"Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight\" (verse 21). He was grieved that the people most favored upon the face of the earth should be the very ones to deny Him and refuse His offer of everlasting life.",
