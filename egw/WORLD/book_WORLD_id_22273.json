He had separated Abraham from his idolatrous kindred, that the patriarch might train and educate his family apart from the seductive influences which would have surrounded them in Mesopotamia, and that the true faith might be preserved in its purity by his descendants, from generation to generation.\"-- \"Patriarchs and Prophets,\" pp. 141, 142.",
