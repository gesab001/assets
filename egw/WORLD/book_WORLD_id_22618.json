    "word": "The love of the world is terrible upon the Lord's people, whom he has commanded to watch and pray always, lest coming suddenly he find them sleeping. 'Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world; if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.\"",
