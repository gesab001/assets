To Ministers, Physicians and Teachers in Souther California: \n\nDear Brethren: \n     I have a message to bear to some who hold positions of responsibility in the Southern Calif. Conference. They are losing from their experience that true fervor which the presence of the Holy Spirit gives, and which would teach them to subdue self and walk humbly in the way of Christ. The responsible workers who will not become a humble follower of Christ will do great \n\n\n                             -267- \n\nharm to the cause of God by molding and fashioning the experience of the conference to a common, worldly standard. The sacred work that we handle, if performed in a spirit of consecration, will never cheapen the experience of a single soul.",
