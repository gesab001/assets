    "word": "There is a great work to be done. How shall we reveal Christ? I know of no better way to reveal Him than to go forth as missionaries to our world. I know of no better way than to take hold of the medical missionary work in connection with the ministry. Wherever you go, there begin to work. Take an interest in those around you who need help and light. You may stand and preach to those here who know the truth, you may preach sermon after sermon to them, but they do not appreciate it. Why?--Because they are inactive. Everyone who is able to get out and work should bring to the foundation stone, not hay, wood, or stubble, but gold, silver, and precious stones.-- MS. 150, 1901.",
