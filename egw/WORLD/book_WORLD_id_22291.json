    "word": "When you die to self, when you surrender to God to do your work, to let every ray of light which God has been giving you, shine forth in good works, you are not alone. God's grace stands forth to work with every effort to enlighten the ignorant and those who do not know that the end of all things is at hand: But he will not be your substitute to do your God-given work. Light may shine in abundance, but the grace given will not convert your soul only as it arouses you to cooperate with divine agencies. You are called upon to be active soldiers, to put on the divine armor, and put forth energies, divine power working with the human, to break the spell of the worldly enchantments.",
