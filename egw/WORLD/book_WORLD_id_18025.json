    "word": "Cultivate Faith and Love \n\n     There is a sad neglect of reading the Bible and searching it with humble hearts for yourselves. Take no man's explanation of Scripture, whatever his position, but go to the Bible and search for the truth yourselves. After hearing Jesus, the Samaritans said, \"Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.\" There is the mine of truth. Sink the shaft deep, and you will possess that knowledge which is of highest value to you. Many have become lazy and criminally neglectful in regard to the searching of the Scriptures, and they are as destitute of the Spirit of God as of the knowledge of His word. We read in the Revelation made to John, of some who had a name to live while they were dead. Yes, there are many such among us as a people, many who claim to be alive, while they are dead. My brethren, unless the Holy Spirit is actuating you as a vital principle, unless you are obeying its prompting, depending on its influences, laboring in the strength of God, my message to you from God is: \"You are under a delusion which may prove fatal to your souls. You must be converted. You must receive light before you can give light. Place  \n                                                                           156\nyourselves under the bright beams of the Sun of  Righteousness.\" Then you can say with Isaiah, \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" You must cultivate faith and love. \"The Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither  His ear heavy, that it cannot hear.\" Seek the Lord. Rest not until you know that Christ is your Saviour.",
