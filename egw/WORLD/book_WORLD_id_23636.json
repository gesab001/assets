    "word": "MR No. 282 - Mariology\n\n     That God who made the world is the only object to whom human beings should bow. God has not given to any human being the power to claim homage to themselves. He has given to none the power to become an object of worship. \"Again, the devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and he saith unto Him, All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth Him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.\"",
