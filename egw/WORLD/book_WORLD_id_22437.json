    "word": "We are to do missionary work. \"Ye are the light of the world.\" Why is it that Christ went out by the seaside and into the mountains?--He was to give the word of life to the people. They did not see it just that minute. A good many do not see it now, to take their positions, but these things are influencing their lives; and when the message goes with a loud voice, they will be ready for it. They will not hesitate long; they will come out and take their positions. There is a work that we have not done at our camp-meetings that ought to be done. \n\n                                               -",
