    "word": "We must ever be learning our great need, in order to appreciate our Saviour, and to make Him known to others. We can learn the depths of our transgression only by the length of the chain let down to draw us up. We should put our mental powers to the task to understand the fearful ruin to which sin has brought us, and we should seek to understand the divine plan by which we may be restored to the favor of God. That God's dear Son should have to come to our world to fight our battles for us that we might have strength to conquer in His name, should ever humble our proud hearts. It we look to the cross of Calvary, every boast will die upon our lips, and we shall cry, \"Unclean, unworthy of so great suffering, of so rich a price paid for my redemption.\"",
