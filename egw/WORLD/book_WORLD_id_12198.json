    "word": "Marring the Sacredness of the Work \n\n     I am charged to keep ever before our people--ministers of the gospel, and all who claim to be giving the light of truth to the world--the danger of marring the sacredness of God's work by allowing the mind to consent to a cheap interpretation of the way that God desires His work to be done. I have had special instruction given me regarding bringing human plans and devisings into the work of making known to the world the truth for this time.",
