And he says, \u201cBehold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone.\u201d Ministering angels were around about Him, waiting and eager to do His will, while the rainbow of God\u2019s promise, which was a token of His covenant with Noah, was seen by John encircling the throne on high\u2014a pledge of God\u2019s mercy to every repentant, believing soul. It is an everlasting testimony that \u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d It declares to the whole world that God will never forget His people in their struggle with evil.\u2014Manuscript 100, 1893.",
