    "word": "It is not enough to have a knowledge of Bible doctrines; the truth must be brought into your home life, and have a sanctifying influence upon the character. I cannot justify your inclinations to mix up with business matters, or say it is well for you to place the hand of your children in that of the world. You have your work to do, and if you do your duty as parents, and teach your children obedience and economy, you can support yourselves comfortably, without receiving presents from your brethren. This practice is a snare to you. Your conversation is too often prompted by selfishness; you seek to draw upon your brethren for sympathy and gifts. You should stand in the sight of God as a true, unselfish Christian, ready to practice as well as preach self-denial. I would not influence you to horde up means--it would be difficult for you to do this--but I would counsel you both to expend your money carefully, and let your daily example teach lessons of frugality, self-denial, and economy to your children. They need to be educated by precept and example.",
