    "word": "Those who believe unpopular truth have \n\n                    -12- \n\nmuch prejudice to meet everywhere in the world, and if Bible truth is to control our institutions, those employed in them must exemplify it in their own life. If they wish that the physical, intellectual, and moral standing of the institution shall be of the highest order, their own deportment must give evidence of this fact. They must plan and work constantly, and in the strength of Jesus seek so to elevate the character of the institution that it may receive the approval of Heaven.",
