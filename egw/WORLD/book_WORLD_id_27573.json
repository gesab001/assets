    "word": "Then our good Brother Smith gives the trumpet a counter blast, to make of none effect the warnings given in the same issue. Even if he did see that Elder Jones was too fast, what was his work? Go to Brother Jones, talk with him before his piece was inserted in the Review. This would be doing the works of Christ; but to put that article in the paper from Elder Jones and then Elder Smith write, as he has done, an article in the same issue, is entirely contrary to the light which the Lord has given me. Better let the articles of Elder Jones remain unpublished than, in the face of our enemies and the world which are watching to see something which they can use against believers, to present them in an unfavorable light to the world. This, I was shown, should not be done. That there will be alienation and disunion, I do not doubt, for this is the very work Satan is determined shall be, but which cannot be if the professed believers will heed the words of Jesus Christ.",
