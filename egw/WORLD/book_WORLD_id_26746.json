    "word": "Fathers and mothers, God has placed the younger members of His family under your care. Are you fitting them to live that life which measures with the life of God? Are you teaching them by example to hide the life with Christ in God, to believe in Him, to love Him? God said of Abraham, \"I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment\" (Genesis 18:19). Now, as then, this is what God requires from parents. He wants them to educate their children in such a way that when they go forth into the world, they will resist the temptations which beset them on every side.",
