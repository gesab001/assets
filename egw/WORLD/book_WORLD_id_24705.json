Christ is the light and life of the world. \"Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness\" (Psalm 112:4). All sin in darkness. When Christ came to this world, the Jewish rulers refused to accept His words. Wise in their own conceit, they declared that they knew all about the law of God. But Christ said to them, \"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God\" (Matthew 22:29). Darkness covered the earth and gross darkness the people. The human family, and even the Lord's chosen people, had to a large extent lost the knowledge of God. The Jewish priests were teaching for doctrine the commandments of men. God was misrepresented. False ideas prevailed in regard to His character and attributes. Christ came to this world, and the light shone forth into the darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not.",
