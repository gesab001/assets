    "word": "Every true, self-sacrificing worker for God is willing to spend and be spent for the sake of others. Christ says, \"He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.\" By earnest, thoughtful efforts to help where help is needed, the true Christian shows his love for God and for his fellow beings. He may lose his life in service; but when Christ comes to gather His jewels to Himself, he will find it again.--The Youth's Instructor, September 10, 1907. \n\n                                               -",
