    "word": "What a terrible deception is upon the minds of those who think that the world is growing better. Christ declares, \"As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.\" \"For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\" To just such a pass will the world come in rejecting the law of God.",
