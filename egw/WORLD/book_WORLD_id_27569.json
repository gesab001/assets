    "word": "Chap. 121 - Search the Scriptures\n-\nBy Mrs. E. G. White\n-\n     Christ has said: \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of me.\" The duty of searching the Scriptures is enjoined upon every son and daughter of Adam. Jesus says, \"And they are they which testify of me.\" The Father was revealed in the Son, and in studying Christ we shall learn of the Father. Then let us come to search the word of God with softened, subdued hearts, and read the testimony concerning our Lord and Master. Shall we not with intense interest seek to catch his spirit, copy his example, and breathe in the atmosphere of his presence, which is light and love? How eagerly should we study every lesson that fell from his divine lips! How we should cherish his instruction! How ardently we should seek to imitate his character and life, and press on to know more and more of the heavenly truths he taught. If we would but practice the truths he has given, we should perfect an experience that would be of the highest value to us, and to the world.",
