    "word": "PH169 - The Sufferings of Christ (1869)\n\n\n     \"God is love.\" His love manifested toward fallen man, in the gift of his beloved Son, amazed the holy angels. \"God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" The Son was the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person. He possessed divine excellence and greatness. He was equal with God. It pleased the Father that in him all fullness should dwell. He \"thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\" Yet he \"made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\"",
