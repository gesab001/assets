    "word": "Today the voice of mercy is calling, and Jesus is drawing men by the cords of His love; but the day will come when Jesus will put on the garments of vengeance. . . . The wickedness of the world is increasing every day, and when a certain line is reached, the register will be closed, and the account settled. There will be no more a sacrifice for sin. The Lord cometh. Long has mercy extended a hand of love, of patience and  forbearance, toward a guilty world. The invitation has been given, \"Let him take hold of my strength. . . .\" But men have presumed upon His mercy and refused His grace.",
