All this matter is thine, and it is only by thy constraint that we have put our hands to it. Defend us then, O Father!\" To Melancthon, who was crushed \n                                                                           169\nunder the burden of anxiety and fear, he wrote: \"Grace and peace in Christ!

He lives, he reigns; what fear, then, can we have?\"",
