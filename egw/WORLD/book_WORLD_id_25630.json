    "word": "Satan's last temptation of Christ at the beginning of the Saviour's ministry, was on the point of idolatry. Taking Jesus to an eminence, Satan caused the kingdoms of the world, in all their glory, to pass in panoramic view before Him. The traces of evil were hidden. Christ's eyes, so lately greeted by gloom and desolation, now gazed upon a scene of unsurpassed loveliness and prosperity. Then the tempter's voice was heard: \"All this power will I give Thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will give it. If Thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be Thine\" [Luke 4:6, 7].",
