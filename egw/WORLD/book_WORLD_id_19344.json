    "word": "\u201cLove not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\u201d Every moment of our time belongs to God, and we have no right so to burden ourselves with cares that there is no room in our hearts for His love. At the same time, we are to obey the injunction \u201cNot slothful in business.\u201d We are to labor, that we may have to give to him that needs. God does not desire us to allow our powers to rust through inaction. Christians must work; they must engage in business; and they can go a certain length in this line, and commit no sin against God.",
