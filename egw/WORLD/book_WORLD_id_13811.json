    "word": "The same creative energy that brought the world into existence is still exerted in upholding the universe and continuing the operations of nature. The hand of God guides the planets in their orderly march through the heavens.

He covers the heavens with clouds, and prepares rain for the earth. He makes the valley fruitful, and \"grass to grow \n                                                                           59\nupon the mountains.\" It is through his power that vegetation flourishes; that the leaves appear, and the flowers bloom.",
