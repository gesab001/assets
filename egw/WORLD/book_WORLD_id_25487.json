    "word": "My dear sister, our faith must increase. We must be more like Jesus in conduct and disposition. The light that shines on our path, the truth that commends itself to our intelligence, if obeyed will sanctify and transform the soul, but if disobeyed it will consume us. I see that there is danger on every side. We now have altogether too little time left to use it unprofitably. The knowledge of truth, the heavenly wisdom, spiritual endowments, are heaven's goods committed to us for wise improvement. We have no time or strength or goods to use for selfish purposes. By using God's gifts as sanctified and holy to advance his cause in the world, we can lay up treasure in heaven.",
