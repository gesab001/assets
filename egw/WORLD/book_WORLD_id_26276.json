    "word": "You may be called to act in councils. You may be called upon to go to foreign lands. Remember that you can never go beyond the domain of God. Give to what you do all the tact and strength of mind and heart, sinew and muscle. Do your best. You are not to seek to be controlled by men. Christ is your Master. Remember that you are only one member of the body, and that the different members of the body are to be controlled by the Holy Spirit. \"Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord\" [Isaiah 52:11]. Keep yourselves unspotted from the world. It is only as the different members of the body perform their several offices that the unity of the body is preserved. You can never be an independent whole. There is only one head. I am not your master. Call not any man master. You have one Master, who is in heaven.",
