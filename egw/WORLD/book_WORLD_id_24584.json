    "word": "The Place of Bible Study in SDA Schools--All the teachers in this school [South Lancaster Academy] should be men and women of principle and connected with God. We do not live in this world merely to please ourselves, but it is our duty, every one of us, to make the most of our God-given ability in order that we may uplift humanity that is around us. I have felt so interested in the education of the youth that I have said to individuals, \"If you will go to our schools I will see that your expenses are met,\" but I cannot feel at ease to do nothing in this matter.",
