    "word": "If we would press forward to \"the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,\" we must show that we are emptied of all self, and supplied with the golden oil which through the two golden pipes is communicated by the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth. God is dealing with us through His grace and providence. From eternity He has chosen us to be His obedient children. He gave His Son to die for us, that we might be sanctified through obedience to the truth, cleansed from all the littleness and cheapness of self. As a people, we are far behind. A personal work is needed, a personal surrender of self. We are to be controlled by the Holy Spirit. \"Ye are the light of the world . . . Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" God can only be honored when we who profess to believe in Him are conformed to His image. We are to represent to the world the beauty of holiness, and we shall never enter the gates of the city of God until we perfect a Christlike character. If we, with trust in God, strive for sanctification, we shall receive it. Then as witnesses for Christ, we are to make known what the grace of God has wrought in us.",
