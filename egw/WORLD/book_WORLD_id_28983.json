    "word": "At one time the disciples came to Jesus with the question, \u201cWho is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\u201d In answer Jesus called a little child unto Him, and setting him in the midst of them, said, \u201cVerily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth Me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in Me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\u201d",
