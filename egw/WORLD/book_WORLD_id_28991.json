    "word": "After Christ had been crucified and had risen from the dead, He remained with His disciples on this earth for forty days, giving them much instruction. The time came when He must ascend to His Father. But He promised to send them His Spirit as His successor. This Spirit was to be the guide and counselor of the church, teaching the disciples and bringing to their remembrance the things that Christ had told them. By the Spirit, under Christ\u2019s own dictation, there was given to the church its only code and charter. No human being could interfere to prevent Christ\u2019s followers from having the divine sufficiency of the Spirit. Said Christ, \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world.\u201d It has no principles in common with the world. Human patronage is not to be sought by it.",
