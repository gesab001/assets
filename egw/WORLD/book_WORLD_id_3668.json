    "word": "[From the first]  Mary  looked forward to the Messiah's reign on David's throne, but she saw not the baptism of suffering by which it must be won. Through Simeon [at Christ's dedication as a baby in the temple] it is revealed that the Messiah is to have no unobstructed passage through the world. In the words to Mary, \"A sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,\" God in His tender mercy gives to the mother of Jesus an intimation of the anguish that already for His sake she had begun to bear.--DA 56 (1898).",
