    "word": "Warning And Appeal \n\n     I was given words of warning and appeal to parents and ministers. Turning from one to another, I told them of their need of being converted daily, of the great importance of having the Spirit of God resting upon them. I said, My brethren and sisters, we have no time to spend in glorifying the enemy of all righteousness. Individually we are to strive for the mastery over all foolishness; we are to strengthen our souls by training our minds to dwell upon the sound, sensible truths of the word of God, that when the enemy seeks to take possession of the mind and to lead us into sin, we shall have strength to act like Christians. If we will let the Spirit of God make its impression on our minds, and will yield our lives to His control, we shall not dishonor God before the world.",
