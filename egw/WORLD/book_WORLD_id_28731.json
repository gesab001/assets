    "word": "Will our churches now arise, and awake to the situation? The representatives of Christ are to carry a burden for souls. Every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, is to hear the last message of mercy to a fallen world. When our churches shall arouse from their drowsy stupor they will have a better understanding of Bible truth, and they will be ready to devote their money to the cause of God, and to give themselves in earnest labor under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. God's people are His agents, appointed to proclaim the truth in all parts of the world. The heavenly agencies will act their part, and we must cooperate with them. Behold Christ, our Pattern, how He travailed in soul for the salvation of men.",
