    "word": "Lead to Fountains of Living Water.--He who seeks to quench his thirst at the fountains of this world will drink only to thirst again. Everywhere men are unsatisfied. They long for something to supply the need of the soul. Only One can meet that want. The need of the world, \"the Desire of all nations,\" is Christ. The divine grace which He alone can impart, is as living water, purifying, refreshing, and invigorating the soul.--DA 187 (1898).",
