    "word": "My heart aches almost to breaking as I see so much left undone that ought to be done. God's ambassadors are to maintain a living connection with Him. They are to enlarge their borders and extend their labors. Their lives are to be made pure, holy, ready for the great day soon to come upon the world. When they are imbued with the Spirit of the Master, they will see all around them souls . . . perishing in sin, and they will make every effort to save those nigh--even in their own households--and those afar off. Earnest, consecrated effort for those who are out of the fold leaves no time for criticism or questioning.",
