    "word": "Holiness is constant agreement with God. Shall we not strive to be that which Christ so greatly desires us to be\u2014Christians in deed and in truth\u2014that the world may see in our lives a revelation of the saving power of truth? This world is our preparatory school. While here we shall meet with trials and difficulties. Continually the enemy of God will seek to draw us away from our allegiance. But while we cleave to Him who gave Himself for us, we are safe.",
