    "word": "May God help us to humble ourselves in meekness and lowliness.  Christ laid aside His royal robe and kingly crown, that He might associate with humanity, and show that human beings may be perfect.  Clad in the garments of mercy He lived in our world a perfect life, to give us evidence of His love.  He has done that which should make unbelief in Him impossible.  From His high command in the heavenly courts He stooped to take human nature upon Him.  His life is an example of what our lives may be.  That no apprehension of God's greatness should come in to efface our belief in God's love, Christ became a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.  The human heart, given up to Him, will become a sacred harp, sending forth sacred music.  -- Letter 365, 1904.",
