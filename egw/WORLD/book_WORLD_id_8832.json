    "word": "The High Order of the Loma Linda School \n\n     Here we have ideal advantages for a school and for a sanitarium. Here are advantages for the students, and great advantages for the patients. I have been instructed that here we should have a school conducted on the principles of the ancient schools of the prophets. It may not be carried on in every respect as are the schools of the world, but it is to be especially adapted for those who desire to devote their lives, not to commercial pursuits, but to unselfish service for the Master.",
