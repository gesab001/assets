    "word": "Different Instrumentalities \n\n     The Lord has wrought with you, enabling you to act your part as His workman; but there are other workmen also who are to act their part as His instrumentalities. These help to compose the whole body. All are to be united as parts of a great machine. The Lord's church is composed of living, working agencies, who derive their power to act from the Author and Finisher \n\n\n                                -23- \n\nof their faith. The great work resting upon them is to be carried forward in harmony. God has given you your work. But He has other instrumentalities, and to them He has given their work, that all may become, through sanctification of the truth, members of Christ's body, of His flesh, and of His bones. Representing Christ, we act for time and for eternity; and men, even worldly men, take knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus, and have learned of Him.",
