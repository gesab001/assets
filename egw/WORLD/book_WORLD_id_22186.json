IN THE ARTICLE THAT FOLLOWS, WHICH APPEARED IN THE REVIEW ONE WEEK LATER, MEN IN POSITIONS OF TRUST ARE EXHORTED TO SUPERVISE THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES OF LAYMEN, SO THAT ALL WORK UNDERTAKEN MAY BE DONE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BRING HONOR AND BLESSING TO THE CAUSE OF GOD IN THE EARTH.] \n\n\n     The message of God for this time must go to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. The Bible \n                                                                           23\nis to be opened to the understanding of men, women, and children in every part of the world; but there is so great an indifference to the teaching of the holy word of God, that those who accept the responsibility of enlightening others, must themselves be enlightened, so that they may be able to present the truth with clearness, and in such a manner that it will be recommended to the best judgment of honest minds.",
