    "word": "The Lord is our leader and teacher. He charges us not to connect with those who do not acknowledge God. \"Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations.\" Connect with those who honor God by keeping His commandments. If the recommendation goes forth from our people that our workers are to seek for success by acknowledging as essential the education which the world gives, we are virtually saying that the influence the world gives is superior to that which God gives. God will be dishonored by such a course. God has full knowledge of the faith and trust and confidence that His professed people have in His providence.",
