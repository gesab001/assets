    "word": "Those men who lifted the burdens when the work went hard should be called into your councils. It is due them, and they should have a voice in the plans devised. There should be no confederacy formed with unbelievers, neither should there be a certain number who think as you think, and say \"amen\" to all your plans which you may propose. No confederacies are to be formed among our own people after the manner and customs of the world. I was shown especially the dangers in doing this. The world is not to be our criterion. Let the Lord work. Let the Lord's voice be heard. We are to bear a clear-cut message to the world. We are not to heed the counsels to follow the plans which will be suggested to make less prominent the special truths which are of vital interest, which have separated us out from the world and made us what we are.",
