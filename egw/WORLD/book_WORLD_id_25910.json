    "word": "When, in the fullness of time, Christ came to our world, it was darkened and marred by the curse of apostasy and spiritual wickedness. The Jews had wrapped themselves about with the dark mantle of unbelief. They kept not the commandments of God, but regarded as of more importance their own traditions. \"In vain do they worship Me,\" the Saviour declared, \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.\" And at another time He said, \"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.\" \n\n\n                                   -253-",
