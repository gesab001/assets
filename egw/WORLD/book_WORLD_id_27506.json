    "word": "The Lord has men prepared for the times. One does his part, carrying the people with him in reforms. The Lord raises up another who answers the call to duty saying, \"Here am I, send me.\" The Lord tests and proves him, to see if he will deal justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God. But when a man begins to regard his judgment as infallible, God can no longer use him as a representative of what a man who occupies a responsible position should be. The instruction God gives is that his people are ever to press forward and upward. Many cease to advance any further than their teachers carry them. This difficulty has existed in every age of the Christian world. God servants find their greatest success among a class who are not wedded to their previous teacher, who ask, Is this the way of the Lord?",
