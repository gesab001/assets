    "word": "There is a simplicity and purity in these lessons directly from nature that make them of the highest value to others besides the heathen. The children and youth, all classes of students, need the lessons to be derived from this source. In itself the beauty of nature leads the soul away from sin and worldly attractions, and toward purity, peace, and God, For this reason the cultivation of the soil is good work for children and youth. It brings them into direct contact with nature and nature's God. And that they may have this advantage in connection with our schools there should be, as far as possible, large flower gardens and extensive lands for cultivation.",
