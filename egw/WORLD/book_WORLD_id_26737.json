    "word": "Christ is the light of the world. In all that we do, let us walk in this light. In the Word of God our work is laid out before us. Let us not think that the Lord has given us talents to use in whatever way we please. Our talents are given us to hold in trust for Him. Our money is His. In its use we are to remember that Christ gave His precious life that we might have a probation in which to make a suitable preparation for the future life. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's\" (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20).",
