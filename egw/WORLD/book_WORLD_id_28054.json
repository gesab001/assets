    "word": "The Lord has permitted Brother John Wessels to go to Africa and Elder Daniells to accompany him. But I have been shown that there is in the hearts of the people of Africa something that will not be easily overcome, something that shows that some are not converted. They are not under the discipline of God. They do not accept God's way of doing them good, but choose rather their own way. They have yet to learn in the school of Christ His meekness and lowliness. They have yet to learn with Paul that to suffer for the sake of Christ \n\n\n                                   - 82 - \n\nis for their present and eternal good. Paul looked upon present suffering as not worthy to be compared with the glory which was to follow. He desired heavenly treasure rather than earthly advantages. He did not see anything in the world worth living for but the joy of doing the will of God from the heart, trusting all the consequences to God.",
