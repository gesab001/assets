    "word": "Let no one put aside this warning, and say, \"It does not mean me. I will not be disturbed by this excitable message.\" It is the evil servant who says in his heart, \"My Lord delayeth his coming.\" Professedly a servant of Christ, he does not, in words, deny that the Lord is soon to come; but his actions show that he puts off that day to a distant period. He guiltily presumes on the supposed delay; he becomes careless, and his works testify his unbelief. He adopts the maxims and conforms to the practices of the world.",
