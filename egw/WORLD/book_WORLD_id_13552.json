    "word": "One unsanctified act on the part of our Saviour, would have marred the pattern, and He could not have been a perfect example for us; but although He was tempted in all points like as we are, He was yet without one taint of sin. He proclaims His character by the mouth of the prophet saying, \"I am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth: for in these things I delight.\" All who profess the name of Christ should delight in these things, by conversation and conduct making manifest to the world that they are copying the Pattern. . . . Whoever believes in Christ must do the works of Christ. The Lord has been presented before them as one who exercises loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth, and these are the fruits that are borne by the genuine Christian. \n                                                                           149",
