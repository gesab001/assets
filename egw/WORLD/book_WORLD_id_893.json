    "word": "Satan is offering to every soul the kingdoms of this world in return for the carrying out of his will. This was the great inducement he presented to Christ in the wilderness of temptation. And so he says to Christ\u2019s followers, If you will follow my business methods, I will reward you with wealth. Every Christian is at some time brought to the test that will reveal any weak points of character. If the temptation is resisted, one has gained precious victories. . . . In Satan\u2019s last bold attempt to overcome Christ, the Saviour met him with the words \u201cGet thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\u201d Hitherto the Saviour\u2019s response to his temptations had been in the affirmative; now He commands the tempter to depart, and Satan leaves Him\u2014defeated where he had hoped for victory. . . .",
