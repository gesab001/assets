    "word": "To Awaken Inquiry \n\n     When thinking men find that our restaurants are closed on the Sabbath, they will begin to make inquiries in regard to the principles that lead us to close our doors on Saturday. In answering their questions, we shall have opportunity to acquaint them with the truth. We can give them copies of our periodicals and tracts, so that they may be able to understand the difference between God's people and the so-called Christian world. MS.-108-1902.",
