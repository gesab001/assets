    "word": "We would think, from the shadow that many walk in, that they had no Saviour. But I want to speak to those, and say \"Christ is risen! He is not in Joseph's new tomb, but He has arisen  and has ascended up on high to make intercession for us!\" We have a risen Saviour interceding for us, and we must walk in harmony with God. He is seeking to \"purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\" If we seek with all our hearts to be obedient children, conforming our will to the will of God, then the work can go forward in us without interruption. Let us not forget for one moment that we are living for the future immortal life, and let us put away from us everything like complaint and faultfinding. Let our words, our conversation, reveal to the world that we have a hope that is big with immortality.",
