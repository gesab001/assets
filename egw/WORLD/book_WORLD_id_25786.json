    "word": "God sees that the same course of action is being pursued the world over. Men and women come to the place where the road diverges: it is either right or \n\n\n                                    -363- \n\nwrong. Thousands upon thousands clothe themselves in what they suppose to be an impenetrable disguise, and choose the wrong. To make their course plain to others by abrupt disclosures would only cause a larger number to choose the side of wrong. Thus the wrongdoers would be sustained and many souls would be ruined. God does not force anyone. He leaves all free to choose. But He says, \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" The Lord will not write as wise those who cannot distinguish between a tree that bears thorn berries and a tree that bears olives.",
