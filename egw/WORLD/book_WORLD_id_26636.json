    "word": "Now, Jesus Christ did not come to man in His own divine character, but He clothed His divinity with humanity. He came to our world in His human nature, and in compassion, that you might behold Him. You could not behold Him if He had the light even of an angel. But He takes our nature; He comes right to us in the world to work for us, to teach all souls what we must do \n\n\n                                       -181- \n\nto be saved. And now every one of us can receive Him, believe on Him, if we will. But we are represented as the ten virgins, five of whom were wise and five foolish. They profess to be Christians. They profess to be religionists. But half of them have no oil of grace in their lamps, their hearts.",
