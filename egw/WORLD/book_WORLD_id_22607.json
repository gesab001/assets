George Gaskill. She knows not, by experimental knowledge, the ways of truth. Probation is passing and she is not ready. She is acquainted with the theory of the truth, but does not conform her life unto it. Love of friendship with the world is endangering her eternal welfare. Self is yet to be subdued. The will is to be brought in subjection. God calls upon her to be zealous and repent; to leave her unbelief, to cease dwelling upon the failures of others, and perfect her own ways before God or she will fail of everlasting life. She has a Christian character to form, a soul to save or lose, and she has no time to delay the work. Now, now, now, the Spirit invites. Resist not its voice. Self-righteousness will not save her in the reckoning day. She must possess the righteousness of Christ.",
