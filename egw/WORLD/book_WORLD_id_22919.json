    "word": "Those who are destroying the earth have had a long probation. For six thousand years God has borne with the ignorance and wickedness of men. In every possible way He has tested and tried them, seeking to lead them to return to their loyalty, and be saved. But they refuse to listen to His entreaties. War and bloodshed have been, are still, and will continue to be. \n                                                                           62\nWar is popular. To kill and destroy is in the sight of the world to be brave, worthy of a reward.",
