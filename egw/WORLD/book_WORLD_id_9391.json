    "word": "God Deals Plainly.--But our Lord does not deceive us. He does not say to us, \"Do not fear; there are no dangers in your path.\" He knows there are trials and dangers, and He deals with us plainly. He does not propose to take His people out of a world of sin and evil, but He points them to a never-failing refuge. His prayer for His disciples was, \"I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\" \"In the world,\" He says, \"ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world\" (John 17:15; 16:33).--SC 122, 123 (1892). \n\n480",
