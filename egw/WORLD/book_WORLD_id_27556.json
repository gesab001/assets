    "word": "God grant that his converting power may be felt throughout this large assembly. O, that the power of God may rest upon the people. What we need is daily piety. We need to search the Scriptures daily, to pray earnestly that by the power of the Holy Spirit God may fit every one of us up to work in our place in his vineyard. No one is prepared to educate and strengthen the church unless he has received the gift of the Holy Spirit. No minister is prepared to labor intelligently for the salvation of souls, unless he is endowed by the Holy Spirit, unless he is feeding on Christ, and has an intense hatred of sin. There are some who are regarded as laborers together with God, who have no connection with God, and are sinning against him. They are not led by Christ; another is their captain. They do not wait upon the Lord, and renew their strength in Christ; they have no burden for souls. What kind of account will these false shepherds have to meet in the judgment? What will they have to say to justify their inefficient, unconsecrated lives? What excuse can they render to the God of heaven? Was there not a sufficient sacrifice made in their behalf, that they might become partakers of the divine nature, and escape the corruptions that are in the world through lust? We are to make intelligent work for eternity. This is the object for which we should labor.",
