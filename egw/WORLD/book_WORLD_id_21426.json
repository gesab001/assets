    "word": "Preparation of Heart Needed. \n\n     At these gatherings we must ever remember that two forces are at work. A battle unseen by human eyes is being waged. The army of the Lord is on the ground seeking to have souls. Satan and his synagogue are also at work, trying in every possible way to deceive and destroy. The Lord bids us, \"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Day by day the battle goes on. If our eyes could be open to see the good and evil agencies at work, there would be no trifling, no vanity, no jesting, or joking. If all would put on the whole armour of God and fight manfully the battles of the Lord, victories would be gained which would cause the kingdom of darkness to tremble. \n\n\n                     - 12 -",
