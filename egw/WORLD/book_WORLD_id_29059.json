    "word": "It is a desirable thing to do God service; but it is not always an easy thing. The world is against us. At times, the way seems to be hedged up, and Satan seems to get hold of the mind. And, too often, when the brethren of the tempted one should be wise, the human side of their characters is manifested instead of the godly side, It is lamentable. If these tempted ones had not, by a course of teaching, been educated to look to men, they would turn their face toward God, and trust in God. They need greater strength than human power, greater strength than their own.",
