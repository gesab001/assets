    "word": "Work to Develop Symmetrically.--The health reform is as closely related to the third angel's message as the arm to the body; but the arm cannot take the place of the body. The proclamation of the third angel's message, the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus, is the burden of our work. The message is to be proclaimed with a loud cry, and is to go to the whole world. The presentation of health principles must be united with this message, but must not in any case be independent of it, or in any way take the place of it. . . . There must be a well-balanced, symmetrical development of the work in all its parts. . . . I would have the health books occupy their proper place; but they are only one of many lines in the great work to be done. The Lord has sent His message to the world in books that contain the truth for the last days.",
