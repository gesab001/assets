    "word": "The coming of Christ is near and hasteth greatly. The time in which to labor is short, and men and women are perishing. . . . We need the converting power of God to take hold of us, that we may understand the needs of a perishing world. The burden of my message to you is: Get ready, get ready to meet the Lord. Trim your lamps, and let the light of truth shine forth into the byways and the hedges. There is a world to be warned of the near approach of the end of all things. . . .",
