    "word": "When His mission as a teacher should be ended, He must be delivered into the hands of wicked men and be subjected to every insult and torture that Satan could inspire them to inflict.

He must pass long hours of agony so terrible that angels could not look upon it, but would veil their faces from the sight. He must endure anguish of soul, the hiding of His Father\u2019s face, while the guilt of transgression\u2014the weight of the sins of the whole world\u2014should be upon Him.",
