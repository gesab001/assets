    "word": "The words and law of God written in the soul, and exhibited in a consecrated, holy life, have a powerful influence to convict the world. Covetousness, which is idolatry, envy, the love of the world, will be rooted from the heart that is in obedience to Christ, and it will be their pleasure to deal justly, to love mercy, and walk humbly before God. Oh! how much is comprised in this walking, humbly before God. The law of God, if written on the heart, will bring into subjection the mind and will to the obedience of Christ.",
