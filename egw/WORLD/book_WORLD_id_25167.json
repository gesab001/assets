    "word": "It is the duty of every true follower of Christ to reflect light to the world. God has laid upon us a responsibility for the souls of those who are unsaved. As an ambassador of Christ I would tell you, brethren, that if you talked more of the merits of Christ, if you engaged more frequently in humble prayer, and said less to your brethren of the weaknesses of others, you would advance in spirituality and be far ahead of where you now are. You must give the precious plant of love some chance to grow. Jesus has said, \"By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another\" (John 13:35).--Letter 1c, 1890, pp. 2-7. (Written May 28, 1890, from Crystal Springs, California, to Brethren Atwood and Pratt.)",
