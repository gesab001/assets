    "word": "Attitude of Searchers for Truth. \n\n     Be guarded, and search the Scriptures with all reverence; for they contain wonderful truth. Through the truth you are to be renewed, reshaped in character, that you may bear the imprint of the divine. There is light, precious light, for all whose hearts are softened and subdued by the Spirit of God. They will receive joyfully the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. Whatever God has written is for the instruction of all. That which he saw essential to inspire holy men to write, is for your edification. Only practise the words of truth, and you are safe; you will be God's light-bearers to the world. Study the word of God, critically and prayerfully, that you may understand the great vital truths concerning the salvation of the soul. Self-confidence and self-assumption will never prove a saving power to you. In humility, diligently seeking the grace of God, dig deep, know what is truth, and that your foundation is sure. The truth must be kept before the people; and you need constantly to realize your dependence upon God.",
