We owe it to every member of the human family, whether black or white, high or low, to treat him with kindness, and to manifest interest for his soul. As members of one family we are all brethren, and we are connected by ties of relationship with unconverted persons. We are not to withdraw ourselves and refuse to associate with the people of the world but, relying firmly upon God, expecting His divine assistance, we are to go forth to live a consistent Christian life, and \n\n\n                                     -181- \n\nto win others by precept and example.",
