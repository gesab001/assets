    "word": "The loss of one soul is represented as a catastrophe in comparison with which the gain of a world sinks into insignificance. . . .In Jerusalem is represented every soul who neglects present privileges and refuses the light that God sends them. Have the counsels of God been cherished? Have the entreaties and warnings of His servants been accepted? Has remonstrance been heeded? Oh, that we may individually improve the golden moments of this \u201cthy day\u201d lest the word shall come, \u201cbut now they are hid from thine eyes.\u201d If light shines in our day we are to receive the light, appreciate it, and walk in the light without waiting to see whether prominent people or scholars accept it. . . .",
