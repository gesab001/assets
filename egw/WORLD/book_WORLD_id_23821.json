    "word": "That night the angel of the Lord stood by my side, and talked with me. He said that the church at Fresno would have to learn many things; that many were there who ought not to be there; that all must draw nearer to God, find their strength in Him, and not in man. They must use their own powers, that God has given them, and let their light shine forth in good works. He said that they had placed man where God should be; but when they should make God alone their trust, then He would educate them, and lead them in safe paths. Then they would be lightbearers to the world, and would not walk in darkness. But now they were trusting in man to do the work for them which the Lord God of Israel alone could do.",
