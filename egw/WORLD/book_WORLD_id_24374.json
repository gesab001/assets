    "word": "The Lord would have you gird on the armor, and have full confidence that while the world is teeming with error of all kinds, those who have the light of truth will be given wisdom from on high. Keep close to the side of Jesus. The time has come when the Lord says, \"Go forward and cultivate the abilities I have entrusted to you.\" The world is filled with false sentiments. Lift up the banner of Bible truth. The cause of God needs men who are making spiritual advancement. In the future more than in the past, sensational and absurd theories will be put forth. We are to keep close to the Word, that we may have clearness of mind to discern these fallacies.",
