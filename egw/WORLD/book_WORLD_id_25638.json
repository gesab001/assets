    "word": "Nicodemus was a witness of this scene. He greatly desired an interview with Jesus, but shrank from seeking Him openly. Learning by special inquiry the Saviour's place of retirement in the Mount of Olives, he waited until night, and then went to Jesus to learn more fully in regard to His mission, and to seek for evidences that would prove that Christ was indeed the promised One. This night interview was productive of rays of light that have had a powerful influence upon the world.--Ms 60, 1902. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Nov. 5, 1987. Entire Ms.",
