    "word": "The world is in co-partnership with the professed Christian churches in making void the law of Jehovah. God's law is set aside; it is trampled underfoot; and from all the loyal people of God the prayer will ascend to heaven, \"It is time, O Lord, for Thee to work: for they have made void Thy law.\" Satan is making his last and most powerful effort for the mastery, his last conflict against the principles of God's law. A defiant infidelity abounds.",
