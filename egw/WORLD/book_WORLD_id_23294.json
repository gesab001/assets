    "word": "\"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\" (Mark 8:36, 37). \"For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works\" (Matthew 16:27). The reward will not be according to his faith but according to his works, and the life will be eternal with Jesus. In order to obtain this we must be obedient, and not only apply our powers, but if necessary give our lives.",
