    "word": "It is time that we as Christians reach a much higher standard. God forbid that any institution that He has planted shall become \n\n\n                    -16- \n\na means of decoying souls, a place where iniquity is taught. Let all learn in the school of Christ, meekness, purity, and lowliness of heart. Let them hang their helpless souls on Jesus. Live in the light shining from the oracles of God. Educate mind and heart to pure, elevated, holy thoughts. \"Be ye holy in all manner of conversation.\" Whatever influence you have, direct it to exalting Jesus, and not self. Unless you do this, you are a false guide, leading souls away from the Truth, the Life, the Light of the world; and the more pleasing and attractive your manners, the greater the harm you do.",
