    "word": "Truth With Freshness of a New Revelation-- Truth never languished on His lips, never suffered in His hands for want of perfect obedience to its requirements. \"To this end was I born,\" Christ declared, \"and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.\" And the mighty principles of truth fell from His lips with the freshness of a new revelation. The truth was spoken by Him with an earnestness proportionate to its infinite importance and to the momentous results depending on its success.--5BC 1148.",
