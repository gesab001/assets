    "word": "The messages are not to be sunk out of sight and the means in the treasury exhausted by a work for the most-abandoned classes. These are not to be repulsed; they are to be encouraged to reform and be converted. But all the time and talent and means are not to be devoted to work such as that which has been started in Chicago, which has absorbed so much of the Lord's money. God has said that churches are to be established all over the world. Every effort is to be made to turn souls from error to truth. But work for the destitute is not to be taken up and managed as it has been in Chicago. The same time and means, used otherwise, would have done much to proclaim the truth which must be given to our world. Men and women would have been called out from the world to witness to Christ's words, \"Ye are the light of the world.\"--Letter 91, 1900, pp. 8, 9.
