    "word": "We often hear of disasters in theaters and pleasure resorts, where lives are lost, and many are wounded, and perhaps made life-long sufferers. But these things do not arrest the pleasure-seekers. They rush on, thirsting for excitement, and often in the very act they too are hurled into eternity; without a moment's warning, their probation is ended; and what has been their life record? Can Christ say of these, \u201cWell done, good and faithful servants\u201d? Multitudes are vainly seeking happiness in worldly amusements. They crave something which they have not. They are spending their money for that which is not bread, and their labor for that which satisfieth not. The hungry, thirsting soul will continue to hunger and thirst so long as it partakes of these unsatisfying pleasures. Oh that they would listen to the voice of Jesus, \u201cIf any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\u201d Those who drink of the living water will thirst no more for frivolous, exciting amusements. Christ, the well-spring of life, is the fountain of peace and happiness.",
