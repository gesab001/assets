    "word": "The whole treasure of heaven is at our command in our work of preparing the way of the Lord. God has made it possible by giving us the cooperation of heavenly angels, for our work to be a wonderful, yes, a glorious success. But success will seldom result from scattered, individual effort. The influence of every church member is required. The influence of ministers and workers is needed to prepare the way for the light and glory of God. Every soul who claims to believe in Jesus, God lays under tribute to Himself. The prayer of Christ for His disciples was, \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one\" (John 17:20-22). \n                                                                           747",
