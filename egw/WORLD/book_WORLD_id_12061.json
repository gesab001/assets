    "word": "Christ came in human form to show the inhabitants of the unfallen worlds and of the fallen world that ample provision has been made to enable human beings to live in loyalty to their Creator. He endured the temptations that Satan was permitted to bring against Him, and resisted all his assaults. He was sorely afflicted, and hard beset, but God did not leave Him without recognition. When He was baptized of John in Jordan, as He came up out of the water, the Spirit of God, like a dove of burnished gold, descended upon Him, and a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\" (Matthew 3:17). It was directly after this announcement that Christ was led by the Spirit into the wilderness. Mark says: \"Immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness. And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts\" (Mark 1:12, 13). \"And in those days he did eat nothing\" (Luke 4:2).",
