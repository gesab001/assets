    "word": "MR No. 816 - Nearness and Delay of the Second Advent\n\n     Our work is to prepare a people for the soon coming of the Lord. We are to be in the world, but not of the world. Let us consider the work before us. Never forget, we are laborers together with God. We are to prepare the way of the Lord. Let us bind ourselves to His sacred work. We have no time to lose in inaction. We must provide facilities for the accomplishment of the missionary work that the Lord has said must be done. We must teach old and young, men and women, to lay up treasure beside the throne of God.--Letter 25, 1902, p. 7. (To Those in Responsible Positions in the Southern Field, February 5, 1902.)",
