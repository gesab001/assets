    "word": "Chap. 69 - A Missionary Training\n\n\nWith such an army of workers as our\nyouth, rightly trained, might furnish,\nhow soon the message of a crucified,\nrisen, and soon-coming Saviour might\nbe carried to the whole world!\n\nEducation a Fitting for Service\n\n     The true object of education is to fit men and women for service by developing and bringing into active exercise all their faculties. The work at our colleges and training schools should be strengthened year by year, for in them our youth are to be prepared to go forth to serve the Lord as efficient laborers. The Lord calls upon the youth to enter our schools and quickly fit themselves for active work. Time is short. Workers for Christ are needed everywhere. Urgent inducements should be held out to those who ought now to be engaged in earnest effort for the Master.",
