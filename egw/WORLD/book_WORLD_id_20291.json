    "word": "Influence of the Life of Christian Service.--The Christian's life will testify that he is governed by other laws than those which the world obeys--laws of a higher order than those that control the lovers of the world. The will of God, our Creator, is to be made manifest in us, not only in the name we bear, but in our life of self-denial. We are to give evidence that we are influenced and controlled by unselfish principles. All our purposes and pursuits should stand in distinct contrast to the selfishness of the world.",
