    "word": "There is a world before Bro. and sister Ross, lying in wickedness. Their field is a large one. They have plenty of room to try their gifts and test their calling without entering into other men's labors, and building upon a foundation they have not laid. Bro. and sister Ross have been very slow to obtain an experience in self-denial. \n                                                                           79\nThey have been slow to come up to health reform in all its branches. The churches are in advance of them in the denial of appetite. Therefore they cannot be a benefit to the churches in this direction, but rather a hindrance.",
