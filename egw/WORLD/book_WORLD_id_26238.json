    "word": "The Saviour says, in His message to the churches, \"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white; for they are worthy\" [Revelation 3:4]. These souls overcame by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. Amid the moral pollution that prevailed on every hand, they held fast their integrity. And why? They were partakers of the divine nature, and thus they escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. They became rich in faith and heirs to an inheritance of more value than the gold of Ophir. Only a life of constant dependence upon the Saviour is a life of holiness.--Letter 22, 1890. \n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nApril 12, 1990. Entire Letter.",
