    "word": "It must have been a very severe ordeal for our Saviour to lay aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and clothe His divinity with humanity, coming to this world as a little child, to live a life of obedience in behalf of the sinful race. Lest we should make a mistake in regard to what the redeemed must be, He came to give in His life a revelation of the character God requires His children to form. He came that we might have an example of what human nature may become by receiving Him as a perfect Saviour. He came to show us that we may be Christlike. \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name\" (John 1:12). He came to reveal the character of God. He took human nature upon Him in order that He might come to this world as a man, and as a man live a life of obedience.",
