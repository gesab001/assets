    "word": "But my burden did not leave me. I had a message to the believers in New York City, that all who are truly converted unto the proclamation of the third angel's message must not present to the world, to angels, and to men, division in the place of unity. The truth of God sanctifies the receiver to be a channel and representative of His grace to the world and to angels and to men. All who are called [are] prepared and aided by one Agency. From one great and powerful Source there would be love and unity; their Christian instrumentality to be proved and to glorify God in love and harmonious action, each strengthening the other and each taking diligent heed to his own course of action in the great and solemn work before them in presenting the sanctifying truth to souls ready to die.",
