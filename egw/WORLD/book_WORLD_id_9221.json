    "word": "Avoiding Presumptuous Acts.--There are those who recklessly place themselves in scenes of danger and peril \n\n\n                                                   25 \n\nand expose themselves to temptations, out of which it would require a miracle of God to bring them unharmed and untainted. These are presumptuous acts, with which God is not pleased. Satan's temptation to the Saviour of the world to cast Himself from the pinnacle of the temple was firmly met and resisted. The archenemy quoted a promise of God as security, that Christ might with safety do this on the strength of the promise. Jesus met this temptation with Scripture: \"It is written, . . . Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\" In the same way Satan urges men into places where God does not require them to go, presenting Scripture to justify his suggestions.--RH, Apr 8, 1880.
