    "word": "Those who are foolish enough to invest their money in these speculative schemes, supposing the ones engaged in this business to be honest, are under a delusion which will work disaster to themselves. Many will keep up their dishonest speculation, although their names are on the church books, until they are bankrupt in this world and for eternity. These things are a disgrace to the truth. And church-members have permitted these things to exist in their midst because they have not had their eyes anointed \n\n\n                        [17] \n\nwith the heavenly eye-salve, that they may discern the wily workings of Satanic agencies, to rob the widows and the fatherless in their speculation.",
