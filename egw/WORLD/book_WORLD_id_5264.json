    "word": "The intelligent, conscientious care of our bodies is due to our Heavenly Father, who \"so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" We are individually the property of Christ, His purchased possession.
