    "word": "Here is an important lesson for every follower of Christ. The Redeemer of the world speaks to the youth. Will you listen to His words of heavenly instruction? He presents before you themes for thought that will ennoble, elevate, refine, and purify, but which will never degrade or dwarf the intellect. His voice is speaking to you: \"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.\" \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" If the light of God be in you, it will shine forth to others. It can never be concealed.",
