    "word": "I hope Brother Wilcox will be a truly converted man. This is his great need at the present time. He wants meekness, he wants humility, he wants genuine piety, and without it he is as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. His soul and your soul need the indwelling of Jesus. Whether the world is round or flat will not save a soul, but whether men believe and obey means everything.--Letter 43, 1887. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nMay 9, 1991. Entire Letter.",
