    "word": "You Are a Letter; Deliver It!--The apostle Paul says to the disciples of Jesus, \"Ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ,\" \"known and read of all men.\" In every one of His children Jesus sends a letter to the world. If you are Christ's follower, He sends in you a letter to the family, the village, the street, where you live. Jesus, dwelling in you, desires to speak to the hearts of those who are not acquainted with Him. Perhaps they do not read the Bible or do not hear the voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see the love of God through His works. But if you are a true representative of Jesus, it may be that through you they will be led to understand something of His goodness, and be won to love and serve Him.--Steps to Christ, p. 119.",
