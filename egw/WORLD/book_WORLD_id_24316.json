    "word": "But in the name of Christ I would entreat you to stop this work. Give men a chance to exercise their individual judgment. Men who follow the leading of others and are willing that another should think for them, are unfit to be entrusted with responsibility. Our leading men are remiss in this matter. God has not given to special ones all the brain power there is in the world. Men in responsible positions should credit others with some sense, with some ability of judgment and foresight, and look upon them as capable of doing the work committed to their hands.",
