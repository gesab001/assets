    "word": "\u201c\u2018I then said, \u201cNathaniel you are very sick. You may die in two hours, and unless God interposes, you cannot live two days,\u201d He said, very calmly, \u201cOh, not so soon as that, I think.\u201d He immediately arose from the bed, sat in the rocking-chair, and commenced talking. He began back to the time when he was converted, and told how much he enjoyed, and how afraid he was of sinning, and then when he began to forget God, and lose the blessing, how high his hopes were raised. He \u201cmeant to be a man in the world, to get an education and fill some high station.\u201d And then he told how his hopes had died, as afflictions had pressed heavily upon him, and how hard it was for him to give up his expectations. He said he felt he could not have it so, he would be well, he would not yield to it. Then he spoke of his coming to Rochester. How trying it was to have us wait \n300\nupon him, and to be dependent. \u201cIt seemed to me,\u201d said he, \u201cthat the kindness of you all was more than I could bear, and I have desired to get well to pay you for all this.\u201d He then spoke of his embracing the Sabbath. Said he, \u201cAt first I was not willing to acknowledge the light I saw. I wished to conceal it, but the blessing of God was withheld from me until I acknowledged the Sabbath. Then I felt confidence towards God.\u201d Said he, \u201cI love the Sabbath now. It is precious to me. I now feel reconciled to my sickness. I know that it is the only thing that will save me. I will praise the Lord, if he can save me through affliction.\u201d",
