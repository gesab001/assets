    "word": "Sanitariums are to be so established and conducted that they will be educational in character. They are to show forth to the world the benevolence of heaven, and though Christ's visible presence is not discerned in the building, yet the workers may claim the promise, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" He has assured us that to those who love and fear Him, He will give power to continue the work He began on this earth. He went about doing good, teaching the ignorant, and healing the sick. And His work never stopped with an exhibition of His power to heal physical disease. He made each work of healing an occasion of implanting in the heart the divine principles of His love and benevolence. Thus His followers are to work.",
