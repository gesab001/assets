    "word": "The Lord loves His people, and would lead them step by step onward under the banner of truth, the third angel's message. . . . In these last days we have the benefit of the wisdom and experience of past ages. The men of God, saints and martyrs, have made confession of their faith, and the knowledge of their experience and their burning zeal for God is transmitted to the world in the living oracles. . . . This hereditary trust has been gathered up by faithful witnesses that the bright light shining upon them in the knowledge of God might enlighten those living in these last days; and while they appreciate this light, they will advance to greater light. . . .",
