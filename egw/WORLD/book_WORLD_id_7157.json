    "word": "God spared not His only-begotten Son. To show the depth of His love for man, He delivered Him up for us all. \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). Behold Him dying on the cross. Behold Him who was equal with God, mocked and derided by the mob. Behold Him in Gethsemane, bowed under the burden of the sins of the whole world.",
