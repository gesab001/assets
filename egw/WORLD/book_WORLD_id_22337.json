    "word": "It is a solemn thing to be entrusted with talents. It is a wonderful responsibility. I have some very decided statements to make to all who claim to follow the Lord, to be faithful and obedient to his word. The word of the Lord has come to me upon the subject of systematic benevolence. The tithing question is a matter that is so plainly stated in God's word that not one living soul need to misunderstand it. The Lord has given me talents to use to his name's glory; but he makes one reserve. \n\n\n                      -2- \n\nTo Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden he said, \"Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it.\" Here was the test that was to prove the loyalty of Adam and Eve. But they did the very thing the Lord had forbidden, and as a result the flood-gates of woe were opened to our world.",
