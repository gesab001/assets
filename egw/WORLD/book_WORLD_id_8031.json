    "word": "The Word of God is to be our spiritual food. \"I am the bread of life,\" Christ said; \"he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.\" The world is perishing for pure, unadulterated truth. Christ is the truth. His words are truth, and they have a greater value and a deeper significance than appears on the surface. . . . Minds that are quickened by the Holy Spirit will discern the value of these sayings. . . .",
