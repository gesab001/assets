    "word": "A Definite Mission.--My heart aches as I see those who profess to be looking for the Saviour devoting their time and talents to circulating books that contain nothing \n                                                                           121\nconcerning the special truths for this time--books of narrative, books of biography, books of men's theories and speculations. The world is full of such books; they can be had anywhere; but how can the followers of Christ engage in so common a work, when there is crying need for God's truth on every hand? It is not our mission to circulate such works. There are thousands of others to do this, who as yet have not sufficient knowledge of anything better. We have a definite mission, and we should not turn from it to side issues. Men and means are not to be employed in bringing before the people books that have no bearing upon the present truth.--Manual for Canvassers, p. 51. (1902)",
