    "word": "The exact time of Christ's second coming is not revealed. Jesus said, No man knoweth the day nor the hour. But He also gave signs of His coming, and said, \"When ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.\" He bade them, as the signs of His coming should appear, \"Look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.\" And in view of these things the apostle wrote: \"Ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day.\" Since we know not the hour of Christ's coming, we must live soberly and godly in this present world, \"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\" . . .",
