    "word": "MR No. 1338 - Reform Needed at St. Helena Health Retreat; Identify with Fellow Christians, not with Worldlings; an Appeal to Dr. Burke\n\n     I have learned of Dr. Burke's resignation. I am sorry indeed for this, for he is repeating his first experience. I see now, as ever I have, the danger of binding up in connection with, or in association in labor, with worldlings, professors or nonprofessors, who are in opposition to our faith, and who have no faith in the testimonies of reproof which the Lord sends. Not the least good can come of such a combination, or marriage, in business, believers with unbelievers. There can be in this our work no more combination than oil can mix with water. Here is where the delusion and deception have come in. The world has been placed in front to carry out the workings of the enemy by his own subjects, the children of disobedience, and the children of God have been belittled, suspicioned, accused, and defamed by the agents of the wicked one.",
