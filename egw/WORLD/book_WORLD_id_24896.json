    "word": "Many who have moved into Fresno have eagerly drunk of the spirit of speculation in order to obtain money fast. Worldly business tries the character, and puts it to the test. It brings out the real, valuable virtues of the man, and develops an upright youthful training, or else it brings out natural, objectionable hereditary tendencies, and exposes him to sharp thrusts of the enemy. God will not work a miracle to preserve any one of you on the enemy's battleground, where He has never indicated that it was your duty to go. He has followed you with warnings and reproofs to keep you away from dangerous ground, where your soul would be imperiled.",
