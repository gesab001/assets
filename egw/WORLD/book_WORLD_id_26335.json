    "word": "The Lord your Saviour commissions me to give you this message: Cherish love, for love is of God. Harshness and accusation are of the devil. Cultivate love, and express it with kindly, tender, sympathetic words, spoken in simplicity and Christlikeness. Talk cheerfully and hopefully, whether you feel hopeful or not. Talk faith and love and \"adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.\" We cannot better glorify God than by being witnesses of the fact that through the power of His rich grace there is peace and joy in the Saviour. Cheerful, holy endeavor to keep the unity of the faith presents heavenly credentials to the world that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world as the Saviour of men.--Letter 16a, 1895. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nDecember 13, 1990. Entire Letter.",
