    "word": "The great Head of the church, who has chosen His people out of the world, requires them to be separate from the world. He designs that the spirit of His commandments, by drawing His followers to Himself, shall separate them from worldly elements. \n                                                                           378\nTo love God and keep His commandments is far away from loving the world's pleasures and its friendship. There is no concord between Christ and Belial.",
