    "word": "Even so, the mighty cleaver of truth has taken out a people from the quarry of the world and is fitting this people, who profess to be the children of God, for a place in His heavenly temple. We want the cleaver of truth to do its work for us. . . . We are here as probationers, and we must pass under the hand of God. All rough edges and rough surfaces must be removed, and we must be stones fitted for the building. We are brought into church capacity with defects of character, but we must not retain them. We must be fitted and squared for the building. We must be \u201clabourers together with God,\u201d for we are \u201cGod\u2019s husbandry,\u201d we are \u201cGod\u2019s building.\u201d In view of this we must see that the temple is not defiled with sin. We should be lively stones, not dead ones, but live ones that will reflect the image of Christ. We must be worshipers in spirit and in truth.\u2014Manuscript 49, 1886 (Manuscript Releases, vol. 3, pp. 230-232).",
