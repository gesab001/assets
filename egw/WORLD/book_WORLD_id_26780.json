    "word": "What is the \"much fruit\" that we must bear? It is fruit of a heavenly nature, the result of lives sanctified by the Holy Spirit of God. When we abide in Christ, and Christ abides in us, we shall be men and women of prayer, of truth, men and women who carry themselves circumspectly before God and before the world. Daily we shall draw from Christ the strength we need to work the works of God. This is what the world needs--a manifestation of the power of truth in Christian characters. What we need is faith in the Word of God, and with true faith we shall have the living witness that our ways please God. Of what worth is religion to us if when we approach God we cannot have the evidence in ourselves that He hears and answers prayer?",
