    "word": "Christ assumed humanity with all its humiliation and service, that He might cut man loose from Satan's chariot car as a bond slave. He knew that the service of Satan can bring only wretchedness and misery and distress in its train. The sinner is a stranger to repose and rest. The sinner says, I want my freedom. By this he would get rid of all restraint by casting aside the law of God. But it is this desire that has made the world what it is today--corrupt as in the days of Noah, and polluted as the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.",
