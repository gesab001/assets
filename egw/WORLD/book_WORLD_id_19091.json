    "word": "Christians are to love one another, as Christ has loved them. Upon the manifestation of this love hinges the world's recognition of the truth of the gospel. It was for this that Christ prayed in the last prayer He offered. Christians must not act like unruly children. Before the world those who claim to be God's children must give evidence that they have left behind them the childish ways of their unconverted life.--Letter 179, Nov. 19, 1902, to C. P. Bollman, editor of the Southern Watchman, published in Nashville, Tennessee.",
