    "word": "A writer has said that \"envy's memory is nothing but a row of hooks to hang up grudges on.\" There are many in the world who consider it an evidence of superiority to recount the things and persons that they \"cannot bear,\" rather than the things and persons that they are attracted to. Not so did the great apostle. He exhorts his brethren: \"Whatsoever things \n                                                                           56\nare honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\"",
