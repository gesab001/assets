    "word": "\"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Those who believe in a crucified Redeemer, who receive Him as their personal Saviour, have eternal life. Christ drank the bitter cup in their behalf. He took upon Himself the guilt of every sinner then in the world and every sinner that should afterward be born. As He bowed His soul to receive the load of guilt, He cried, \"If it be possible, let this cup pass from Me.\" He made a voluntary sacrifice. He contemplated the burden of sin. He alone could measure its magnitude.",
