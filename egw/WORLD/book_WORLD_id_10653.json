    "word": "Clergy of Other Denominations\n\n\n     God's servants are to approach the ministers of other denominations.--More work should have been done for those in high places. Those who give the last message of mercy to a fallen world are not to pass by the ministers. God's servants are to approach them as those who have a deep interest in their welfare, and then plead for them in prayer. If they refuse to accept the invitation, tell the Master about it, and then your duty is done.--RH May 8, 1900.",
