    "word": "That aged prisoner [Paul], standing chained to his soldier guard, presented nothing imposing or attractive in his dress or appearance, that the world should pay him homage. Yet this man, apparently without friends or wealth or position, had an escort that worldlings could not see. Angels of heaven were his attendants. Had the glory of one of those shining messengers flashed forth, the pomp and pride of royalty would have paled before it; king and courtiers would have been stricken to the earth. . . . All heaven was interested in this one man, now held a prisoner for his faith in the Son of God.\u2014LP 254.",
