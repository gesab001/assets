We are not compelled to go away from home, on a long and tedious journey, to save the life of a perishing mortal. At our very doors, all about us, on every side, there are souls to be saved, souls perishing,--men and women dying without hope, without God,--and yet we feel unconcerned, virtually saying by our actions, if not by our words, \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" These men who lost their lives in trying to save others are eulogized by the world as \n                                                                           94\nheroes and martyrs. How should we who have the prospect of eternal life before us feel, if we do not make the little sacrifices that God requires of us, for the salvation of the souls of men?--Review and Herald, Aug. 14, 1888.",
