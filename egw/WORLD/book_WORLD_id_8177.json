    "word": "There is no one who can explain the mystery of the incarnation of Christ. Yet we know that He came to this earth and lived as a man among men. The man Christ Jesus was not the Lord God Almighty, yet Christ and the Father are one. The Deity did not sink under the agonizing torture of Calvary, yet it is nonetheless true that \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
