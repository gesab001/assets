    "word": "Never stir up strife by a domineering spirit. Put away everything like rough dealing, and do seek for a closer walk with God. You used to be more \n\n\n                                    -155- \n\nmeek and humble than you now are. You need the refining grace of God, the meekness of Christ. There is a work allotted you that no one can do for you in \"holding forth the word of life,\" practically setting forth a Christian example. \"Do all things without murmurings and disputings: That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain\" (Philippians 2:14-16).",
