    "word": "In the councils of heaven before the creation of the world, when it was planned that man should people the earth, there arose the question, What if man should sin, as Satan has sinned? Christ answered this question. The infinite Son of God pledged Himself that if man should sin, He would give Himself, His life, as a ransom for the fallen race, taking upon Himself the transgression of humanity. The Innocent would bear the sins of the guilty, and stand before God to make intercession in behalf of the transgressor.",
