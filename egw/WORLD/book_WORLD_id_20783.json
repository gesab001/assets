    "word": "We are to be courteous toward all men, tender hearted and sympathetic; for this was the character Christ manifested when on earth. The more closely we are united with Jesus Christ, the more tender and affectionate will be our conduct toward one another. The redemption of the human race was planned that man, fallen though he was, might be partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. If by his grace we become partakers of the divine nature, our influence upon those around us is not dangerous but beneficial. Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, we can be a blessing to all with whom we associate; for the Holy Spirit's power upon the human heart can make and keep it pure.",
