    "word": "Upon Christian principles, upon a Christian basis, we have pledged ourselves to the service of the Master. It is an honor for us to have any connection with God. Then consider, too, that to us are addressed the words, \"We are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" By the mighty cleaver of truth we have been quarried out of the world. We are now in the workshop of God to be fitted, hewed, and squared. Axe, hammer, and chisel will act their part upon the rough material, and then comes the polishing process. All this hurts the natural temperament, but no other process will give the model the impression of the likeness of Christ.",
