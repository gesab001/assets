    "word": "And if the inhabitants of the world had obeyed the law of God instead of hearing reiterated from the pulpits that God has no law, that God has no commandments; and if the parents should educate their children as Christ enshrouded in the billowy cloud gave the direction to Moses to give to Israel, we should not hear of the thefts, the robberies, the murders, and our jails be filled, the prisons filled with criminals because of the crime and wickedness that prevails in our world to such a fearful extent. Now we would say, Let us love God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.",
