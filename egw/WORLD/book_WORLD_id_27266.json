    "word": "If you live by faith in Christ, your will will be controlled by the will of God; you will have Christ abiding in the soul. Your happiness does not consist in that which you possess, nor in that which you are in yourself, or can be; it consists in the oneness of your will with the will of God. The happiness and glory of the inhabitants of the spiritual world is perfect because the will of God is their will, their supreme delight.",
