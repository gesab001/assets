    "word": "74\n \n     P.S.\u2014 \n     My brethren, we must all work wisely and intelligently. Ceremonies and forms should not become so essential as to mark out a course whereby the Lord should do His work. The world and all society are looked upon as in disorder. Ideas and methods and skilful inventions are instituted to remodel it, but the system is almost altogether human. The change essential is conversion from error to truth. The temple lies in ruins, and an attempt to build it with the same old material is useless. Only the power of God can transform the character of man, conforming him to the image of Christ in heart and mind, for even the thoughts are to be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. Only think of the work to be done. God takes fallen man, a worm of the dust, and transforms him, fitting him to be a member of the heavenly family, a companion through eternal ages, of the angels and of Jesus Christ. He who submits to this process will see God's face, and hold communion with Him.",
