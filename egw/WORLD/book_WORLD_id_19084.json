    "word": "Every true believer catches the beams from the Morning Star and transmits the light to those who sit in darkness. Not only do they shine amid the darkness of their own neighborhood, but as a church they shine forth to regions beyond. The Lord expects every man to do his duty. Every one who unites with the church is to be one with Christ to diffuse the beams of the Morning Star, and becoming the light of the world, Christ and His people are to be copartners in the great work of saving the world.-- Manuscript 51, Nov. 14, 1894.",
