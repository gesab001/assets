Compare \n\n\n                                     -171- \n\nscripture with scripture. Encourage the people to study their Bibles. Nearly all have the common version, and the words are so simple and plain that all who read may understand. Let the Scriptures be read freely in the family and in the pulpit. The men who wrote the books of the Bible were inspired of God, and the words of Holy Writ are for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.",
