Howbeit, as the disciples stood about him, he rose up, and came into the \n\n\n                    (8) \n\ncity; and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. And when he had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch.\" Thus they fulfilled the commission given in Matthew 28:19, 20: \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Their special work was, \"Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must, through much tribulation, enter into the kingdom of God.\" Acts 14:22-28. These experiences were of great value to the churches.",
