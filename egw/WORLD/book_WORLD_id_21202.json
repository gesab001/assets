    "word": "In Nashville I found a little sanitarium, poorly equipped, but patronized by the better class of colored people. This is the only sanitarium we have for the colored people in the South, and \n                                                                           8\nit is sadly in need of assistance. [THIS IS THE ONLY INSTITUTION OF THE KIND IN THE WHOLE WORLD.] Liberal gifts to this enterprise would be pleasing to the Lord. The establishment of this institution on a permanent basis will be but the beginning of a great work that must be done in the cities of the South. We have delayed long enough in the establishment of sanitariums and treatment-rooms in which colored men and women can minister to the physical as well as the spiritual necessities of their fellow-men.",
