    "word": "God has never left his church without a witness. In all the scenes of trial and proving, of opposition and persecution amidst moral darkness, through which the church has passed, God has had men of opportunity who have been prepared to take up his work at different stages, and carry it forward and upward. Through patriarchs and prophets he revealed his truth to his \n\n\n                       - 3 - \n\npeople. Christ was the teacher of his ancient people as verily as he was when he came to the world clothed in the garments of humanity. Hiding his glory in human form, he often appeared to his people, and talked with them \"face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.\" He, their invisible Leader, was enshrouded in the pillar of fire and of cloud, and spoke to his people through Moses. The voice of God was heard by the prophets whom he had appointed to a special work and to bear a special message. He sent them to repeat the same words over and over again. He had a message prepared for them that was not after the ways and will of men, and this he put in their mouths and had them proclaim. He assured them the Holy Spirit would give them language and utterance. He who knew the heart would give them words with which to reach the people.",
