    "word": "THAT THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL UNDER THIS COMMISSION DID NOT END WITH THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH IS EVIDENT FROM THE PROMISE, \"I AM WITH YOU ALWAY, EVEN UNTO THE END OF THE WORLD.\" HE DOES NOT SAY, I AM WITH YOU, APOSTLES, EVERYWHERE, EVEN TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH; BUT I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS, TO THE END OF THE WORLD, OR AGE. IT WILL NOT DO TO SAY THAT THE JEWISH AGE IS MEANT, FOR THAT HAD ALREADY ENDED AT THE CROSS. I CONCLUDE, THEN, THAT THE PREACHING AND THE BELIEF OF THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL WILL ALWAYS BE ATTENDED WITH THE SAME SPIRITUAL AID. THE APOSTLES' COMMISSION BELONGED TO THE CHRISTIAN AGE, AND EMBRACED THE WHOLE OF IT. CONSEQUENTLY THE GIFTS WERE LOST ONLY THROUGH APOSTASY, AND WILL BE REVIVED WITH THE REVIVAL OF PRIMITIVE FAITH AND PRACTICE.",
