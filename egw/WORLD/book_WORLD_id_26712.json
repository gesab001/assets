    "word": "God help us to feel the weight of our responsibility. Take the youth, if you have none of your own, adopt them. I had children of my own, but I did not stop there. I was traveling nearly all over the world, and yet I gathered into my house--\"I have a house,\" I said, \"and children shall come in and enjoy it.\" And I adopted child after child, and I brought some of them up to womanhood and manhood, and God has helped me in the work. When I could gain a victory (when children laid down the stubbornness of their natural tempers) not by beating them, I tried a better plan--to gain their confidence--and then I could do anything with them; and God has helped me in the work. No soul that I have taken in to train and educate has made me regret it. They have given their hearts to Jesus, and we have tried to point them to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.",
