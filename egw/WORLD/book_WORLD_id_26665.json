    "word": "\"Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.\" Now this knowledge does something for us. It is faith in Jesus Christ that is the living, working element. What does it do? \"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.\" Now there are a good many who have this faith tied on the outside, but it needs to be in them, a living, working element in the soul. It needs to be Christ enthroned in the heart. Well, \"every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, \n\n\n                                    -229- \n\neven as he is pure.\" Wonderful, wonderful! By beholding Christ, by talking of Him, by beholding the loveliness of His character, we become changed. Changed from glory to glory. And what is glory? Character--and he becomes changed from character to character. Thus we see that there is a work of purification that goes on by beholding Jesus.",
