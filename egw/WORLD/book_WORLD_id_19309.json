    "word": "No deeper wound could be inflicted on God than to ignore His holy day, and place in its stead a spurious sabbath that bears no mark of sanctity. God gave the Sabbath to the world to be set apart for His name\u2019s glory. He says: \u201cIt is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. . . . Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.\u201d\u2014Signs of the Times, Nov. 22, 1899.",
