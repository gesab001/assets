    "word": "If you, my dear sister, are seen to be firm in principle, fearless in duty, zealous in seeking to exemplify Christ in your daily work, yet humble, lowly, gentle and tender, patient and forgiving, ready to suffer and to forgive injuries, you will be a living epistle known and read of all men. Your friends who are conforming their character to the world are not abiding in Christ, however high may be their profession. They do not discern the value and preciousness of the love of Christ. They cannot have a just sense of the great sacrifice made by the Captain of our salvation to redeem them from hopeless misery.\n233\nThe infinite sacrifice made on their account they cannot discern, therefore they are not willing to make any sacrifice themselves. . . .",
