    "word": "If there are any of you who have weak faith, remember that it is because you do not work on the affirmative side.

Satan is working with intensity of effort, knowing that he has but a short time. Wickedness prevails to an appalling extent. God\u2019s people are but a handful, compared with the ungodly, and we can gain success only as we cooperate with the heavenly angels, who will go before all who press forward to do that which God has said should be done. . . .",
