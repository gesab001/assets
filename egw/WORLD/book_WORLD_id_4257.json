    "word": "Many of the wicked were greatly enraged as they suffered the effects of the plagues. It was a scene of fearful agony. Parents were bitterly reproaching their children, and children their parents, brothers their sisters, and sisters their brothers. Loud, wailing cries were heard in every direction, \"It was you who kept me from receiving the truth which would have saved me from this awful hour.\" The people turned upon their ministers with bitter hate and reproached them, saying, \"You have not warned us. You told us that all the world was to be converted, and cried, Peace, peace, to quiet every fear that was aroused. You have not told us of this hour; and those who warned us of it you declared to be fanatics and evil men, who would ruin us.\" But I saw that the ministers did not escape the wrath of God. Their suffering was tenfold greater than that of their people.",
