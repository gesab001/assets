    "word": "Divine sonship is not something that we gain of ourselves. Only to those who receive Christ as their Saviour is given the power to become sons and daughters of God. The sinner cannot, by any power of his own, rid himself of sin. For the accomplishment of this result, he must look to a higher Power. John exclaimed, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Christ alone has power to cleanse the heart. He who is seeking for forgiveness and acceptance can say only,-- \n     \"Nothing in my hand I bring; \n      Simply to Thy cross I cling.\" But the promise of sonship is made to all who \"believe on his name.\" Every one who comes to Jesus in faith will receive pardon.",
