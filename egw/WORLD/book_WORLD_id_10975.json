    "word": "PRAYER IS THE WEAPON BY WHICH WE RESIST THE ENEMY.\u2014Christ is our only hope. Come to God in the name of Him who gave His life for the life of the world. Rely upon the efficacy of His sacrifice. Show that His love, His joy, is in your soul, and that because of this, your joy is full. In God is our strength. Pray much. Prayer is the life of the soul. The prayer of faith is the weapon by which we may successfully resist every assault of the enemy.\u2014(Signs of the Times, August 24, 1904.)",
