    "word": "These are the signs of the last days. Let everyone who believes in Jesus Christ stop his dark, gloomy utterances and use his talent of voice in exalting Jesus and presenting testimonies that will magnify, honor, and adore the Word of God, illustrate its value, and extol its preciousness. The gospel makes itself known in its power in the consistent, holy, pure lives of those who are believers, hearers, and doers of the Word. The unity and love among believers makes the impression upon the world that the Word of God is true. Purely, boldly, faithfully, and uncompromisingly show the validity and divine character of the Word of God.",
