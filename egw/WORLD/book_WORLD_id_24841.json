    "word": "In His great commission, Christ opened before His disciples the world as their field of labor. They were to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. And they were encouraged with the assurance that many would respond to their message. The promise was given them, \"Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth\" [Acts 1:8]. \"But tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high\" [Luke 24:49].",
