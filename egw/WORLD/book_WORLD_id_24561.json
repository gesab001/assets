    "word": "MR No. 863 - Christian Unity\n\n     God's chosen ones are to reveal to the world their union one with another. It is not possible for a few to walk to heaven alone because they can agree with no others. God's people are a unit. If some entertain ideas so peculiar that God's people cannot accept them, they should compare notes in a teachable spirit and be willing to learn. They should make the most strenuous efforts to be one, to come into the unity of the faith in the bonds of peace. [James 2:12-18 quoted.]",
