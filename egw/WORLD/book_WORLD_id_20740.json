    "word": "The Lord bestows his gifts abundantly upon us. He \"so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Every blessing we have comes through Jesus Christ. Then shall we not arouse, and do our duty toward God, upon whom we are dependent for life and health, for his blessing upon our crops and fields, our cattle, our herds, and our vineyards? We are assured if we give to the Lord's treasury, we shall receive of him again; but if we withhold of our means, he will withhold his blessing from us, and send a curse upon the unfaithful.",
