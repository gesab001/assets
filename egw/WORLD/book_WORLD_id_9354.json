    "word": "Not to Escape Life's Burdens.--Let the youth be impressed with the thought that education is not to teach them how to escape life's disagreeable tasks and heavy burdens; that its purpose is to lighten the work by teaching better methods and higher aims. Teach them that life's true aim is not to secure the greatest possible gain for themselves but to honor their Maker in doing their part of the world's work and lending a helpful hand to those weaker or more ignorant.--Ed 221, 222 (1903).",
