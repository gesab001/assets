The champions of truth will have a fierce conflict. \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\" The warning comes and the directions are repeated. \"Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand.\" All that the Lord has told you it devolves on you to do.

I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.\"",
