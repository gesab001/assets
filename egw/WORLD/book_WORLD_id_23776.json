    "word": "It was at the last Passover that the disciples were to hold with their Lord that these words were spoken. Very soon Christ was to offer Himself as a sacrifice for the world. At this time, in the last hours that the disciples would have with their Master, Satan made a determined effort to arouse contention among them. Sorrow filled Christ's heart as He saw them yielding to the spirit of strife, and disputing as to who should be greatest. Had they been in a right frame of mind, they would have received great blessing. But they came to the supper with hearts filled with selfishness, and with tempers heated by contention.",
