    "word": "The world is no more ready to credit the message for this time than were the Jews to receive the Saviour's warning concerning Jerusalem. Come when it may, the day of God will come unawares to the ungodly. When life is going on in its unvarying round; when men are absorbed in pleasure, in business, in traffic, in money-making; when religious leaders are magnifying the world's progress and enlightenment, and the people are lulled in a false security,\u2014then, as the midnight thief steals within the unguarded dwelling, so shall sudden destruction come upon the careless and ungodly, \u201cand they shall not escape.\u201d [1 Thessalonians 5:2-5.]",
