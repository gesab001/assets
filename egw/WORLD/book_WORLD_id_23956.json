    "word": "In this period of the world's history, God's servants are to have confidence in His ability to qualify men to do His work in various ways, to the glory of His name. Those appointed to lead out in the management of His cause in the earth, are to have faith that He is able to perfect a work in righteousness even through the instrumentality of imperfect workmen. Those in charge of the work are now to seek to build up, to encourage, to strengthen, but not to discourage, or to pull to pieces that which has been begun. . . .",
