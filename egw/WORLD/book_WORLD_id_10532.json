    "word": "There is no limit to the influence of the human agent who wears the yoke with Christ. Daily he studies the life of Christ and conforms his life to the divine pattern.... It is by the manifestation of the spirit of Christ in our words and actions that the world takes knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus, that we are the children of God. The true nature of our religion is ... in the gentle spirit, the kindness, the peace which we manifest.",
