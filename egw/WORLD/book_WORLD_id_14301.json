    "word": "The world is no more ready now to credit the warning than were the Jews in the days of our Saviour. Come when it may, the end will come unawares to the ungodly. When life is going on in its unvarying round; when men are absorbed in pleasure, in business, in traffic, in money-making; when religious leaders are magnifying the world's progress and enlightenment, and the people are lulled in a false security,--then, as the midnight thief steals within the unguarded dwelling, so shall sudden destruction come upon the careless and ungodly, \"and they shall not escape.\"",
