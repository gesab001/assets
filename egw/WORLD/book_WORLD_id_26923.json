    "word": "In the place of going to your rooms, as was done when I was here ten years ago, and talking of difficulties, talking the Holy Spirit away, talk with God, and He will be with you. Hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. I know that God wants you to have something to say to the churches, and what you say is to be like apples of gold in pictures of silver. No cheap words are to be uttered. We have a heaven of treasure, for when God gave Christ to our world, He gave us all heaven. And if you do not draw from heaven power and grace and treasures of truth to give to the people, then, for Christ's sake, stop your work till you realize the importance of a close union with God.",
