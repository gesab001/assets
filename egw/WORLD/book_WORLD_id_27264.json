    "word": "I entreat you to make diligent work for eternity. We have but little time in this life. We want to be led by the Spirit of Christ. (at all times) We should never stir up strife by domineering words and actions. Put away everything like hard dealing, and seek for a closer walk with God. You used to be a more meek and humble man than you are now. You need the refining grace of God, the meekness of Christ. There is a work allotted to you that no one can do for you. \"Holding forth the word of life\" you are to practically set forth a Christian example. \"Do all things without murmuring or disputing, that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke in the midst of a crooked, perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.\"",
