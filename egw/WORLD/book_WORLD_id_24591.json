    "word": "The close confinement of students to mental work has cost the life of many precious youth. The Madison school, in its system of education, is \n\n\n                                   -183- \n\nshowing that mental and physical powers, brain and muscle, must be equally taxed.

If the physical and mental powers were equally taxed, there would be in our world far less of corruption of mind and far less feebleness of health.--Letter 168, 1908, pp. 3, 4. (To J. E. White and wife, May 26, 1908.)",
