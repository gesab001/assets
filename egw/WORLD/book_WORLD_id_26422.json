    "word": "Christ's work did not bring Him any worldly glory. Through the prophet Isaiah He declares, \"I am sought of them that asked not for Me; I am found of them that sought Me not: I said, Behold Me, behold Me, unto a nation that was not called by My name. I have spread out my \n\n\n                                     -404- \n\nhands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts; a people that provoketh Me to anger continually to My face.\" Today the Lord Jesus employs every channel through which He can work. But many, by their self-exaltation and self-sufficiency, make it apparent that they are not controlled by the Holy Spirit. Instead, they magnify self into such large proportions that God is not revealed, God is not honored.",
