    "word": "Christ's first advent to our world is not studied as it should be. He came to be our example in all things. His life was one of strict self-- denial, and never are we to expend means unnecessarily. Never are we to seek for outward show. Let our showing be such that the light of truth can shine forth from our good works, so that God will be glorified by the good deeds done to restore the sick and relieve physical disorders by correct methods.",
