    "word": "Labor in perseverance, in tenderness, compassion, prayerfulness, and love will do more than sermons. The Lord Jesus, in giving His life for the saving of the world from the curse of sin, intended greater things than our eyes have yet witnessed. The Holy Spirit is waiting for channels through whom to work. . . . Satan will not always triumph. The Spirit of God will be poured out upon the church just as soon as the  vessels are prepared to receive it.",
