    "word": "I tell you in the fear of God, stand in God to do His will, to keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment. Let there be no betrayal of sacred trusts on your part. . . . Walk humbly and softly before God. If God sees the least injustice done to one of His children, He will punish for these things. . . . The Lord God is ruler of the world, ruler of His own subjects.",
