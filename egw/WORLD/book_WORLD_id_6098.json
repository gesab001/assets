    "word": "If the Lord favors the work in some countries above that in other countries, it is that there may be revealed a spirit of true liberality, a desire to assist those who greatly need help in order to find a standing-place, and to give character to the work. The Lord is no respecter of persons or of places. His work is one great whole. His truth is to be proclaimed to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; and as new fields are entered and people accept the truth, houses of worship and schoolhouses are to be erected, and other needed facilities supplied. Printing-presses are to be set in operation in many parts of the world.",
