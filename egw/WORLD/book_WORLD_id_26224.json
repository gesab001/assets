    "word": "We have had many years of experience in the cause and work of God, and have seen many persons who have moved in blindness, resisting the work of the Spirit of God, and we have seen the result, which has been a separation from God and eventually from the truth. The natural heart despises reproof, and there are those who, when corrected by the Spirit of God, rise up against it. They appeal to their own sympathy, and relate matters to others in their own way, putting a wrong light upon everything, and obtain their sympathies, and friends and relatives unite with them to make of none effect the work of God to correct, reprove, and rebuke the erring. They lean to their own understanding; they refuse counsel, and in the place of harmonizing with the Spirit of God to set things in order, they work in an opposite direction. They erect standards of their own, by which they measure character. Jesus said, \"I am the light of the world: he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\"",
