    "word": "Why then is the world not filled with the glory of God? Why do you not find human beings that are making it their aim and object to know God and to know Jesus Christ whom He hath sent? Why do you not see the instruction coming from parents to children? Why has it not been in past generations that the instruction has come from parents to children, and thus children have been trained and disciplined and educated so that the first lessons they shall teach their children will be lessons of God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent? They must know this or they will never know what eternal life is.",
