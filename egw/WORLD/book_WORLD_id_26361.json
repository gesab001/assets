    "word": "Jesus connected His disciples with Himself in His ministry that they might be educated to carry forward the work where He should leave it. They were not only to be conversant with the Scriptures but to do the works that He had done, in His name. They were to witness His life of daily self-denial and self-sacrifice, His life of prayer and of doing good that He might be the Light of the world. His followers are to pursue the very same course. Close connection with Jesus Christ alone will give our ministers a fitness for the great work which must be done in warning the world and in winning souls from deceptive errors to the truth which involves a cross.",
