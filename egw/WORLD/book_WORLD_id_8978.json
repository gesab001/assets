    "word": "A United Work \n\n     Our work is to gain a knowledge of Him who is the way, the truth, and the life. We are to interest people in the subjects that concern the health of the body, as well as in the subjects that concern the health of the soul. Believers have a decided message to bear to prepare the way for the kingdom of God. The will of the Lord is to be done on earth. We have not one moment to spend in idle speculation. \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight,\" is the message that we are to proclaim. Amidst all the confusion that now fills the world, a clear, decided message is to be heard.",
