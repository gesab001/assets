    "word": "What do we read in the seventeenth chapter of John? \"I have given \n\n                                  -124- \n\nunto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely (by experimental knowledge) that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.\" Please read this chapter; for it is full of richness. \"As thou hast sent me into the world,\" Christ continued, \"even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.\" Are we voicing the words of Christ? Are we sanctifying ourselves through obedience to the truth?",
