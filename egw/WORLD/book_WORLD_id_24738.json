    "word": "To be good and to do good--this is our part. The heart must be right with God. The affections must be devoted to Him. To the world, to angels, \n\n\n                                    -215- \n\nand to men we are to show the blessed results of being in God's service, of conforming to His will, and bearing His sign, shown by observance of the seventh-day Sabbath. The reverence that we show to this day is the sign that we accept Jehovah as our God.",
