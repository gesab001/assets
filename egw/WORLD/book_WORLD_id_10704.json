    "word": "World Church\n \n\n     Support offerings for imperiled institutions.--When the Lord places before us an appeal to be responded to, just at the time when offerings are to be made by our people, let the ministers and church officers take up the matter earnestly and vigorously. Let them as stewards of God decide what is to be done, and then do it. This is absolutely necessary when our institutions are in so great peril.--RH March 19, 1901.",
