    "word": "There is work for every one to do who has named the name of Christ. Will he do it? If we would be duly impressed with the value of souls we must oft look to Calvary and see the dying Son of the infinite God giving up His life for a lost world. We must look, and contemplate how He estimated man. We must be imbued with His spirit. The sight of our eyes, the contemplation of the mind will certainly affect the soul, and set in operation practical effort to save the perishing. Thus the missionary work will be placed upon its proper basis.",
