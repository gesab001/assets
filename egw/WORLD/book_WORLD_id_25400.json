    "word": "Giving to advance the truth, because it is the truth as it is in Jesus, increases our love for the truth. To give to the Lord's cause that which He has entrusted to us to bestow wisely at times when the cause and work of God needs help, provides a fund from which to draw to sustain the work in its different branches, and this giving will be a personal benefit in uplifting and strengthening the one who invests. When one shows his special interest in this way, that action will react upon himself in this world, and the deed lives in the record of heaven to bring its reward in the future eternal world.",
