    "word": "The right discipline is not given to our churches by encouraging them to expect to be constantly fed with sermons from the ministers who ought to be giving the truth to those who know it not. The members of these churches ought to be taught to reflect the light of truth to all with whom they come in contact. A working church is ever delivering by precept and example an effective testimony to the world. By their burden for souls, by the prayers they offer in sincerity for their fellow creatures, the members are stretching out their hands all the day long. Theories and arguments do not interest them. They strive to bring the truth close to hearts. They hunt for souls. But let a church be given food constantly, while the members do not do righteousness in their own homes or in the church, and it is a curse instead of a blessing.",
