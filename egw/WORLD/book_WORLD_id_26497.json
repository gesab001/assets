    "word": "Harvest Proportional to Agencies Used \n     We see the need of more devoted laborers. The prayer should go forth from unfeigned lips, for the God of the harvest to raise up laborers, for an increase of Christian instrumentality. The harvest of the world is to be reaped through the heavenly instrumentality cooperating with human agencies. In proportion as the agency is increased under the superintendency of holy messengers from heaven, will be the extent of the harvest reaped.--Letter 3, 1891",
