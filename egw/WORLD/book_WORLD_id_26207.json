    "word": "A banquet has been prepared for us. The Lord has spread before us the treasures of His Word. But we must not come to the repast clothed in citizen's dress. We must have on the white robe of Christ's righteousness which has been prepared for all the guests. But the spirit of the world is carnal. \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned\" (1 Corinthians 2:14). The more spiritual knowledge one has, the better able is he to distinguish between good and evil.",
