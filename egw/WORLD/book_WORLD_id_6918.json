    "word": "GOD IS VINDICATED BEFORE THE UNIVERSE.\u2014Every question of truth and error in the long-standing controversy has now been made plain. The results of rebellion, the fruits of setting aside the divine statutes, have been laid open to the view of all created intelligences. The working out of Satan\u2019s rule in contrast with the government of God has been presented to the whole universe. Satan\u2019s own works have condemned him. God\u2019s wisdom, His justice, and His goodness stand fully vindicated. It is seen that all His dealings in the great controversy have been conducted with respect to the eternal good of His people and the good of all the worlds that He has created. \u201cAll Thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord; and Thy saints shall bless Thee.\u201d Psalm 145:10.",
