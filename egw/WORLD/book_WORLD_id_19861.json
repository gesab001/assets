    "word": "Who can fathom the suffering of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, as He felt to its fullest extent the weight of the sin of the world? So keenly did He feel the sinfulness of sin that for a moment the cup trembled in His hand, and all heaven heard the agonizing cry, \"O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me\" (Matthew 26:39). \"Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done\" (Luke 22:42).
