    "word": "The Lord would have us look to Him and cry for His Holy Spirit, for there are souls to save. We need not only work out our own salvation, but it is our duty to assist others to become acquainted with God. This should be done with fear and trembling. We should accept the word of God and have His love in our hearts. Christ says, \"If ye love Me, keep My commandments\" [John 14:15]. If we have the love of God in our hearts we shall be happy. We may be poor in this world, but we are joint heirs with Jesus Christ. \n\n\n                                    -266-",
