    "word": "In one of the glorious visions given John the beloved on the isle of Patmos, the prophet's attention was arrested by \"a voice from heaven\" bidding him write: \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.\" Revelation 14:13. Wonderful words these, and especially when considered in the light of their setting at the close of the prophecy concerning a threefold message to be sounded preparatory to the end of the world and the second advent of Christ.",
