    "word": "\"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers\" [2 Timothy 2:14]. There are to be no schisms in the church of Christ. God designs that a people shall stand forth before the world sound in principle, and He would have all heed the words, \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.... But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. And the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will\" [Verses 15, 23-26].",
