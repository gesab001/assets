    "word": "The Captain of our salvation made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, in order that humanity might be allied to divinity. Man is to represent Christ. He is to be long-suffering toward his fellow men, to be patient, forgiving, and full of Christlike love. He who is truly converted will manifest respect for his brethren; he will do as Christ has commanded. Jesus said, \"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another\" (John 13:34, 35). Where the love of Christ abounds in the soul, there will be an expression of that love that will be understood by the world. . . .",
