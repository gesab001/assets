    "word": "The temple was supported by seven pillars, all of transparent gold, set with pearls most glorious. The things I saw there I cannot describe. Oh that I could talk in the language of Canaan, then could I tell a little of the glory of the better world. I saw there tables of stone in which the names of 144,000 were engraved in letters of gold. After we beheld the glory of the temple, we went out, and Jesus left us, and went to the City. Soon we heard His lovely voice again, saying, \u201cCome, My people, you have come out of great tribulation, and done My will; suffered for Me; come in to supper; for I will gird Myself and serve you.\u201d We shouted Alleluia, glory, and entered into the City.",
