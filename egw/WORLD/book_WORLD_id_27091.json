    "word": "This institution has been the means of elevating the truth, and bringing it before thousands. The religious influence which pervades the institution inspires the patients with confidence. The assurance they have that the Lord presides over the Sanitarium, the many prayers offered for the sick, does much to soothe their nerves. Many men and women who have never before thought of the value of their souls are convinced by the Spirit of God that they have made a mistake. They have put worldly position, human wisdom and wealth in the place of God and heaven. Careless, irreligious souls, full of pride and self-love, stand as it were before the bar of God, to consider their past and future; and not a few change the whole course of their life. Man has inherited an intense desire to save himself, and thus show his independence. Impressions that will never be effaced have been made upon self-righteous souls, who have thought their own standard of character sufficient, who have felt no need of Christ's righteousness. When the test comes, when enlightenment comes to them, they will take their stand for truth.",
