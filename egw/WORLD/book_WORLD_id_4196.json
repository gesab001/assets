    "word": "Many of these professed Christians dress, talk, and act like the world, and the only thing by which they may be known is their profession. Though they profess to be looking for Christ, their conversation is not in heaven, but on worldly things. \"What manner of persons\" ought those to be \"in all holy conversation and godliness,\" who profess to be \"looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God.\" 2 Peter 3:11, 12. \"Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\" 1 John 3:3. But it is evident that many who bear the name of Adventist study more to decorate their bodies and to appear well in the eyes of the world than they do to learn from the Word of God how they may be approved of Him.",
