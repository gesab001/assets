    "word": "Money is a needed treasure; let it not be lavished upon those who do not need it. Some one needs your willing gifts. Those who have had means to use freely have not taken into consideration the fact that there are multitudes in the world who are hungry, starving. They may say, I can not feed them all. But by practicing the lessons of Christ on economy, you can feed one. It may be that you can feed many who are hungering for temporal food. And you can feed their souls with the bread of life. \"Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost.\" These words were spoken by Him whose power wrought a miracle to supply the needs of five thousand men besides women and children.",
