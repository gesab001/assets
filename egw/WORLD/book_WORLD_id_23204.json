    "word": "That which Christ has taught and done, His representatives are to teach and do in their mission of saving the souls of men. Cold austerity is to be melted away, harshness and evil speaking is to be purged from the character. The influence of Christ is to be cherished and diffused to those who are about us, by a well-ordered life and a godly conversation. The people of God are to shine as lights amid the moral darkness of the world. The time in which we live calls for vital, sanctified energy, for earnestness, zeal, tenderest sympathy, and love. The time calls for the speaking of words that will not create misery, not come from mere profession of righteousness, from a dead form, but from a living piety. Half a dozen persons whose light is clear and shining will be of far more value in Hobart than a thousand who have no vital piety. \n\n\n                                     -278-",
