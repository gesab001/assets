    "word": "There were times when Christ spoke with the authority of true greatness. \"He that hath ears to hear,\" He said, \"let him hear.\" He called for submissive attention to His words, for although He was in human form, He bore His commission from the Excellent Glory. \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, . . . full of grace and truth.\" God summons the world to listen while He speaks, and to receive every word He utters as law and life.",
