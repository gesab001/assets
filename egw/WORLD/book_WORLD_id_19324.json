    "word": "Now Jesus rested from the work of redemption; and though there was grief among those who loved Him on earth, yet there was joy in heaven. Glorious to the eyes of heavenly beings was the promise of the future. . . .With this scene the day upon which Jesus rested is forever linked. For \u201chis work is perfect\u201d (Deuteronomy 32:4); and \u201cwhatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever\u201d (Ecclesiastes 3:14). When there shall be a \u201crestitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began\u201d (Acts 3:21), the creation Sabbath, the day on which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph\u2019s tomb, will still be a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven and earth will unite in praise, as \u201cfrom one sabbath to another\u201d (Isaiah 66:23) the nations of the saved shall bow in joyful worship to God and the Lamb.",
