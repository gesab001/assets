    "word": "Why did the inhabitants of the Noatic world know not the day of their visitation? Because they did not have warnings? No, but because they did not heed the message God sent them through Noah (Genesis 6:5-7, 11-13). God gave directions to Noah to build an ark on dry land, and to warn the people. Noah gave the message of the Lord to the large population upon the earth--he gave it by voice and then showed his faith by his works, in building the ark. God gave him exact directions for building this ark.",
