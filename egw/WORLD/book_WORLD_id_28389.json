    "word": "I felt a heavy burden this morning when I read over a letter that I found in my room, in which a plan was outlined for having medical students take some work at Loma Linda, but to get the finishing touches of their education from some worldly institution. I must state that the light that I have received is that we are to stand as a commandment-keeping people, and this will separate us from the world. The Sabbath is a great distinguishing line. As God's peculiar people we should not feel that we must acknowledge our dependence upon the transgressors of God's law to give us influence. He will give us advantages that are far above all the advantages we can receive from worldlings.",
