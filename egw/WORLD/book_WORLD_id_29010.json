    "word": "The Redeemer of the world was of humble parentage. He, the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, humbled Himself to accept humanity, and then He chose a life of poverty and toil. \u201cFor your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.\u201d When one came saying, \u201cI will follow thee whithersoever thou goest,\u201d Jesus answered him, \u201cThe foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\u201d He, the Majesty of heaven, depended upon the generosity of His followers.",
