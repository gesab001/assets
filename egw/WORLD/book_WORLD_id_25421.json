    "word": "Keep Jesus constantly in view, telling of One mightier than yourself. God would have His own people true to principle, servants of a great Creator, doing their work as shepherds of the flock of God, ever presenting the greater Shepherd, that the eyes of their hearers may be attracted to the fountain of light, and that Christ our Lord shall be exalted in word, in manner, in spirit, in calm self-possession. Let the watchword be, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\"",
