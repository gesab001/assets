    "word": "I question whether genuine rebellion is ever curable. Study in Patriarchs and Prophets the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. This rebellion was extended, including more than two men. [A COMPARISON IS HERE DRAWN BETWEEN KORAH'S REBELLION AND A CURRENT APOSTASY LED BY TWO MEN IN A CERTAIN FIELD. SEE ALSO PAGE 394.] It was led by two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, men of renown. Call rebellion by its right name and apostasy by its right name, and then consider that the experience of the ancient people of God with all its objectionable features was faithfully chronicled to pass into history. The Scripture declares, \"These things . . . are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come\" (1 Corinthians 10:11). And if men and women who have the knowledge of the truth are so far separated from their great Leader that they will take the great leader of apostasy and name him Christ our Righteousness, it is because they have not sunk deep into the mines of the truth. They are not able to distinguish the precious ore from the base material.",
