    "word": "Multitudes of varied faith will arise in these last days and will be crying, \"Lo here!\" \"Lo, there!\" Such have found some way for the sinner rather than the Bible way, which teaches that repentance toward God for the transgression of His law and faith in Jesus Christ the world's Redeemer, is the only door through which the sinner may enter. Let the mind and heart be imbued with the principles of God's law. Then they will yield obedience to its sacred claims and gamblers will decrease and the wine cup be abandoned.",
