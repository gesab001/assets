    "word": "God has entrusted to His ministers the work of proclaiming His last message of mercy to the world. He is displeased with those who do not throw their whole energies into this all-important work. Unfaithfulness on the part of the appointed watchmen on the walls of Zion endangers the cause of truth, and exposes it to the ridicule of the enemy. It is time for our ministers to understand the responsibility and sacredness of their mission. 7T 245.",
