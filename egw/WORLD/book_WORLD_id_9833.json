    "word": "Of every Christian the Lord requires growth in efficiency and capability in every line. Christ has paid us our wages, even His own blood and suffering, to secure our willing service. He came to our world to give us an example of how we should work and what spirit we should bring into our labor. He desires us to show how we can best advance His work and glorify His name in the world, crowning with honor, with the greatest love and devotion, the Father who \"so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" \n                                                                           219",
