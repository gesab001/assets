    "word": "I have tried to write to you before, but have been too weary after speaking. Be assured that I received you letter with thanksgiving. I know that the Spirit of the Lord has been grieved and His name dishonored. But if you will carry out the work of repentance that you have begun, I will do my best to help in every way possible. The Lord would be greatly dishonored were His people to follow a course that would lead the people of the world to think that we were divided into two parties. To keep up an internal warfare would please the enemy and greatly retard the work that the Lord would have done in our world.",
