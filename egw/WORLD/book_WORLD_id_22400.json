    "word": "Brethren, the days of our probation are nearly ended. It is time to awake out of sleep. You are in a position of great responsibility. You need to watch unto prayer. Watch against habits of sin. Keep a watch over the tongue. Watch for opportunities to do good and bless others, ever looking to Jesus, growing in grace and a knowledge of the truth. If you want the higher life, you must live the higher life in the lower life of this world. We are working for time and for eternity. A well-built life is formed by living upon the plan of addition, laying up one grace after another, in good works, in faith, patience, temperance, benevolence, courage, self-denial. \"Ye are God's husbandry. Ye are God's building.\" Learning of Christ you will not be a jumble of opposites and inconsistencies, today sober and devout, tomorrow careless and frivolous.",
