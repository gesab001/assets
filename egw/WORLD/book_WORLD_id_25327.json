    "word": "The Lord is good, merciful, and forbearing. The works of creation reveal His character. \"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handywork.\" It is man, formed in the image of God, who does not magnify the Lord of Hosts in contemplating the love of God and the perfection of His law. We may now see that the transgression of the law of God has been bringing upon the world God's displeasure. If he will, man may read in the natural world nature's testimony to the result of man's transgression of the law of Jehovah.",
