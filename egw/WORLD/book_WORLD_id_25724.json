    "word": "My brethren in the ministry, you ought to be reaching higher and still higher in Christian experience--higher not by self-assertion, self- assumption, and self-confidence, but by growth in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Press forward toward the mark of the prize of your high calling in Christ Jesus. How much we need to be faithful watchmen over self, to make sure that we have not the spirit which leads us to hurt and destroy in the place of using our God-given talents in awakening the inhabitants of our world to a realization of their lost and undone condition. Let us not be content to be as men who have left their first love.--Ms 166, 1902. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Dec. 17, 1987. Entire Ms.",
