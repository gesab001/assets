    "word": "A sense of duty to my Lord leads me to speak. The time for action has come. I have had much to say of the glory of God as seen in His created works, but never have I left the impression that our God Omnipotent, who ruleth in the heavens and fills all the heavens, is to be found in flower, and leaf, and tree. What I have said of God's works in nature, was meant to lead the mind from nature to nature's God, to show that all the glory should be given to Him who ruleth in the heavens, controlling all things in heaven and in earth. Men are to discharge their duty to God. They are to have reverence for, and a knowledge of, a personal God. They are to praise and glorify His name as the One who has placed many beautiful things in this sin-corrupted earth, that from the child to the man and woman of mature years, all may see that God loves His family here below. He so loves us, that He gave us a tangible proof of His love, by sending His only begotten Son to bear the sin of the world, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. God desires us to think of the height and depth and breadth of His measureless love, which is without a parallel, and to remember that we are His purchased possession. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" We are to act as in the sight of the heavenly universe, conscientiously discharging our obligations to our Creator.",
