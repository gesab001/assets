    "word": "Christ tells us not to depend for help upon those who themselves bear the defects of humanity, but to \n\n\n                                     -271- \n\ncome to Him. He promises to give us rest. The condition upon which rest may be obtained is obedience to the words, \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me.\" This, my brother, is the experience you need. If you do not comply with the conditions Christ has laid down, you will never know the joy of rest in Christ. You are now fretting over that which you can no more bring about than you can make a world. Because you suppose that you must be conscience for your brethren, you are taking upon yourself burdens which will crush you.",
