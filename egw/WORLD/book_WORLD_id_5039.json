    "word": "Very much may be done for those who are deprived of the softening, subduing influences of the home circle. The spirit manifested by many shows that the language of the heart is, \"'Am I my brother's keeper?' I have no burden or responsibility aside from my own family. I have no special burden or interest for the students who occupy rooms in my house.\" I would ask these persons if they have burdens and feel responsibilities for their own children. I am sorry to see so little anxiety on the part of some parents that all the influences surrounding their children should be favorable to the formation of Christian character; but those who do have soul-burdens for their own loved ones should not selfishly confine their interest to their own family. Jesus is our example in all things; but He has given us no example of such selfishness as we see manifested by many who profess to be His followers. \n                                                                           51\nIf we abide in Christ, and His love abides in us, we shall love those for whom Christ died; for He has commanded His followers to love one another as He has loved them. Do we who profess His name obey this injunction? If we fail in this point we shall in others also. Had Christ studied His own profit, convenience, and pleasure, the world would have been left to perish in its sin and corruption.",
