    "word": "God's people are to reveal the attributes of Christ,--the tenderness, the compassion, the unselfish generosity that He always manifested toward the poor, the distressed, and the needy. \"Whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?\" Let there be no shutting up of the bowels of compassion; for those who do this are deprived of the Spirit of God.",
