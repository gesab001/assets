    "word": "When the temptation was presented to Christ that the whole world should be given to Him if He should fall down and worship Satan, divinity flashed through humanity, and with a voice that Satan understood perfectly, He said, \"get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.\" Thus Christ resisted every temptation.",
