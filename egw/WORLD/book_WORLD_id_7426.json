    "word": "Do you realize your value in the sight of God? He says, Ye are laborers together with Me. Are you letting your light shine in clear rays to a fallen world?

You may not be an eloquent speaker, but you can be eloquent in living Christ, you can be eloquent in letting your light shine before men.",
