    "word": "The words that we are commanded to teach are the very words that Christ spoke while on this earth. We can dispense with human sophistry. Those who teach it will not have the heavenly endorsement, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" I call upon you, my brother, to be a free man. The time you have spent in the Sanitarium has not given you the qualifications that would fit you to be a co-worker with the great Medical Missionary in saving souls. Had you placed yourself under the instruction \n\n\n                                  -263- \n\nof the greatest Teacher the world has ever known, He would have given you an education that would have prepared you to work with Him. You would not have obtained an experience that would have almost unfitted you to be Christ's co-laborer in the healing of the souls and bodies of His people.",
