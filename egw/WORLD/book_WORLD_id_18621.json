    "word": "John was constantly learning to copy the life of Jesus. He was learning in Christ's school. . . . Lesson after lesson Christ gave to His disciples, that they might know the will of the Father and shine as lights in the world. John and Peter were men whom God could trust, but Judas was not. They had received and heeded the lessons and gained the victory, but Judas had failed at every trial. He saw his faults, but instead of correcting them revenged himself by picking flaws in others around him. . . . Paul says to Timothy, \"Take heed unto thyself\"; that is, seek God first for thyself. Let us individually turn our attention to ourselves, diligently guard our own souls, and set a Christlike example before those whom we would criticise.",
