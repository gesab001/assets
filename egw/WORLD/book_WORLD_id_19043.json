    "word": "The whole of the natural world bears testimony of the works of the living God. Nature is our lesson book, given to us by God, the Creator of all things. These things of nature are not to be called God. They are the expression of God's character, but they are not God. By the things of His creation, we may understand God, and His love, His power, and His glory, but there is a great danger of men worshiping nature as God.",
