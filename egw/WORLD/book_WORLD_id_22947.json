    "word": "What a Covenant Is This! \n\n\n     On one occasion, turning to His disciples, who were to suffer for His sake, He pledged His word to them, saying, \"In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world\" (John 16:33). He has declared Himself the Helper of all who join His army, to cooperate with Him in fighting His battles against visible and invisible foes. He has promised that they shall be heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, that they will reign as kings and priests with God. What a covenant is this! Those who accept Christ, those who are willing to share His humiliation before the world shall become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. Those who choose to suffer affliction with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, shall be partakers with Christ in His glory. He will give them the dignity of His name. Letter 79, 1900, p. 7. (To Mr. William Kerr, May 10, 1900.)",
