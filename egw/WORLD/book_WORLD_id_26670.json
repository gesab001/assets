    "word": "The righteousness of God never covers a soul all polluted with sin. John says, \"Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). Will you let Him take it away? You cannot bear your own sin. Christ says He will take your sin if you lay hold of the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour. Christ came and suffered for our sins \"that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). Believe on Him as One upon whom the sins of the whole world are laid that man might have another trial. That trial we are having today. Shall it be that Christ shall not have died for us in vain? Shall we give to the world the evidence of the character of God because of our rectitude in keeping His commandments? May God help us to be loyal servants of His.",
