    "word": "Represent Upright Principles \n\n     Honesty, integrity, justice, mercy, love, compassion, and sympathy are embraced in medical missionary work. In all this work the religion of the Bible is to be practiced. The Lord does not want anyone to labor as His representative who follows the wrong customs and practices of worldly physicians in treating suffering humanity. Our physicians need to reform in the matter of making high charges for critical operations. And the reform should extend farther than this. Often an exorbitant sum is charged for even small services, because physicians are supposed to be governed in their charges by the practices of worldly physicians. Some follow worldly policy in order to accumulate means, as they say, for God's service. But God does not accept such offerings. He says, \"I hate robbery for burnt offering.\" Isaiah 61:8. Those who deal unjustly with their fellowmen while professing to believe My word, I will judge for thus misrepresenting Me.",
