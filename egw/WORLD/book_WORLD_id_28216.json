    "word": "Do not gather together those to whom God has given this commission, and make them believe that they have to spend years in college in order to obtain a training for the Lord's work. Christ's presence is of more value than years of training. Let our young people come under the yoke of Christ, and by faith go forth as gospel medical missionaries, taking with them the promise, \"Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.\" Let them go forth two and two, depending on God, not on man, for their wisdom and their success. Let them search the Scriptures, and then present the truths of God's word to others. Let them be guided by the principles that God has laid down.",
