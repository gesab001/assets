    "word": "God wants an entirely different order of things. He wants these men who think it is their duty to block the wheels, to put their shoulder to the chariot of truth, and roll it up the steep ascent. They should remember that Christ says of his disciples, \"All ye are brethren.\" Those who have despised the men who have borne the message of God, have despised not the men, but the Lord who has given them their message and their work. All this God will require at their hands. The Lord's work needed every jot and tittle of experience that he had given Eld. Butler and Eld. Smith; but they have taken their own course in some things irrespective of the light God has given. Had Eld. Littlejohn walked in the light, he could \n                                                                           1249\nhave been a great blessing in many ways; but selfishness has in a large degree closed about his soul, and he has been watching and criticizing the course of the men to whom God has given the message of truth to give to the world at this time. The Lord in his providence has permitted these brethren who have been doing his work to make some mistakes. For what reason?--To reveal what is in the hearts of men who have also made mistakes, and whom God has repeatedly graciously pardoned. God is testing and proving them to see what manner of spirit they are of. He endorses not their work of holding themselves aloof from light and the Holy Spirit of God. They will not receive a reward for their opposition in spirit to the work of God.",
