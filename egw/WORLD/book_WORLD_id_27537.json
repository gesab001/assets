    "word": "This has been the case from the first discovery of the present truth for this age. We are to call on the Lord to open the way, to sacrifice ourselves, and then pray the Lord for help.

God has wrought through human instrumentalities in proclaiming the messages of truth He has given them to bear. From a very small beginning in their missionary work, great results have been accomplished. This work lies in a sphere so heavenly that the devices of human ambition have never reached it. It requires so large a scope that the worldly-wise policies of worldly statesmen would add nothing to its success, but be spent and lost.",
