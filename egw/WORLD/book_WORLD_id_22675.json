    "word": "My brethren and sisters at the Sanitarium, Bro. McCoy and Sr. Lamson in particular, you may depend upon what I say,--the secret of life's success is in a careful, conscientious attention to the little things. God makes the simple leaf, the tiny flower, the blade of grass, with as much care as he creates a world. The symmetrical structure of a strong, beautiful character is built up by individual acts of duty. You must learn to be faithful in the least as well as in the greatest duty. Your work cannot bear the inspection of God, unless it be found to include a faithful, diligent, economical care for the little things. At every point, losses are occurring which it is your duty to prevent.",
