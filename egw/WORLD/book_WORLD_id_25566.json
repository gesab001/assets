    "word": "I have a message for the presidents of our schools. Have you exalted the law of Christ's kingdom by giving to it willing obedience? If you are not of yourselves under the control of the Ruler of the universe, how can you obey His law, as required in His Word? We know that it is the determined purpose of some to be obedient to every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Such men and women will be given power of intellect to see the difference between righteousness and unrighteousness. They have the faith that works by love and purifies the soul, and they reveal God to the world.",
