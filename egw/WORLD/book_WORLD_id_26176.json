    "word": "At Ogden we have additional passengers. A tall, dignified gentleman enters, accompanied by his wife and little daughter. His own hair is as black as the raven's wing, but his wife's is as white as snow and hangs in ringlets, giving her a singular appearance. This man is the great temperance worker, Mr. McKenzie. He has established an institution in the east to treat inebriates and is now visiting Colorado for the same purpose, having already obtained pledges to the amount of several thousand dollars. Seeing us all writing, he had some curiosity to know who we were and what we were doing, and so introduced himself to us. While seated by our side, he composed some verses upon that evening's sunset, which we will here copy. This celebrated temperance lecturer, we doubt not, has accomplished a great amount of good in the world, but he is an inveterate tobacco user, and we venture the assertion that if he would reform on this point his usefulness would be greatly increased.",
