    "word": "It is not human wisdom that will reveal the fulness of the perfection of Christ to our world. It is perfect obedience to the commands of God--the doing of the work that God has planned for us to do. This will give us purity of sentiment, and will show that we are born of God. A pure wisdom can be developed only by men and women who have an acute sense of propriety in every action, and a true ideal of moral power, as shown in the right use of their talents.",
