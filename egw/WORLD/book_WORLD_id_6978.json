    "word": "Providing Promising Contacts\n     I am carrying a heavy burden for the work and cause of God. As I see the lack of principle manifested, and the feeble faith that is shown in the message that means so much to us, I am filled with fear. I am now obliged to write some things in regard to the danger of carrying the health food business and the restaurant work to extremes. I have written that restaurants should be established as a means of bringing those who know the truth into touch with the people of the world, and of providing opportunities of reaching these people with the message of present truth. Should those attending these restaurants reform in their habits of eating, they would be better prepared to listen to arguments in favor of the truth.",
