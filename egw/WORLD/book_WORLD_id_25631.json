    "word": "Christ an Abiding Presence. The life of the true believer reveals an indwelling Saviour. The follower of Jesus is Christlike in spirit, in temper, in his meekness and humility. His faith works by love and purifies the soul. His whole life is a testimony to the world to the power of the grace of Christ. The pure doctrines of the gospel never degrade the receiver, never make him coarse, or rough, or uncourteous. The gospel refines, ennobles, and elevates, sanctifying the judgment and influencing the whole life. In true believers of the gospel, Christ is revealed as an abiding Presence.",
