    "word": "We earnestly hope that the steps taken in the future in the work in San Francisco will still be steps of progress. The work that has been done there is but a beginning. San Francisco is a world in itself, and the Lord's work there is to be broader and deeper. Souls are to be sought for. The word of the Lord is to be declared, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, that His name may be glorified.",
