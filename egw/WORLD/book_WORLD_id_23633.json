    "word": "Let us reverence God's institution, the Sabbath day; for it is the sign of our relationship to God, the sign by which we are demonstrated as His people. Let us strive, not to stand highest, but to be always obedient to all of God's requirements. It is our privilege to be loyal and obedient, true as steel in maintaining the faith. It is through our obedience, and our loyalty to the truth, that we stand before the world as subjects of Christ's kingdom.--Letter 54, 1911, p. 2. (To Sister [Dr. Lauretta] Kress, July 28, 1911.) \n\nReleased August 10, 1971.",
