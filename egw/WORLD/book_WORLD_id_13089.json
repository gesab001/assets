They would recover every soul in our world who is under Satan's banner if these poor souls would not so eagerly seek to keep out of and away from their merciful ministrations and rescuing power. Their deep and earnest love for the souls for whom Christ has died is beyond measurement. They would make these deceived souls intelligent  in regard to how they might arm themselves and break the spell which Satan has cast upon them.  {7BC 922.10} \n     If they would only look unto Jesus, and for one moment discern truly, sincerely, what love has been expressed in the sacrifice \n                                                                           923\nwhich has been made for them! If only they could see the determined efforts of Satan to eclipse by his hellish shadow every ray of light that would come into the mind and heart of persons now dead in trespasses and sins! O that they would awake from their torpor as the whole world will soon awake by the trumpet of God, which will announce His appearing! . . .  {7BC 922.11} \n     Angels are keeping back the destroying agencies; for they have an intense interest for these rebellious sons, and they want to help them to return to the fold in safety and peace, that they may finally be overcomers, and be saved, eternally saved with the family of God in heaven (MS 29, 1900).",
