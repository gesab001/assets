    "word": "To us the Lord has given a history of His work. The purity and unselfishness of His faithful servants is to be to us an example of what we may be. We are to be a chosen and peculiar people, zealous of good works, separated from all worldly ambition, working humbly with God. We are to be free from selfishness and pride. Our one desire is to be to honor God and advance His work in the world.",
