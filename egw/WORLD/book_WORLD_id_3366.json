    "word": "Some men in the Battle Creek College have a false idea as to what constitutes duty. The Lord God of heaven has caused His Holy Spirit from time to time to move upon the students in the school, that they might acknowledge Him in all their ways so that He might direct their paths. At times the manifestation of the Holy Spirit has been so decided that studies were forgotten, and the greatest Teacher the world ever knew made His voice heard, saying, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" Matthew 11:28-30.",
