    "word": "The Lord's people are not to follow the customs of worldly men, taking advantage of circumstances to gain advantage for themselves or for the work which they represent. Neither are they to follow an unfair course of action. Christ said: \"Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.... \"Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.\"",
