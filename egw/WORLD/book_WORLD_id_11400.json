    "word": "Show Points of Truth, Not Only Illustrations.--The canvassers are not obtaining that healthful experience in their work which they should have. In their handling of the books they are being educated to present before the public the beautiful cover and many illustrations rather than the points of truth contained in the books. In doing this they are patterning after the world, and they fail to make God their dependence and trust. \"What is the chaff to the wheat?\" God asks (Jeremiah 23:28).--MS 131, 1899. \n\n304",
