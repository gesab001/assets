    "word": "The Test of Doctrine \n\n     The prophet declares a truth by which we may test all doctrine. He says, \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them\" (Isaiah 8:20). Although error abounds in the world, there is no reason why men need remain in deception. The truth is plain, and when it is contrasted with error, its character may be discerned. All the subjects of God's grace may understand what is required of them. By faith we may conform our lives to the standard of righteousness, because we can appropriate to ourselves the righteousness of Christ.",
