    "word": "The city of Ephesus was the capital of the province of Asia, [AS USED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT, THE WORD ASIA DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CONTINENT OF ASIA, BUT TO A ROMAN PROVINCE WHICH EMBRACED THE WESTERN PART OF ASIA MINOR, AND OF WHICH EPHESUS WAS THE CAPITAL.] and the great commercial center of Asia Minor. Its harbor was crowded with shipping \n                                                                           129\nfrom all parts of the known world, and its streets thronged with the people of every country. It therefore presented, like Corinth, a favorable missionary field.",
