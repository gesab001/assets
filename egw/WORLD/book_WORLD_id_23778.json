    "word": "God has opened the way for us to receive help from the source of all power. He has accepted his people in the beloved. Those who thus unite with the church by baptism are sealed as men and women who have been born again, of water and of the Spirit. They have entered upon a new life. They are to be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world through lust. They are to keep themselves free from every dishonest practice. Their example is to be a continual witness to the power of heavenly grace. The spirit of truth is to control them.",
