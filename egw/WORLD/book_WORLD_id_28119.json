    "word": "Those who have not seen the recipes of how to make the health foods now on the market will make experiments with the food productions of the earth, and will be given light regarding the use of these productions. The Lord will show them what to do. He who gives skill and understanding to His people in one part of the world will give skill and understanding to His people in other parts of the world. It is His design that the food treasures of each different country shall be prepared in such a way that they can be used in the countries for which they are suited.",
