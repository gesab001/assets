    "word": "Talent, long experience, will not make men channels of light, unless they place themselves under the bright beams of the Sun of righteousness, and are called, and chosen, and prepared by the endowment of the Holy Spirit. When men who handle sacred things will humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, the Lord will lift them up. He will make them men of understanding--men rich in the grace of His Spirit. Their strong, selfish traits of character, their stubbornness, will be seen in the light shining from the Light of the world. \"I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent\" (Revelation 2:5). If you seek the Lord with all your heart, He will be found of you.",
