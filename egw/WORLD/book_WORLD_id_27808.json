    "word": "How can you appear in the last great day without the robe of the righteousness of Christ? The word is spoken; Why are they here without the wedding garment, which I gave my life to purchase for them? Take them out of my presence. It is not possible for them to love and enjoy my presence here. They have not educated themselves to be at home in heaven. It would be no place of joy to them. It does not harmonize with their habits and their tastes. Nothing here can harmonize with the characters they have formed. They have loved, admired, and glorified themselves. They did not choose to heed my invitation to come out from the world and be separate. They did not learn of me to take my yoke, to bear my burdens; they cannot appreciate the rest that I have purchased for all who are labourers together with me.",
