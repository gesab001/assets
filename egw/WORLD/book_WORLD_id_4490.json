    "word": "In a Clear, Simple Manner.--Ministers need to have a more clear, simple manner in presenting the truth as it is in Jesus. Their own minds need to comprehend the great plan of salvation more fully. Then they can carry the minds of the hearers away from earthly things to the spiritual and eternal. There are many who want to know what they must do to be saved. They want a plain and clear explanation of the steps requisite in conversion, and there should not a sermon be given unless a portion of that discourse is to especially make plain the way that sinners may come to Christ and be saved. They should point them to Christ, as did John and with touching simplicity, their hearts aglow with the love of Christ, say, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.\" Strong and earnest appeals should be made to the sinner to repent and be converted.-- Review and Herald, Feb. 22, 1887.",
