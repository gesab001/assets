    "word": "God is the owner of man. He required the human family to perfect faultless characters, and leave the results to future generations. Many in this our day act as though this were a matter of small importance; but had the human family, even after the fall of Adam, worked according to the example of Christ, every father and mother would leave their children an example how to conduct themselves so as to fulfil their obligations to God. Then the world would have been as Eden. The earth, now a desert of sin, would have rejoiced and blossomed as the rose.--Letter 143, 1900, pp. 5, 6. (To N. McClure, typed November 5, 1900.) \n\n\n                                   -4-",
