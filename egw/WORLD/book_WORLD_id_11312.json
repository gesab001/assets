    "word": "Dangers Foreseen in Vision at Salamanca.--Nov. 3, 1890, while laboring at Salamanca, N.Y., as I was in communion with God in the night season, I was taken out of and away from myself to assemblies in different States, where I bore decided testimony of reproof and warning. In Battle Creek a council of ministers and responsible men from the publishing house and other institutions was convened, and I heard those assembled, in no gentle spirit, advance sentiments and urge measures for adoption that filled me with apprehension and distress. [ONE SUCH MEASURE RECOMMENDED THAT THE SENTINEL MAGAZINE, A RELIGIOUS LIBERTY JOURNAL, CEASE PUBLICATION UNLESS ITS PAGES WERE LIMITED TO PURELY STATE-CHURCH ISSUES WITH LITTLE OR NO SPACE ALLOWED FOR PRESENTING THE DISTINCTIVE ADVENTIST MESSAGE. ELLEN WHITE OPPOSED THIS SCHEME AS OF PURELY HUMAN DEVISING: \"WE ARE NOT TO MAKE LESS PROMINENT THE SPECIAL TRUTHS THAT HAVE SEPARATED US FROM THE WORLD AND MADE US WHAT WE ARE.... WITH PEN AND VOICE WE ARE TO PROCLAIM THE TRUTH TO THE WORLD.\"--LS 329. IN RESOLVING THE ISSUE THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY COUNSEL WAS FOLLOWED BY PUBLISHING LEADERS.] \n\n\n                                                        129",
