    "word": "MR No. 263 - Ellen White's Burden in Norway and Sweden\n\n     My mind has been burdened in regard to the condition of the church in this place. When the mission fields in this country were opened before me I was shown many things in every branch of the mission that needed a different mold. There was much need of exalting the standard in this place in many respects before a correct and saving influence could go forth to other places. As the truth has been presented here it has taken persons from the world and from the churches and brought them together in church capacity; but not all who have professed to believe the truth are sanctified through it. . . .",
