    "word": "Nothing in the world is so dear to God as His church. Nothing is guarded by Him with such jealous care. The Lord has paid the ransom to save and redeem His heritage, and He is not willing that anything should separate them from Him, where He cannot protect them and prosper them for His own name's glory. He permits them to be sorely tried in the fiery furnace to separate from them and burn the dross. But His eye is upon them every moment, that as they are being purified they may not be consumed.",
