H. Kellogg.) \n\n\n     The Lord gave me special light in regard to the establishment of a health reform institution, where treatment of the sick could be carried on on altogether different lines from those existing in any institution in our world. It must be founded and conducted on Bible principles, and the institution must be the Lord's instrumentality, not to cure with drugs, but to use nature's remedies. Those who have any connection with this institution must be educated in health restoring principles.",
