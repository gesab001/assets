    "word": "We cannot make too much of the Bible as a lesson book in our schools. \"Verily, verily,\" Christ declared, \"Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. . . . I am the bread of life: he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst\" [John 6:32, 33, 35].",
