    "word": "Those who expect to be children of God are not to expect an easy time in this life. There are battles to be fought. We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness in this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. We are not left alone to engage in this conflict. Jesus Christ is the Captain of our salvation. He clothed His divinity with humanity, and took the field Himself, that He might teach us to fight the battles of the Lord. He says \"Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of Me, I delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart\" [Psalms 40:8].",
