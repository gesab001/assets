    "word": "[On Thursday, June 18, 1903, the California Medical Missionary and Benevolent Association was meeting in the chapel at the St. Helena Sanitarium, Elder A. T. Jones was in the chair. Ellen G. White had been asked to address the group at the morning meeting. First she spoke of unity among workers, then of the work to be done by medical missionaries in association with gospel workers. Then she turned to the distinctive nature of our work. We present this phase of her presentation given in the report of the meeting under the subheading \"Called Out from the World:\" This is followed by counsel on the responsibilities of medical missionary workers, a review of the times in which we live, and an appeal for high standards among Seventh-day Adventist church members.]",
