    "word": "There is danger. The workmen are separating from Jesus Christ and a worldly mold is being placed upon the work. The Lord is against all this. Let every one who is handling sacred things remember that the gospel stands in sharp antagonism to the world that lieth in wickedness. Unless the workmen are daily walking with God an influence will be exerted that will bring the displeasure of God upon the workers. Noble integrity is not practiced in all your business transactions, and those who are workers in the Office will have examples given them which may be the means of the loss of their souls.",
