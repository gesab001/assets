    "word": "The followers of Christ are to be separate from the world in principles and interests, but they are not to isolate themselves from the world. \"As thou hast sent me into the world,\" Christ said, \"even so have I also sent them into the world\" (verse 18). . . . We are not to withdraw ourselves from the world in order to escape persecution. We are to abide among men, that the savor of divine love may be as salt to preserve the world from corruption.",
