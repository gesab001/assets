    "word": "Every man and every woman in our ranks, whether a parent or not, ought to be intensely interested in the work of educating our youth for active service in the Lord's vineyard. We can not afford to allow our children to drift away into the world and to fall under the control of the enemy. Let us come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Let us do all in our power to make the Fernando school a blessing to our youth. Teachers and students, you can do much to bring this about, by wearing the yoke of Christ, daily learning of Him, His meekness and lowliness. Those who are not directly connected with the school, can help to make it a blessing, by giving it their hearty support. Thus we shall all be \"laborers together with God\", and receive the reward of the faithful, even an entrance into the school above.",
