    "word": "We don't want to make Jesus ashamed of us. There are many ways we can dishonor Christ--by the love of self, love of the world, what shall we eat, what shall we drink, and wherewithal shall we be clothed? Christ has promised to provide for us if we will only put our trust in Him. But all this will pass away if you educate yourselves to wait upon Christ, and you can reflect light to all around you.",
