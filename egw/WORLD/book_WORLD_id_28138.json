    "word": "There are those who are improvident in their handling of the Lord's property, who do many things which are really in need of undoing, who swerve the work out of the humble, self-sacrificing lines in which it should be kept. By this wrong use of money, workers together with God are brought to a standstill. In some places means have been expended profusely, while in others the workers could only stand and wait, in deep distress because they had not the means the Lord designed them to have for the work. The Lord is displeased and his name is dishonored because men work in accordance with their finite impulses. They claim as their own that which the Lord has entrusted to them to be used with equity and judgment, that the holy Sabbath may be known in all parts of the world.",
