    "word": "The children of Israel were to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations \"for a perpetual covenant.\" Exodus 31:16. The Sabbath has lost none of its meaning. It is still the sign between God and His people, and it will be so forever. Now and ever we are to stand as a distinct and peculiar people, free from all worldly policy, unembarrassed by confederation with those who have not wisdom to discern the claims of God, so plainly set forth in His law.",
