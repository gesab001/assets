    "word": "The Lord has not worked a physician in the way that He desires to work, because He says, Ye will not come to Me, that I may give your life. We look to every source to relieve except to the One who proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" (John 11:25) Christ came into our world to seek and to save that which was lost. His work as the one who heals all manner of diseases is unequalled. There are those whom the Lord uses as His co-laborers in the medical missionary work. These He is seeking to illuminate, that they may receive light and knowledge to communicate to others, and thus brighten the dark pathway of those who are oppressed by suffering and disease. If the sufferers would only come in faith to the divine Healer, they would see of the salvation of God.",
