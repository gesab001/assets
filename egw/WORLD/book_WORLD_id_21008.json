    "word": "Many who have known the truth, but who have not nourished its principles in their hearts, will become leavened with evil. This evil they do not discern. In word and act they say, \"Speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.\" We are now to call things by their right name. No longer are we to look upon unrighteousness as righteousness. Let every one be prepared to lift up the standard of truth. We are to have no fellowship with the worldly practises that have perverted the faith of some who have enjoyed great privileges and who should now be standing on vantage ground.",
