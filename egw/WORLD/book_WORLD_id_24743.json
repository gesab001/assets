    "word": "Do you confess Christ by visiting the sick, the needy, and the poor? \"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world\" [James 1:27]. Do your works testify, \"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me\"? [Galatians 2:20].",
