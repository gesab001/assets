    "word": "But in the midst of this flood of mercies, this plentitude of divine love, many hearts continue in indifference, careless, and unimpressed by the provisions of God\u2019s grace. Shall we who claim to be Christians make no effort to break the spell which Satan has cast upon these souls? Shall we let them go on in hardness of heart, without God, and without hope in the world? No; although every appeal we may make may be slighted and refused, we cannot cease to pray for them and to make tender entreaty for their souls. We must do all we can, through the aid of God\u2019s Holy Spirit, to break down the barriers by which they have sought to make themselves impregnable to the light of God\u2019s truth. We must seek to open their eyes to their blindness, to loose them from the captivity of Satan.\u2014Signs of the Times, July 17, 1893.",
