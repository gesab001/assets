    "word": "The followers of Christ are of another class altogether. \"But ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me; because I live, ye shall live also.\" \"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\" \"If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me \n\n\n                    -36- \n\nnot keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.\" The word of a human being is not to be received and believed without question. We must first ask, Do they speak in harmony with the word? Do they refuse a plain \"Thus saith the Lord\" because they see that it involves a cross?",
