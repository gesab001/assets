    "word": "We stepped on board the train at half past nine o'clock, May 26, and had the compartment to ourselves. I slept well during the night; changed cars twice. We met Brother Conradi at Maintz. He accompanied us on the rest of the journey. We changed cars at Collognes. Here we had several hours to spend, but I was too weak to go out to see anything except the Cathedral. We went inside of this building. It is a rich, costly edifice. There is but one greater in the world. It has been six hundred years in building, and there is someone at work on it constantly. It was commenced in the 13th century and is not fully completed yet. Workmen were still at work upon the inside of the building.",
