God bids you, \"Arise and shine.\" Now, just now, let every believing soul study to comprehend the words of Christ. \"Ye are the light of the world.\" It is no time now to become weakened and discouraged. This is a time for every soul to humble his heart before God in confession of mistakes and sins, and to wait upon the Lord that His spiritual strength may be renewed.",
