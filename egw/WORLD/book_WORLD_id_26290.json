    "word": "\"Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.\" Let us exalt the Lord as the One who has rightful dominion as the Supreme Ruler in His church.

We seem as men who know not what the living out of the law means. Let Christ be exalted in His mediatorial work.--Letter 18a, 1906. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nSeptember 13, 1990. Entire Letter.",
