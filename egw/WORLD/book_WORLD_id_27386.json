    "word": "\"He that taketh not up His cross and followeth after Me, is not worthy of Me.\" \"He that findeth his life shall lose it.\" He who shuns self-denial and self-sacrifice will lose his soul. He who in his ministry is true and faithful may lose his life in this world, but he will find it in the kingdom of God. When Christ comes, he will receive eternal life.",
