    "word": "God made the world, and then on the seventh day He rested, satisfied with His work. He blessed the day of His rest and set it apart as holy; and as He did this, the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy. The Sabbath is a sign between God and His people--an evidence of His love and kindness, an assurance that He will bless them in obedience. By the observance of this day they are distinguished from the disloyal, who refuse to honor God. God has taken His people into covenant relation with Himself, and has pledged Himself to fulfil His purposes for them.",
