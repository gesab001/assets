    "word": "I am instructed to say to our people: Consider the warnings God has sent regarding the closing up of this earth's history. It is not now a time for us to make a great display in large buildings. All our efforts for display will not convert one soul. When we consider that we are to be judged by our works, should we not give to the people of the world a representation in works that corresponds with the truths we proclaim? As a people we are to stand before the world to tell that time is soon to end. But our words of warning will be of no special value unless we show our faith by our works. Let us not testify by large and expensive buildings that we do not really believe what we teach. We are to provide simple, well constructed buildings for the carrying on of our work; but we must not in one place, in the erection of buildings, [use] sums so large that we would have to leave the byways and hedges unwarned of the coming of the Saviour.",
