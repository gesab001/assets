    "word": "I was directed by a messenger from heaven not to take the burden of picking up and answering all the sayings and doubts that are being put into many minds. \"Stand as the messenger of God anywhere in any place,\" I was bidden, \"and bear the testimony I shall give you. Be free. Bear the testimonies that the Lord has for you to bear in reproof, in rebuke, in the work of encouraging and lifting up the soul; 'teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.'\"",
