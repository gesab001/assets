    "word": "All who have put on the robe of Christ's righteousness will stand before Him as chosen and faithful and true. Satan has no power to pluck them out of the hand of the Saviour. Not one soul who in penitence and faith has claimed His protection will Christ permit to pass under the enemy's power. His word is pledged: \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me\" (Isaiah 27:5). The promise given to Joshua is given to all: \"If thou wilt keep my charge, . . . I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by\" (Zechariah 3:7). Angels of God will walk on either side of them, even in this world, and they will stand at last among the angels that surround the throne of God.",
