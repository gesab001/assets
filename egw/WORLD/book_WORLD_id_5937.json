    "word": "\"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" [John 1:9.] The world has had its great teachers, men of giant intellect and wonderful research, men whose utterances have stimulated thought and opened to view vast fields of knowledge; and these men have been honored as guides and benefactors of their race. But there is One who stands higher than they. \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\" \"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.\" [John 1:12, 18.]",
