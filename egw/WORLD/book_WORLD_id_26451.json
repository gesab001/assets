    "word": "Because some things have been strongly put by Dr. Kellogg, and because some have misapplied and distorted the matter, it should not force any of us in the opposite extreme.

There is a great necessity for labor being put forth to help the people, believers and unbelievers, at the present time by health talks and health publication. I cannot see why the health books should not have a prominent place as well as the other publications, notwithstanding human prejudices to the writers.

My mind has been so fully occupied with the burden upon me of getting before the people the light having special reference to these last days and the great crisis before us. The world is to be warned, and I have felt so deeply over volume 4 [of Spirit of Prophecy (The Great Controversy)] standing still as it has done, that all other consideration of books for which I was not personally responsible has not been my burden or consideration.",
