    "word": "Now, Elder Daniels, stop just where you are and consider; bring forth fruits unto righteousness such as you have not brought forth. A great deal was said about the injustice that was manifested when you did not receive credentials, and desired to labor in the cause and work of God, and could do so much good. Your credentials have been restored, and now God is waiting to \n\n\n                        [4] \n\nsee what you will do, whether you will give yourself unreservedly to his work or will please yourself. Will you connect in your work with those who will lead you to meet the world's standard rather than the standard of Christ? My heart is very sad and when I think of the state of things in Healdsburg. I know the church is not in a right condition. I know that your plans and ideas have fashioned some of its members not to their spiritual advantage, but to their injury; and the end is not yet. I was in my dream led into the church, into the college, and into your house. I sat at your table and visited your rooms, fitted up for your students, and I was led to see beneath the outward appearance, and I was very sad. I saw the working of things at present and what they would be in the future, which was far from being in God's order or according to his arrangements. I was shown some things in your family; the dangers that threatened your children of receiving a wrong stamp of character, a mould that will not be easily effaced, vanity, pride, love of dress, self-will, and anything but the meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price. May the Lord open your eyes to see and your heart to feel the necessity of an entire change.",
