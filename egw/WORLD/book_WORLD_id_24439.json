    "word": "The home is an institution of God. God designed that the family circle, father, mother, and children, should exist in this world as a firm. The father is to act as priest in his own house. He is the \"house-band'\" and what his influence will be in the home will be determined by his knowledge of the only true God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. \"When I was a child, \"Paul says, \"I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought \n\n\n                                 -189- \n\nas a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things\" (1 Corinthians 13:11). The father is to stand at the head of his family, not as an overgrown, undisciplined boy, but as a man with a manly character and with his passions controlled. He is to obtain an education in correct morals. His conduct in his home life is to be directed and restrained by the pure principles of the Word of God. Then he will grow up to the full stature of a man in Christ Jesus.",
