    "word": "The character of Wycliffe is a testimony to the educating, \n94\ntransforming power of the Holy Scriptures. It was the Bible that made him what he was. The effort to grasp the great truths of revelation imparts freshness and vigor to all the faculties. It expands the mind, sharpens the perceptions, and ripens the judgment. The study of the Bible will ennoble every thought, feeling, and aspiration as no other study can. It gives stability of purpose, patience, courage, and fortitude; it refines the character, and sanctifies the soul. An earnest, reverent study of the Scriptures\u2014bringing the mind of the student in direct contact with the infinite mind \u2014would give to the world men of stronger and more active intellect, as well as of nobler principle, than has ever resulted from the ablest training that human philosophy affords. \u201cThe entrance of Thy words,\u201d says the psalmist, \u201cgiveth light; it giveth understanding.\u201d [Psalm 119:130.]",
