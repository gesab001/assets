    "word": "We have no discouraging message for the church. Although reproofs and cautions and corrections have been made, yet the church has stood as God's instrumentality to diffuse light. The commandment-keeping people of God have sounded forth a warning to the world. . . . The church of God is a living witness, a continual testimony, to convince men if accepted, to condemn them if resisted and rejected.",
