Dec. 1, 1909. \n                                Extracts from Testimony, \n\nTo the Officers of the General Conference \n\nDear Brethren:- \n     In the night seasons I seem to be repeating the messages of warning and encouragement that I bore at the General Conference and I am instructed to urge upon our people that we, as the people of God, are not to follow the customs and fashions of the world. The world is following their leader, the great apostate; and we are to follow the Great Teacher, Jesus Christ.",
