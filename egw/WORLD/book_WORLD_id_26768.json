    "word": "As you engage heartily in this work, the converting power of God will be revealed. Your own hearts will be softened and subdued under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Christ is watching you. He is the One who has paid so great a price for your salvation. He greatly desires to bring to God all for whom He has sacrificed so much. He desires that they shall learn how to be obedient and heavenly-minded. In this world we are to prepare for a home in the city that hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.",
