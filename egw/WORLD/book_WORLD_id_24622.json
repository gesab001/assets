    "word": "In this time of danger, if Satan can work upon the unconsecrated elements of men's characters, so as to keep them quibbling and questioning until it is too late to rescue souls who are rapidly getting beyond the reach of help, he will do it. I have been shown that this is just what he is doing. He is holding men away from the work that they should do, holding them back from obedience to their Captain's orders, in subservience to their own supposed wise judgment and criticism of plans for the advancement of the work. There are many who preach discourses, lamenting the extensive and deplorable depravity now existing in the world, but they fail to do their part in shedding Heaven's light into the world's moral darkness. . . .",
