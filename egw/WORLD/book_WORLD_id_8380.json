    "word": "There are many who can help in the work of selling our periodicals. The Lord calls upon all of us to seek to save perishing souls. Satan is at work to deceive the very elect, and now is our time to work with vigilance. Our books and papers are to be brought before the notice of the people. Without delay the gospel of present truth is to be given to our cities. Shall we not arouse to our duties? All who consecrate themselves to God to work as canvassers, are assisting to give the last message of warning to the world. They are the Lord's messengers, giving to multitudes in darkness and error the glad tidings of salvation.",
