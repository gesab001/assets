    "word": "Even so the members of Christ are as he was in this world. They are the sons of God and joint heirs with Christ; and the kingdom and the dominion belong to them. The world understand not their character and holy calling. They perceive not their adoption into the family of God. Their union and fellowship with the Father and Son are not manifested to the world, and while they behold their humiliation and reproach, it does not appear what they are, or what they shall be. They are strangers. The world knows them not, and appreciate not the motives which actuate them.",
