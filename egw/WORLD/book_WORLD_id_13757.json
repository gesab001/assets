    "word": "When the Lord spoke these words to the disciples, they did not see anything that denoted that they were in an encouraging field. The seed of truth had been sown, and the harvest was about to follow. While they had been away purchasing food, Christ had preached a sermon to the woman at the well, and had sown the seed, and the harvest was to come forth speedily. She had gone back into the city of Samaria and had spread abroad the words of Christ. \n                                                                           59\nShe gave the invitation to those she met, saying with assurance, \"Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?\" Jesus knew that at the report of the woman many, out of curiosity, would come to see and to hear Him, and that many would believe on Him, and drink of the water of life that He should give them. \"And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. And many more believed because of his own word; and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.\" Thus the harvest came speedily after the sowing, for the Holy Spirit had impressed the truth upon the hearts of the Samaritans.",
