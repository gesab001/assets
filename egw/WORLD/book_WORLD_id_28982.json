    "word": "In all that we do, we are to sustain a Christlike relation to one another. We are to blend together, using every spiritual force for the carrying out of wise plans in earnest action. The gifts of God are to be used for the saving of souls. Our relations to one another are not to be governed by human standards, but by divine love, the love expressed in the gift of God to our world.",
