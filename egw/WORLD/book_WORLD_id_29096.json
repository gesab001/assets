    "word": "Jesus came to a world all seared and marred by the curse, and, at an immense sacrifice to himself, took fallen man with all his mistakes, and invited him to wear his yoke. He gives the words of invitation to all, and all who will yoke up with him will cooperate with Christ, and be one in the great plan of redemption. All who believe the great truths for this time, if sanctified through the truth, will wear the yoke of Christ. They will lift the burdens of responsibility. No man can be a wise and good soldier, unless he wears the yoke of Christ. If from self-will or a too high estimate of his own wisdom and his own methods and plans, he wants to work in his own lines, he can not be a good soldier of Christ. The Christian soldier must act in concert, step in concert, with those who are connected with him. He must not take offense if every other mind does not run in the same channel with his own. Self-restraint is always needed in order to maintain concerted action. God is not the author of confusion, but of peace. . . .",
