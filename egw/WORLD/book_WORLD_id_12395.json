    "word": "The father is seldom prepared, with his failing faculties, to properly bring up his young family. These children have peculiar traits of character, which constantly need a  counteracting influence, or they will go to certain ruin. They are not educated aright. Their discipline has too often been of the fitful impulsive kind by reason of his age. The father has been susceptible of changeable feelings. At one time over indulgent, while at another he is unwarrantably severe. Every thing in some such families is wrong, and domestic wretchedness is greatly increased. Thus a class of beings have been thrown upon the world as a burden to society. Their parents were accountable in a great degree for the characters developed by their children, which are transmitted from generation to generation.",
