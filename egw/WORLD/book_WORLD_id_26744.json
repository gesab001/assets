    "word": "Intemperance is seen on every side. What are you doing to overcome it? What are you doing to baffle the efforts of the enemy? Are you standing for the right as did Daniel in the courts of Babylon? He was tempted, but he would not swerve from the principles of right. He refused to partake of the food and wine from the king's table, and requested that he and his companions be allowed a simpler diet. His request was granted, and ten days' trial revealed that the Hebrew youth possessed health and fairness of countenance which were not possessed by those who had eaten of the food from the king's table. Let us be Daniels in this world of temptation and trial, standing steadfastly for the right because it is right.",
