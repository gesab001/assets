    "word": "The Lord is grieved because so many of those who profess to believe in Him are not true believers. They will perish with the wicked unless they separate themselves from their worldly associates and follow the example of Christ. God wants every believer on Norfolk Island to be a representative of the truth for this time. My brother, my sister, if you will fulfill His purpose for you, He will give you His peace. But He is grieved because, though claiming to be His sons and daughters, you do not do His will. He desires you to be true Christians. But this many of you are not. You grieve the Holy Spirit, and give occasion for the truth to be evil spoken of.",
