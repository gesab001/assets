    "word": "In doing this work a fourfold blessing will be realized,--a blessing to our schools, to the world, to the \n\n\n                        -5- \n\nchurch, and to ourselves. While means will be gathered for the relief of the schools, we shall sow the seeds of truth in many souls who will receive it, and be saved by it. The self-sacrificing efforts put forth by the members of our churches, will prove a means of uniting them, that they may be sanctified, body, soul, and spirit, as vessels unto honor, prepared to receive the Holy Spirit which God will impart. Those who will seek to do God's will, laying out every talent to the best advantage, will become wise in working for the kingdom of God. They will learn lessons of the greatest consequence to them, and they will feel the highest happiness of a rational mind. Peace, grace, and power of intellect will be given unto them.",
