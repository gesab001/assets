    "word": "\"Train,\" Not \"Tell.\"--To parents is committed the great work of educating and training their children for the future, immortal life. Many fathers and mothers seem to think that if they feed and clothe their little ones, and educate them according to the standard of the world, they have done their duty. They are too much occupied with business or pleasure to make the education of their children the study of their lives. They do not seek to train them so that they will employ their talents for the honor of their Redeemer. Solomon did not say, \"Tell a child the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\" But, \"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\" \n                                                                           39",
