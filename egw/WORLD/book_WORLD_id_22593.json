    "word": "The curse which fell upon the fig-tree because it bore no fruit, now threatens to fall upon the church at Battle Creek. God has planted important institutions among you, yet you have not been the more circumspect, lest your influence shall be on the wrong side. W. C. Gage, C. W. Stone, J. H. Kellogg, and others who occupy responsible positions, have not stood up in their integrity to resist the spirit and influence of the world. They have been cautioned and reproved, but they have at times been far more ready to yield to a worldly influence than to the Spirit of God. \n                                                                           71",
