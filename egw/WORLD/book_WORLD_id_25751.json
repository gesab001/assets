    "word": "Should you connect with any sanitarium as you now are, you would dishonor God by your irreligious, worldly aspirations. Self is determined to rule in your life. Your only hope is to crucify self. When the heart is once given unreservedly to God, it will be softened and subdued. You are not your own, for you have been bought with a price. Will you not die to self and consecrate your life to Christ? This will mean a severe struggle, but God will be your helper as you seek to do His will.",
