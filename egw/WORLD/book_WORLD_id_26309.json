    "word": "Day by day I am given an assurance of the love of God. \"He that heareth My word,\" Christ says, \"and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.\" \"These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through His name,\" I long to proclaim the gospel of good news, the glad tidings of great joy. I am anxious to present to our people the message that the Lord has given me, that Christ has made us His own, that He has bought us with a price beyond computation. The Saviour declared, \"I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on Me should not abide in darkness.\" He would have all heed His invitation, \"Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.\" God presents salvation to all; He gives it to those who believe.",
