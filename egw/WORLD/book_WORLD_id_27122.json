    "word": "The heavenly Messenger turned to you, and said, \"Unless you are converted and become as a little child, you will walk in self-sufficiency and self-confidence, and will estrange yourself from God. The Lord has given you encouragement, but you are not in simplicity co-operating with Him. You do not hunger for the greatness of His power. Did God lead you to bind yourself up with worldly men, who do not obey His commands? What has drawn this veil over your spiritual eyesight, that you do not honor and glorify God, but walk in a way that glorifies self?\"",
