    "word": "Let each put the question to his own heart. \"How have we fallen into this state of spiritual feebleness and dissension? Have we not brought upon ourselves the frown of God because our actions do not correspond with our faith? Have we not been seeking the friendship and applause \n\n                      [2] \n\nof the world, rather than the presence of Christ and a deeper knowledge of his will?\" Examine your own hearts, judge your own course. Consider what associates you are choosing. Do you seek the company of the wise, or are you willing to choose worldly associates, companions who fear not God, and obey not the gospel?\"",
