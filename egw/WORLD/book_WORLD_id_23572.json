    "word": "I am commissioned to speak to all those who are engaged as physicians in our institutions. A reformation is required in regard to the management of these institutions. They are not to be conducted as the world would conduct them. . . . The work done in our medical institutions is to correspond with the words \"medical missionary work.\" We do not want the Lord to think ill of us because we misrepresent the work of Christ. God has not given us permission to do a work which will not bear the investigation of the judgment.--Letter 232, 1899, pp. 1-7, 9, 10. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, November 10, 1899.)",
