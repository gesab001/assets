    "word": "We find in our world everywhere those who are oppressed and are laboring under discouragement. Our Saviour has invited such to come unto Him. And why do they not comply? The reason is that they are separated from Jesus Christ. If they would only come to Him they would find comfort. But it is a difficult matter to believe. Should we exercise faith then we should accept the invitation and take the yoke of Christ. But instead of taking the yoke of Christ many take their own yokes and thus find themselves in difficulty.",
