    "word": "Brother Arthur, I feel the most tender interest in you and in your connection with the Seventh-day Adventists. I am aware that you have seen among our people many things of an objectionable nature. You have seen them cherishing that which, considering the sacredness of their faith, they \n\n\n                                   -124- \n\nshould not tolerate. The Lord Jesus looks upon you very tenderly, with great compassion and love. There is a narrow path for you to travel and a strait gate for you to pass through. And One is your Leader, even Christ. Remember always that He is acquainted with every temptation that comes to you. Ever trust Him and ever follow Him in meekness and humility. He is able to do as He has promised. \"Behold the Lamb of God,\" John said, \"which taketh away the sin of the world\" [John 1:29].",
