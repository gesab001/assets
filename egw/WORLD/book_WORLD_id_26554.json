    "word": "Our sisters cannot afford to use their God-given time on unimportant things which will give them no spiritual strength, but will, if they continue, separate them from God. It is a solemn thing to die, but it is a far more solemn thing to live. Here is a world that is lying in wickedness around us, and what are we, as men and women who claim to be sons and daughters of God, doing to save the souls of those around us? God requires that we shall give back to Him in willing service all the powers that He has given to us. Let us look forward to the day of final reckoning. How will our case stand in that day. Will it make us unhappy then that we have served God and kept His commandments? God has given us rules to regulate our lives so that we shall have His care and protection in this life.",
