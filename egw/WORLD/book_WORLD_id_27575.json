    "word": "We may stand close to the side of Jesus. Let none in his pride of self opinion shirk one hard lesson or lose the blessing of one hard discipline. Humble yourselves under the hand of God, warn all that they do not in stubbornness choose their own way and act like undisciplined, untrained children. \n                                                                           1003\nWhatever be our condition in life, our business, we have a sure Guide. Whatever be our condition, He is our Counselor. Whatever be our loneliness, He is our Friend in Whom we may ever trust. When voices on every hand are heard to lead us to wander away into false paths there is a voice that is true that is heard, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. You may stop your contention over little items and differences. \"Believe in me; I am the true Shepherd.\" \"I and my Father are one. I in them, and they in me.\" \"And that the world may believe that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.\"",
