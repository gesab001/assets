    "word": "In the City of God \u201cthere shall be no night.\u201d None will need or desire repose. There will be no weariness in doing the will of God and offering praise to His name. We shall ever feel the freshness of the morning and shall ever be far from its close. . . . All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God\u2019s redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless flight to worlds afar\u2014worlds that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle of human woe and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul. . . .",
