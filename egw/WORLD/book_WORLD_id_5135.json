    "word": "He would employ us as agents to communicate the light of His word to the world. If we improved the light given us of God by diffusing it to others, we shall have increased light; for to him \"that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.\" It is at our own option as to what we shall do with the light God has given. We may walk in it, or \n                                                                           216\nrefuse to follow in the steps of Christ, and thus extinguish our light.",
