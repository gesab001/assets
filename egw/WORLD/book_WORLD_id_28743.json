    "word": "We have grant and mighty truths, and in presenting these truths to the world there is a field for the exercise of the highest capabilities. But the Lord will scorn your unwilling service. The truth is grand, eternal, because it proceeds from Him who is truth, and righteousness. And He will not accept the half-hearted, reluctant service of one of you. Unless you have a love for Jesus, unless you receive in your heart the Bible truth, and Christ as your personal Saviour, He will not accept your worthless sacrifice or your service.",
