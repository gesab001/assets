    "word": "Sacredness of the Family Circle--At the feasts which the world provides, the richest provisions are usually placed before the guests first, but on this occasion [the marriage at Cana] the best was kept till the last. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine, he at once detected the difference between this and that which he had before drunk. It was superior, the best he had ever placed in his lips. Calling the bridegroom, he \"saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set \n\n\n                                  -188- \n\nforth good wine: and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now\" (John 2:10)",
