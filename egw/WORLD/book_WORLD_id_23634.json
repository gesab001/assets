    "word": "MR No. 279 - The Sabbath\n\n     The Sabbath of the fourth commandment, sanctified by God, was given to man as the memorial of the creation of the world and all things therein. Ever since the institution of the Sabbath in Eden, Satan has made a determined effort to destroy this memorial, and in its stead to institute a spurious sabbath, in order that the memorial of God's great and wonderful works might be lost from the mind, and there be brought about a worldwide apostasy against God's law. He well knows that, by leading men and women to disregard the fourth commandment, he has placed them on his side of the controversy; for God says, \"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.--Ms 24, 1891, p. 7. (Diary, \"Satan's Efforts to Destroy the Sabbath Memorial of the Creation,\" typed February, 1903.)",
