    "word": "The glory of the world to come is eclipsed by the corruptible things of earth. \"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" Matthew 6:21. Your thoughts, your plans, your motives, will have an earthly mold, and your soul will be defiled with covetousness and selfishness. \"What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" Mark 8:36. The day is coming when the idols of silver and gold will be cast to the moles and to the bats, and the rich men will weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon them. . . .",
