    "word": "The members of the family all need to see their spiritual necessities, that they may not be led and controlled by pride, worldliness, ungodliness which will not elevate them in the scale of moral worth in this life, and will not secure to them the future immortal life. Every one of this family need to carefully consider the change that must take place in the character and in their relation to God and the claims He has upon them. God has claims upon them, which if they respond to these claims, they will be true to all their responsibility in persevering integrity towards their fellow men. God alone can open your eyes to see your danger and to call a halt now where you are and to turn square about.",
