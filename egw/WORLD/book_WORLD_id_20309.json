    "word": "Well, bless the Lord, dear brethren and sisters, it is an extra meeting for those who have the seal of the living God [Revelation 14:3.] This temple was supported by seven pillars, all of transparent gold, set with pearls most glorious. The glorious things I saw there, I cannot describe to you. O, that I could talk in the language of Canaan, then could I tell a little of the glory of the upper world; but, if faithful, you soon will know all about it. I saw there the tables of stone in which the names of the 144,000 were engraved in letters of gold; after we had beheld the glory of the temple, we went out. Then Jesus left us, and went to the city; soon, we heard his lovely voice again, saying-- \"Come my people, you have come out of great tribulation, and done my will; suffered for me; come in to supper, for I will gird myself, and serve you.\" [Luke 12:37.] We shouted Hallelujah, glory, and entered into the city . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . And I saw a table of pure silver, it was many miles in length, yet our eyes could extend over it. And I saw the fruit of the tree of life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranates, grapes, and many other kinds of fruit. We all reclined at the table. I asked Jesus to let me eat of the fruit. He said, not now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land, go back to earth no more. But in a little while, if faithful, you shall both eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and drink of the water of the fountain; and he said, you must go back to the earth again, and relate to others, what I have revealed to you. Then an angel bore me gently down to this dark \n                                                                           18\nworld. Sometimes I think I cannot stay here any longer, all things of earth look so dreary--I feel very lonely here, for I have seen a better land. O, that I had wings like a dove, then would I fly away, and be at rest. \n\n                                               -",
