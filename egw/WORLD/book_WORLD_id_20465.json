    "word": "It is here, right here in the world, that our talents are to be used. We are to lead souls to \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). It is our work, and should be our pleasure, to present in our lives the unsearchable riches of Christ. We may make daily progress in the path of holiness, and still find greater heights to be reached; but every stretch of the spiritual muscles, every tax on heart and brain, will bring to light the abundance of the supply of grace essential for us as we advance. The more we contemplate eternal things, the more we shall reveal the merits of a Saviour's sacrifice, the protection of His righteousness, the fullness of His wisdom, and His power to present us before the Father without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.--Youth's Instructor, Nov. 30, 1899.",
