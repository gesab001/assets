    "word": "In the wilderness, Christ met the great leading temptations that would assail humanity. There, singlehanded, He encountered the wily, subtle foe, and overcame him. The first great temptation was upon appetite; the second, presumption; the third, love of the world. The thrones and kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, were offered to Christ. Satan came with worldly honor, wealth, and the pleasures of life, and presented them in the most attractive light to allure and deceive. \u201cAll these things,\u201d said he to Christ, \u201cwill I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.\u201d Yet Christ repelled the wily foe, and came off victor. . . .",
