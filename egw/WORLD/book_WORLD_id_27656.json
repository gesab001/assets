    "word": "The wave of truth following from the infinitely wise God to his frail human agents is not subject to the will of man. God prescribes the terms, and specifies every condition upon which we may receive his gifts. With the one party there is infinite power, wisdom, mercy, and goodness; with the other party is weakness, and ignorance, and helplessness and sin. Even the faculties and resources of men, which God will accept in co-operation with the divine, are ours only in trust. In the great condescension of God to admit human finite beings as co-laborers in the saving of the world, he makes it a condition that the human agent shall receive counsel from God, diligently obeying every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. And our success in the religious life will be according to the integrity and thoroughness with which these conditions are fulfilled.",
