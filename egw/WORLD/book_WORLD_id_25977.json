    "word": "\"With long life will I satisfy\" you, saith the Lord. \"Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee\" [Hebrews 13:5]. God has been true to you, but it is you that have forsaken God. You cannot extinguish your lamp so that it shall not be a light to the world, and yet walk in the light. He who shall choose to walk in the light of the fire of his own kindling, shall lie down in sorrow. \n\n\n                                    -391-",
