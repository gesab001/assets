    "word": "In regard to this school here at Huntsville, I wish to say that for the past two or three years I have been receiving instruction in regard to it-- what it should be, and what those who come here as students are to become. All that is done by those connected with this school, whether they be white or black, is to be done with the realization that this is the Lord's institution, in which the students are to be taught how to cultivate the land, and how to labor for the uplifting of their own people. They are to work with such earnestness and perseverance that the farm will bear testimony, to the world, to angels, and to men, to the fidelity with which this donation of land has been cared for. This is the Lord's land, and it is to bear fruit to His glory. Those who attend this school, to be taught in right lines, on the farm or in the school, are to live in close connection with God.",
