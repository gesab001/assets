    "word": "The great King Himself hath made a marriage for His Son. He hath sent forth His servants for many hundreds of years, saying, \"Come, for all things are ready.\" But how little do the [people of the] world heed the invitation! They make light of it and go their ways to their worldly pursuits and worldly pleasures, the same as they have done for centuries. But the King sendeth forth His armies and destroys those murders and burns up their city, and we are told in the ninth chapter of Daniel, the 26th verse, that \"the people of the Prince that shall come shall destroy the city...; and the end thereof shall be with a flood.\"",
