    "word": "Brethren, we need more of God's wisdom, less of human judgment. More of His power should be brought into this institution. I believe it is wrong for you to talk disparagingly in regard to the outlook for the prosperity of this institution. The St. Helena Sanitarium must grow to the full stature of what God designs it to be. Does He desire His institutions in one place to reach perfection, and not in another place? He is no respecter of persons. He desires us, His instrumentalities, to turn from humanity to divinity. When Christ was in this world, He encircled humanity with His long human arm, while with His divine arm He reached the throne of the Infinite.",
