    "word": "Temptations will come to the newly converted soul. Old habits and practices will seek for the mastery; but in the name of Jesus, resist every temptation. Christ knows your trials, and will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able to resist. Jesus partook of our human nature, and was tempted in all points like as we are. And we may look to Jesus for His tenderest sympathy and be encouraged to persevere, putting our whole trust in Him who has said, \"Be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.\"",
