    "word": "The medical missionary work is to burst all barriers. All are invited to take a part in it, and help where help is needed. The wealthy are to be reached, and their sympathy and assistance solicited; for are they not the Lord's stewards? Idle children are to be instructed; they are to enlist in the army of workers to help the sick and suffering. Train the children, for they are the Lord's heritage. As the children sang in the temple courts, \"Hosanna to the Highest, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,\" so in these days children's voices will be raised to give the last message of warning to a perishing world. We are not to shut ourselves away from our fellow beings. We are to be in the world, while not of the world.",
