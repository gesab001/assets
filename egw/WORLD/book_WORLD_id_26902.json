    "word": "Here is brought to view the change that must take place in the heart. And \"faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\" The Scriptures are the great agency in this transformation. Christ prayed, \"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth\" [John 17:17]. In this great work we are laborers together with God. With the divine agency there is to be the cooperation of the human instrument. To each of His followers Christ says, \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" [Matthew 28:18-20].",
