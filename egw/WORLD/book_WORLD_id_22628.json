    "word": "I was shown that Bro. C. Russell is buried up in the rubbish of the world. He cannot afford time to serve God. He cannot afford time to earnestly study and pray to know what the Lord would have him do. His talent is buried in the earth. The cares of this life have swallowed up eternal considerations with him. The kingdom of God and the righteousness of Christ are secondary with him. He loves business, but I saw, that unless he changed his course, the hand of God would be against him. He may gather, but God will scatter. He could do good.",
