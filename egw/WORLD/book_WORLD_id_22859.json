    "word": "My brethren and sisters, remember that one day you will stand before the Lord of all the earth, to answer for the deeds done in the body. Then your work will appear as it really is. The vineyard is large, and the Lord is calling for laborers. Do not allow anything to keep you from the work of soul-saving. The canvassing work is a most successful way of saving souls. Will you not try it? Will you not do what you can to circulate the books that the Lord has said should be sown broadcast through the world? Will you not place them in the homes of as many as possible? \n                                                                           9\nThink of how great a work can be done if a large number of believers will unite in an effort to place before the people, by the circulation of these books, the light that the Lord has committed to us to be given them.",
