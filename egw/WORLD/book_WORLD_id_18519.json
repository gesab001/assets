    "word": "The character of Christ is an infinitely perfect character. The Word declares Him. He is lifted up and proclaimed as the One who gave His life for the life of the world. . . . Christ gave His own life, that all the disloyal and disobedient might realize the truth of the promise given in the first chapter of John: \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1:12). Tell it over and over again. We may become the sons of God, members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. All who accept Jesus Christ and hold the beginning of their confidence firm unto the end will be heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ to \"an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away.\"",
