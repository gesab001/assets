    "word": "Jesus said, \"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations\" (Matthew 24:14). His kingdom will not come until the good tidings of His grace have been carried to all the earth. Hence, as we give ourselves to God, and win other souls to Him, we hasten the coming of His Kingdom. Only those who devote themselves to His service ... pray in sincerity, \"Thy kingdom come.\" . . .",
