    "word": "There is another and more important question that should engage the attention of the churches of today. The apostle Paul declares that \"all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.\" [2 Timothy 3:12.] Why is it, then, that persecution seems in a great degree to slumber?--The only reason is, that the church has conformed to the world's standard, and \n                                                                           50\ntherefore awakens no opposition. The religion current in our day is not of the pure and holy character which marked the Christian faith in the days of Christ and his apostles. It is only because of the spirit of compromise with sin, because the great truths of the word of God are so indifferently regarded, because there is so little vital godliness in the church, that Christianity is apparently so popular with the world. Let there be a revival of the faith and power of the early church, and the spirit of persecution will be revived, and the fires of persecution will be rekindled.",
