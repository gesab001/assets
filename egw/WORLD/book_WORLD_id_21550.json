    "word": "Need of reform in our schools. \n\n\n     \"It is so easy to drift into worldly plans, methods, and customs, and have no more thought of the time in which we live, or of the great work to be accomplished, than had the people in Noah's day. Our institutions are in danger of traveling over the same ground as did the Jews, conforming to customs, practices, and traditions which God has not given. With tenacity and firmness, some cling to old habits and a love of various studies which are not essential, as if the salvation of both teachers and students depended upon those studies which for years have found a place in the schools. By doing this, they turn away from the special light God has given in his Word and give to the students a deficient education.\" --U.T., \"The need of Reform in Educational work.\"",
