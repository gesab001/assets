    "word": "God was to be manifest in Christ, \u201creconciling the world unto himself.\u201d Man had become so degraded by sin that it was impossible for him, in himself, to come into harmony with Him whose nature is purity and goodness. But Christ, after having redeemed man from the condemnation of the law, could impart divine power, to unite with human effort. Thus by repentance toward God and faith in Christ, the fallen children of Adam might once more become \u201csons of God.\u201d",
