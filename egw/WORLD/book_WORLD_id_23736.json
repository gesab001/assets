    "word": "Here are the credentials we are to bear to the world, that the Lord hath sent His Son, Jesus, \"that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" When so much importance is attached to the unity of believers, why is there so little effort to preserve unity? Why are not the words of our Saviour more decidedly practiced?

Why present these differences conspicuously before the world?",
