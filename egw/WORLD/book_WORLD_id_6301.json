    "word": "The great sin charged against Babylon is, that she \u201cmade all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\u201d This cup of intoxication which she presents to the world, represents the false doctrines that she has accepted as the result of her unlawful connection with the great ones of the earth. Friendship with the world corrupts her faith, and in her turn she exerts a corrupting influence upon the world by teaching doctrines which are opposed to the plainest statements of Holy Writ.",
