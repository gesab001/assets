    "word": "Action gives power. Entire harmony pervades the universe of God. The physical formation of the world and all the creatures God has made must come into your study, and in this study you will find that all nature forbids inaction. You need to understand the human organism, the Lord's wonderful machinery. All parts of this machinery must be exercised harmoniously, proportionate with the exercise of the brain nerve power. All parts of the human machinery must have action.",
