    "word": "Christ declares, \"Every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth.\" Here is stated a positive fact. Let us use this fact as a sure promise. It is the exposition of the law of divine government, a law sure and unfailing, establishing a connection between human and divine agency as we ask for the Holy Spirit and receive what we ask for. Oh, \n\n\n                                     -193- \n\nwhat a world of promises we have in the Word of God! Whosoever has sought the gift in faith, believing, has always received it, and can testify to the working of the Holy Spirit upon the heart and life character.",
