W., July 2, 1894. \n     Many go to Battle Creek expecting to find an influence similar to that of heaven, but they soon find practises not at all in accordance with their ideas of truth and the separate, peculiar people who are to represent the most pure, holy principles of religion that were ever given to the world. Many have been led to walk in false paths through being brought into connection with those who were not consecrated, self-denying followers of Jesus Christ. . . .",
