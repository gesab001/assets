    "word": "O, how different are the standards by which God and man measure character. God sees many temptations resisted of which the world, and even near friends, never know--temptations in the home, in the heart. He sees the soul's humility in view of its own weakness, the sincere repentance over even a thought that is evil. He sees the whole-hearted devotion to His service. He has noted the hours of hard battle with self--battle that won the victory. All this God and angels know. A book of remembrance is written for them that fear the Lord and that think upon His name.",
