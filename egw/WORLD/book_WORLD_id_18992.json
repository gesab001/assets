    "word": "The work of Christ in the heart does not destroy man's powers. Christ directs, strengthens, ennobles, and sanctifies the faculties of the soul. It is through personal acquaintance with Him that we become qualified to represent His character to the world. John says, \"As many as receive him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1:12). And again, \"Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace\" (verse 16).",
