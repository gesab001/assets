    "word": "Paul writes to the Romans, \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and perfect, will of God. Romans 12:1, 2. This entire chapter is a lesson which I entreat all who claim to be members of the body of Christ to study.",
