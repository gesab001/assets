    "word": "Not one tittle of God's holy law is to be treated lightly or disrespectfully. Those who transgress a \"Thus saith the Lord,\" stand under the banner of the prince of darkness, in rebellion against their Maker and their Redeemer. They claim the promises given to the obedient, saying, The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are we, while they dishonor God by misrepresenting His character, by doing the very things He has told them not to do. They set up a standard which God has not given. Their example is misleading, their influence corrupting. They are not lights in the world, for they do not follow the principles of righteousness.",
