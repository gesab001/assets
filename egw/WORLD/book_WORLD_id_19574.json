    "word": "Angelic Presences While Ellen White Was Awake\n     When I awoke and looked out of the window, I saw two white clouds. Then I fell asleep again; and in my dreams these words were spoken to me: \u201cLook at these\n259\nclouds. It was just such clouds as these that enshrouded the heavenly host who proclaimed to the shepherds the birth of the world's Redeemer.\u201d I awoke and looked out of the car window again, and there were the two large white clouds, as white as snow. They were distinct, separate clouds, but one would approach and touch the other, and for a moment they would blend together; then they would separate, and remain as distinct as before. They did not disappear, but continued in sight throughout the forenoon. At twelve o'clock we changed cars, and I did not see the clouds any more.",
