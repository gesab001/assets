    "word": "I have tried in the fear of God to set before his people their danger and their sins; and have endeavored to the best of my feeble powers to arouse them. I have stated startling things, which, if they had believed, would have caused them distress and terror, and led them to zeal in repenting of their sins and iniquities. I have stated before them that, from what was shown me, but a small number of those now professing to believe the truth, would eventually be saved --not because they cannot be saved, but because they will not be saved in God's own appointed way. The way marked out by our divine Lord was too narrow and the gate too strait to admit them with their grasp upon the world, or while cherishing selfishness, or any corruption. All these there was no room for, and there are but few who will consent to part with these things, that they may pass the narrow way, and enter the strait gate.",
