    "word": "Christ would have every one possess in abundance, the grace of heaven. He desires that His joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. Every soul is to discipline himself in strict, faithful service, just as verily out of meeting as in meeting. You are in full view of the heavenly angels, and every faithful disciple may be, if he will as was Ezra before the king. The hand of God is upon all these for good who seek Him, but His power and His wrath are against those who forsake Him, and who trust in the help and friendship of the world, going to the god of Ekron to inquire, and heeding not the Counsel of the living God.",
