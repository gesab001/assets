    "word": "Of himself, what can man accomplish in the great work set forth by the infinite God? Christ says: \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" John 15:5. He came to our world to show men how to do the work given them by God, and He says to us: \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" Matthew 11:28-30. Why is Christ's yoke easy and His burden light? Because He bore the weight of it upon the cross of Calvary.",
