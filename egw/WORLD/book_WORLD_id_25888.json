    "word": "I beseech you to be much with God in prayer. You can do your work successfully with Jesus. He will show you how to work. When He accomplished one work in His mission, He advanced and addressed Himself to another. \"This commandment have I received of My Father.\" In everything that Christ did in the world He consulted the will of God, fulfilling the purpose and design of God in all His earthly life. Thus He represented the will of our heavenly Father toward man.",
