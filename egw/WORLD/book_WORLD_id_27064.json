    "word": "We are delivering sermons in every building we erect, and these things are taken as testimonies borne of our faith, while these very buildings testify that we are not expecting to move soon from this world to the heavenly. As this representation of the matter was presented before me, I could not rest. I determined to present it as it was presented to me, and to urge our people to show their faith by their works. If we will work humbly and in the fear of God, He will work with our efforts to impress men and women with the truths of the message, and they in turn will testify to the faith they hold.",
