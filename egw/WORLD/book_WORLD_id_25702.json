    "word": "It greatly dishonors God for anyone in any way to disregard the great salvation brought to mankind at so great a cost, even the life of the only begotten Son of God. Men and women have no right to refuse the invitation of Him who has died for their redemption. Christ offers life eternal to those who choose to be obedient and submissive to God's will in this life. By bearing the yoke of willing obedience, they testify to worlds unfallen, to angels, and to men, that they have accepted Christ as their Ruler, and are conforming their lives in accordance with His will. The Lord calls souls to repent and be converted.",
