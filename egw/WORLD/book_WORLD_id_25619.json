    "word": "Today the world is mad; an insanity is upon them, which is hurrying them on to eternal ruin. Every species of indulgence prevails, and men become so infatuated with vice that they will not listen to warnings or appeals.

Men need to be aroused to realize the solemnity of the time and the nearness of the day when human probation shall be ended.",
