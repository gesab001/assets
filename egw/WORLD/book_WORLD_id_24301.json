    "word": "Christ a Sinless Being Sent From Heaven.--God did for us the very best thing that He could do when He sent from heaven a sinless Being to manifest to this world of sin what those who are saved must be in character-- pure, holy, and undefiled, having Christ formed within. He sent His ideal in His Son, and bade men build characters in harmony with this ideal. And in all His ministry, all His self-denial and self-sacrifice, Christ's object was to reveal God to the world. It was not merely a theory of the excellence of divine mercy that was to be presented to the world. Christ came, and in the likeness of man wrought out before the world a perfect character, that the world may be without excuse.--Letter 58, 1906, p. 3. (To Brethren Washburn, Prescott, Daniells, and Colcord, January 16, 1900.)",
