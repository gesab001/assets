    "word": "The unity, the harmony, that should exist among the disciples of Christ, is described in these words: \"That they may be one, as we are.\" But how many there are who draw off, and seem to think that they have learned all they need to learn. Brethren, where is your burden for these? Have you been to them to invite them to come and seek God, and hear the word that has been precious to you? Are you enjoying light, and still willing to let others remain in darkness? We want all our brethren to have the same blessing that we have. Those who choose to stand on the outskirts of the camp, cannot know what is going on in the inner circle. They must come right into the inner courts, for as a people we must be united in faith and purpose. Jesus has prayed that his disciples all might be one--\"As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.\" It is through this unity that we are to convince the world of the mission of Christ, and bear our divine credentials to the world. \"And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.\" This is what we want. This is what we are waiting for,--more of the glory of Christ to lighten our pathway, that we may go forth with that glory shining in our countenances, that we may make an impression upon those with whom we shall come in contact.",
