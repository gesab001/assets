    "word": "How inestimably precious are the gifts of God--the graces of His Spirit--and we shall not shrink from the trying, testing process, be it ever so painful or humiliating to us. How easy would be the way to heaven if there were no self-denial or cross! How worldlings would rush in the way, and hypocrites would travel in it without number! Thank God for the cross, the self-denial. The ignominy and shame our Saviour endured for us is none too humiliating for those saved by the purchase of His blood. Heaven will indeed be cheap enough.--Letter 9, April 5, 1873, to a \"Sister Billet,\" of San Francisco, California.",
