    "word": "Stand in defense of the truth; exalt the truth. God has given the erring one every encouragement to turn fully to him. Our brother has been following his perverted judgement, and his soul has been lifted up into vanity; but he should not be personally attacked, because it is not the right thing to do, to open those opposition charges before the world. Keep the affirmative of truth, as did Paul in his charge to Timothy: \"Preach the Word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts, shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears.\"",
