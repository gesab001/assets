    "word": "From the ambitious favorites of the world, Christ turned to those they disowned, pronouncing all blessed who received His light and life. To the poor in spirit, the meek, the lowly, the sorrowful, the despised, the persecuted, He opens His arms of refuge, saying, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you\"--the yoke of submission--\"and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\"",
