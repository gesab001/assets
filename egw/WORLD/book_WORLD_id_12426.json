I turned to look for the Advent people in the world, but could not find them, when a voice said to me, \"Look again, and look a little higher.\" At this I raised my eyes, and saw a straight and narrow path, cast up high above the world. On this path the Adventist people were traveling to the city, which was at the farther end of the path.--Early Writings, p. 14.",
