    "word": "When Christians work as the Head of the church worked, they will not be constantly contriving how they can use the Lord's money for their own pleasure. Is it not honor enough for them to be cooperating with the world's Redeemer? Worldly schemes, worldly investments, made to please and glorify self, bring no returns worth the having. God condemns them, and what God condemns is not safe for any living soul to practice.",
