    "word": "So Run That Ye May Obtain.--There are precious victories to gain; and the victors in this contest against appetite and every worldly lust will receive a crown of life that fadeth not away, a blessed home in that city whose gates are of pearl and whose foundations are of precious stones. Is not this prize worth striving for? Is it not worth every effort that we can make? Then let us so run that we may obtain.--Signs of the Times, Sept. 1, 1887. \n                                                                           151",
