    "word": "When Christ came to this world He found the Jewish people burdened with a heavy weight of traditions and ceremonies which the religious teachers had handed down from generation to generation. So great was the mass of tradition brought in that the commandments of God were made of none effect. Today there are those who are doing a work similar to that done by the Jewish teachers. They are dishonoring the law of God by their extreme teaching. There are those who say that nothing, not even insects, should be killed. God has not entrusted any such message to His people. It is possible to stretch the command \"Thou shalt not kill\" to any limit, but it is not according to sound reasoning to do this. Those who do it have not learned in the school of Christ.",
