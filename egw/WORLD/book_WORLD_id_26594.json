    "word": "We want to learn in the school of Christ meekness and lowliness of heart, and from whom are we to learn these lessons? Jesus says, \"I am meek and lowly of heart.\" \"Learn of Me.\" Now, if there is anything in us like self, then Christ cannot dwell there. We want to represent Christ to the world. We must have self hid with Christ in God, and when this is the case we will represent Christ to the world. Oh, there is something wonderful about it--He loves us as He loves His Son [see John 17:23]. Just think of it--loves us as He does His Son! This is wonderful, wonderful. In Him we have all heaven presented to us, and the more we see in Jesus the less we see that is good in self.",
