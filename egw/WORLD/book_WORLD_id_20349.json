    "word": "Those who do the words of Christ will perfect a Christian character, because Christ's will is their will. Thus is Christ formed within, the hope of glory. They are beholding, as in a glass, the glory of God. By our making Christ the subject of meditation, He will become the subject of conversation; and by beholding, we will actually be changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord. Man, fallen man, may be transformed by the renewing of the mind, so that he can \"prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\" How does he prove this? By the Holy Spirit taking possession of his mind, spirit, heart, and character. Where does the proving come in? \"We are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men\" (1 Corinthians 4:9).",
