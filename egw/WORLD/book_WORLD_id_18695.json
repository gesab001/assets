    "word": "What will the human agent do to have the privilege of cooperating with God? Will he forsake all that he has rather than forsake Christ? . . . Will he suffer persecution for the truth's sake? Reproach and persecution have separated many souls from heaven, but never a soul from the love of Christ. Never yet did persecution drive the soul who was indeed a lover of Jesus Christ away from Him. The love of Jesus in the soul is all-absorbing, for that great love wherewith God hath loved us, revealed in giving Christ to us, is beyond a parallel. \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.\" . . .",
