This word, if received into your life, will refine and sanctify you, and increase your usefulness. It is your privilege to help those who need help, to speak words of encouragement to those who need encouragement. Bear in mind that you are to show to the world the light of the glory of God.--Letter 206, July 14, 1908, a personal testimony.",
