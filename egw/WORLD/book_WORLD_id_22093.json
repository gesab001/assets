    "word": "If God cares to make these inanimate things so beautiful, that will be cut down and perish in a day, how much more careful will he be to supply the needs of his obedient children, whose lives may be as enduring as eternity. How readily will he give them the adornment of his grace, the strength of wisdom, the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit. The love of God to man is incomprehensible, broad as the world, high as heaven, and as enduring as eternity.",
