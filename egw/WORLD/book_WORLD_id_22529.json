    "word": "When it comes to this, that the brethren will not restrain themselves in these things, if their minds are in some other business, they should be released from the Office, to engage in vocations where their minds and hearts are, and let their places be filled by those whose whole souls shall be devoted to the work. It requires the whole man for the place, and God will not accept the services of those at the Office who divide their interest and efforts between his work and their own speculations and worldly interests. The time has fully come for either a separation from these things, or a separation from the work of the Office.",
