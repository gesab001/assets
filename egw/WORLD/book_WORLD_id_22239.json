    "word": "Power of a Faithful Example. \n\n     8. By a godly example, those who occupy responsible positions can maintain the elevated character of the office. Not to do this is to incur guilt, to be unfaithful stewards, blameworthy before the heavenly intelligences, who are waiting to co-operate with the human agencies in order to save souls. \n                                                                           22\nChristians are to shine as lights amid the moral darkness of the world. They are to be representatives of Christ, patterns for all who come within the sphere of their influence. They are exhorted to fidelity, and to the highest attainments of piety. The Word of God is plain upon this point. \"Do all things without murmurings and disputings; that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; holding forth the Word of life.\" In our own lives we should present to the world an illustration of the holy character of the truth which we profess to believe. This has not been done by many who are connected with the office. An indolent man occupying a position of trust in our institutions will make upon many minds an impression unfavorable to the truth. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" The lights of the world are so to shine that men, by seeing their good works, may be led to glorify our Father who is in heaven. How terrible it is for any who bear his name, to give to the world, through a defective character, a distorted image of Christ! They are constantly stumbling-blocks.",
