    "word": "The motives that prompt men in responsibility to action when they are dealing with our brethren or with worldlings, must be according to the word of God, for they are acting as God's representatives. Not one of your council meetings, not one of your board meeting but was attended by angels of God, who waited to impart wisdom and to co-operate with every principle sustained by the law of Jehovah. In his books the Lord traced every motion made in these meetings, which his eye could discern as clearly as though there were no other interest in the world. He weighs every motive, every action. He has been grieved that his character has been misrepresented. A plan of working not at all according to Christ's plan has been followed. Men have been urged and induced by specious reasoning to agree to the terms of other men, and to sell their rights and publications. Men in positions of trust departed from veracity, and by their over bearing spirit and their arguments, they have prevailed over their fellow-men. Their course has been a great injury to the workers in the Office, and a still greater injury to themselves, because they have clouded their own discernment, and lost their spiritual eyesight. Thus the office established by sacrifice was fast becoming a cage of unclean birds. It was not an increase of light that was needed to cure these spiritual maladies; for the wrong doers chose darkness rather than the light that discovers darkness. God did not acknowledge these wrong-doers as workers together with him. \n                                                                           1670",
