And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen\" [Revelation 18:1, 2]. This is the same message that was given by the second angel--Babylon is fallen, \"because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication\" [Revelation 14:8]. What is that wine? Her false doctrines.

Many kindred errors she has spread far and wide, \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\"",
