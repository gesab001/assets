    "word": "I was shown that the feelings of the church in Battle Creek in regard to us more than one year since, would not have been as strong had it not been for the course of Bro. Abbey. The enemy wrought through him. He was far from being right. He talked, from place to place, and gave exaggerated statements. He was full of the spirit of the world, was in great spiritual darkness, and Satan made him an agent to perfect the work he had begun in Battle Creek. His influence brought about the state of things which led to our being regarded in a wrong light, and brought burdens upon us almost intolerable to be borne. His statements were, many of them, exaggerated. Some of them were false. Bro. Abbey has not understood \n                                                                           4\nhimself. He has possessed a spirit of exaltation. Money is power, and Bro. Abbey has permitted his prosperity to be a snare to him. He is not humble, and prosperity is endangering his eternal interests. His heart is lifted up with pride, and the love of the world has eclipsed the value of the heavenly inheritance. Self-interest has occupied the heart. He has not had the soul called out and interested in the unfortunate, and in the poor who are not prepared to calculate and manage to acquire means. He is, in this respect, frequently pitiless. He has, in his experience, valued men and women, and youth, according to the capabilities of their muscles. If they could work diligently early and late, they were of value in his eyes. If they failed in this direction they were considered by him about worthless. \n\n                                               -",
