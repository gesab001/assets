    "word": "Many, under different circumstances have listened to the voices of the inhabitants of other worlds. They have come to act a part in this life. They have spoken in assemblies, and opened before assemblies human histories, and have done works which it was impossible for human agencies to do. Time and again have they been the generals of armies. They have been sent forth to cleanse away pestilence. They have eaten at the humble board of families. Often they have appeared as weary travelers in need of shelter for the night. --Manuscript 39, 1898, pp. 4-8. (\"The Day of Reckoning,\" November 22, 1898.)",
