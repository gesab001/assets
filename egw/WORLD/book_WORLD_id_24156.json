    "word": "The closing words of this chapter are especially important. Jesus said, \"While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled\" (verse 12). Many of us have lost the science of soul-keeping. Christ calls us to come back, and to learn in his school how to keep the souls of those that are committed to our charge.",
