    "word": "Living and Talking Above Our Environment.-- Although there is iniquity all around us, we should not approach it. Do not talk of the iniquity and wickedness that are in the world but elevate your minds and talk of your Saviour. When you see iniquity all around you, it makes you all the more glad that He is your Saviour and we are His children.--MS 7, 1888.",
