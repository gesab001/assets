    "word": "The Bible clearly reveals to us the shortness of time, and those who have genuine faith in the third angel's message will show their faith by their works. They will endeavor to keep their children \n285\nseparate from worldly influences, and to give them such instruction and training as will enable them to form characters that God can approve. The meekness and simplicity of Christ are the very first lessons to be interwoven with the children's life. They should be taught to imitate the Saviour's example of self-denial and sacrifice. The reason why these precious lessons are not given to the children is that parents themselves have not learned them. They do not bring Christ into their religious experience. They are controlled by worldly principles. Custom and fashion are followed far more closely than are the teachings of Christ.",
