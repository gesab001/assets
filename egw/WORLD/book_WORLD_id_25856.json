There were a goodly number present. The Lord gave me freedom in speaking on the soon coming of our Saviour, and the preparation we must make in order to meet our record with joy and not with grief. Each one has a work to do for himself. \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God\" (Romans 12:1, 2).",
