    "word": "How precious are these words! \"Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.\" Christ wills that we should behold his glory. Where?--In the kingdom of heaven. He wills that we should be one with him. What a thought! How willing it makes me to make any and every sacrifice for his sake! He is my love, my righteousness, my comfort, my crown of rejoicing, and he wills that we should behold his glory. If we follow him in his humiliation, in his self-sacrifice, in trial and test, we shall behold him as he is, we shall see his glory; and if we see his glory, we shall be made partakers of it.",
