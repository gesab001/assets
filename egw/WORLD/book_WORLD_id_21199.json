    "word": "It is because we do not know God, do not have faith in Christ, that we are not more deeply impressed with the humiliation he endured in our behalf, that his abasement does not lead every soul to the humbling of self, to the exalting of Jesus. The Lord calls upon you to humble yourselves under his mighty hand, that you may be partakers of his holiness. You are not to be above your Master, but as he was, so are you to be in the world. O, if you loved him as he has loved you, you would not shrink from a knowledge of the dark chapters of the experience of the Son of God.",
