    "word": "How did the world's Redeemer walk?--Not in a way to please Himself simply, but to glorify God by working the works of God in uplifting fallen man who had been made in the image of God. By precept and example, He taught men the way of righteousness, representing the character of God, and giving to the world a perfect standard of moral excellency in humanity. The two grand precepts of the law are to regulate the conduct of all humanity. This was the lesson that Jesus taught by both precept and example. He said to the people, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and . . . thy neighbour as thyself.\" The Lord God of heaven requires of human intelligences supreme love and worship.",
