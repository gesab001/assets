    "word": "Controversy Is Unprofitable.--We are not called upon to enter into controversy with those who hold false theories. Controversy is unprofitable. Christ never entered \n\n500 \n\ninto it. \"It is written\" is the weapon used by the world's Redeemer. Let us keep close to the Word. Let us allow the Lord Jesus and His messengers to testify. We know that their testimony is true.--LS 93 (1915).",
