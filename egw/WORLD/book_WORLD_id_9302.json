    "word": "God might have sent His Son into the world to condemn the world. But amazing grace! Christ came to save, not to destroy. The apostles never touched this theme without their hearts glowing with the inspiration of the matchless love of the Saviour. The apostle John cannot find words to express his feelings. He exclaims, \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed \n\n250 \n\nupon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not\" (1 John 3:1). How much the Father loved us we can never compute. There is no standard with which to compare it.--Lt 27, 1901.",
