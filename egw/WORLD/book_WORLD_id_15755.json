    "word": "The poor man who has faith and confidence in God, who trusts in His love and care, and who abounds in good works, judiciously using the little he has in blessing others with his means, is rich toward God. He feels that his neighbor has claims upon him that he cannot disregard and yet obey the commandment of God: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" The poor who are rich toward God consider the salvation of their fellow men of greater importance than all the gold and silver that the world contains.",
