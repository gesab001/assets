    "word": "The Sabbath Service \n\n     Sabbath, March 7, was a day of deep solemnity. In the forenoon Elder Haskell spoke on the world-wide proclamation of the gospel. As in the apostolic age the gospel was proclaimed in its purity, with a power which carried it into all the world, so in the last days God is to bring out every ray of light in the everlasting gospel, and send it with the power of His Spirit into all the earth.",
