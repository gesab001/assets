    "word": "You may have ears, and not hear. You may have eyes, and not see the light, nor receive the illumination that God has provided for you. You may close the door to light as effectually as the Pharisees closed the door to Christ when He taught among them. They would not receive the light and knowledge He brought, because it did not come in the way they had expected it to come. Christ was the Light of the world, and if they had received the light He graciously brought to them, it would have resulted in their salvation, but they rejected the Holy One of Israel.",
