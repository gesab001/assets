    "word": "The Lord will work with the people who will honor Him. A power from God will go with the physician who is a physician not merely to heal the maladies of the body, but who seeks to heal the disorders of the soul. Physicians, nurses, and helpers are to work in harmony. The truth is to be lived out by everyone who has any connection with the work. All the light of the past, which shineth unto the present and stretcheth forth into the future, as revealed in the Word of God, is for every soul who comes to these institutions. The Lord designs that the sanitariums established among Seventh-day Adventists shall be symbols of what can be done for the world, types of the saving power of the truth of the gospel.",
