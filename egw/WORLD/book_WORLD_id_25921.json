    "word": "The faculty of speech is a precious gift, and if the noblest of our faculties, reason, is set to the task of knowing God, then the gift of speech may become a means of grace to others, a channel through which the knowledge of God may be communicated. But if we do not feel the need of knowledge, we do not obtain it, and cannot impart that which we do not possess. Christ came to our world to assume human nature, to come in connection with man. He used the gift of speech in making known the character of God. He came to speak the words that the Father had given Him. Jesus was the greatest Teacher our world ever knew. His language was simple, clear, and plain. He longed to communicate many things to His disciples that He did not communicate to them because He knew that they could not comprehend them. He said, \"I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\"",
