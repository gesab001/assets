    "word": "Sinners must be labored for perseveringly, earnestly, wisely, until they shall see that they are transgressors of God\u2019s law, and shall exercise repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. When they are conscious of their helpless condition, and feel their need of a Savior, they may come with faith and hope to \u201cthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d Christ will accept the soul who comes to Him in true repentance. A broken and a contrite heart He will not despise.",
