    "word": "Chap. 26 - Burden Bearers in the Church\n\n     Dear Brother and Sister N: June 12, 1868, I was shown some things in reference to you. You have a work to do but see it not; you have not been burden bearers. You should feel greater interest in the work and cause of God than you do. You are so blinded by the love of the world that you do not see how great an influence the world has over you. You do not feel that a special weight of responsibility rests upon you, nor do you realize the importance of the time and the work to be accomplished. You are like persons asleep. Unity is strength. There is great feebleness in the church because there are in it so many backward ones who take no burdens. You are not workers with Christ. The spirit of the world is shutting from your hearts impressions which the truth should make.",
