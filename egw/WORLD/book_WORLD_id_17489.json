    "word": "Some have so long sacrificed principle that they cannot see the difference between the sacred and the common. Those who refuse to give heed to the Lord's instruction will go steadily downward in the path of ruin. The day of test and trial is just before us. Let every man put on his true colors. Do you choose loyalty or rebellion? Show your colors to men and an angels. We are safe only when we are committed to the right. Then the world knows where we shall be found in the day of trial and trouble.",
