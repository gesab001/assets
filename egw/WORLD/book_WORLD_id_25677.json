    "word": "Cannot men see that to belittle the law of God is to reproach Christ? Why did He come to this world to suffer and die if the law is not binding on men and women? Who could have spoken more plainly than He did regarding the immutability of the law? He came to bring light and immortality to light by exalting the law and making it honorable. Where can be found those who preach the binding claims of God's law more plainly and decidedly than did Christ when He was upon the earth?",
