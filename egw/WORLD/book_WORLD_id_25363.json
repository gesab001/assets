    "word": "Brother and Sister Haskell have been working. God has worked with them. They have not had an easy time, by any means. Sister Haskell has stood by the side of her husband as a faithful worker together with him. She has watched lest her husband become worn out with constant anxiety and labor, and when this became apparent, she has added his labors and appointments to her labor, for she was stronger than he was. These two faithful servants worked with us in Australia, and they are now working in New York City by the appointment of God; and their mission place is not the most lovely and quiet place in the world. The workers connected with them are receiving an experience, growing in knowledge and grace.",
