    "word": "God always has been. He is the great I AM. The psalmist declares, \"Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.\" He is the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity. \"I am the Lord, I change not,\" He declares. With Him there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. He is \"the same yesterday, and today, and forever.\" He is infinite and omnipresent. No words of ours can describe His greatness and majesty. \n                                                                           93",
