    "word": "MR No. 727 - Service of Joyful Obedience\n\n     The light that shineth in the face of Christ is reflected by all His followers. Hence the family resemblance in all His children. The image of Christ appears in the character of His followers, because they are partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Even on earth we may have spiritual joy as a wellspring never failing, because [it is] fed by the streams that flow from the throne of God. This is the source of all true excellence of character.",
