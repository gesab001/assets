    "word": "Where are those who would be wise laborers together with God? The apostle says, \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" But will men trust that they may be able under pressure of circumstances to step into some important position, when they have neglected to train and discipline themselves for the work? Will they imagine that they may be polished instruments in the hands of God for the salvation of souls for whom Christ died, when they have neglected to use the opportunities placed at their command for obtaining a fitness for the work? \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.\" Every one needs to improve his God-given faculties and opportunities, that individually we may be laborers together with God.",
