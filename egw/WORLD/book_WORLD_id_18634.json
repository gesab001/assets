    "word": "It is the Spirit of God that quickens the lifeless faculties of the soul to appreciate heavenly things, and attracts the affections toward God and the truth. Without the presence of Jesus in the heart, religious service is only dead, cold formalism. The longing desire for communion with God soon ceases when the Spirit of God is grieved from us, but when Christ is in us the hope of glory, we are constantly directed to think and act in reference to the glory of God. The questions will arise, \"Will this do honor to Jesus? Will this be approved of by Him? Shall I be able to maintain my integrity if I enter into this arrangement?\" God will be made the counselor of the soul, and we shall be led into safe paths, and the will of God will be made the supreme guide of our lives. This is heavenly wisdom, . . . and it makes the Christian, however humble, the light of the world.",
