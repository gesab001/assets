    "word": "Let all seek in the home, in the schoolroom, on the playground, to be laborers together with God. The highest education possible is to excel in right doing. All should strive together to make the school a success. Let old and young be diligent. Let all, teachers, and students, do their best to make the home and the school a sanctified whole. Let us strive so to conduct our schools that they may meet the requirements of Jesus Christ, who gave His precious life as a gift to the world. Let teachers and students guard themselves in word and action and in spirit. Let it be seen that all who compose the school are seeking to the utmost of their ability to improve, as mortals who appreciate what Jesus Christ has done in their behalf. He has cleared the way that through His grace there may be victory.",
