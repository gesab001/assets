    "word": "We want to keep close to the truth that is for our times--present truth. We want to know what is the truth now. We claim to believe the third angel's message; we claim that the angel was flying through the midst of heaven proclaiming the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This was the proclamation. Did you hear his voice? Did he speak so you could hear that message? Did the world hear it? Did the world hear any note? Did they want to hear? Will anyone hear it? Yes, those who have been walking out step by step as Jesus leads the way, and when the position of Christ changed from the holy to the most holy place in the Sanctuary, it is by faith to enter with Him, understand His work, and then to present to the world the last message of mercy that is to be given to the world. And what \n\n\n                                     -67- \n\nis it? It is a message to prepare a people for the second coming of the Son of Man. It is God's great day of preparation, and therefore every minister of Jesus Christ should have in his course of action, in the burden of his labor, a zeal and living interest, and intensity in his efforts which is appropriate to the truth that is for this time, which is claimed to be the last message of mercy to our world. Well, then, we cannot sleep, we cannot be indifferent; we must labor for the precious souls around us, of men and women; we must work with all our might, for the Lord is coming.",
