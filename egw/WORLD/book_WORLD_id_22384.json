    "word": "Men not connected with God, not sanctified in heart and life, have a theory of the truth, as had the Jewish chief priests and elders in Christ's day. On one occasion Christ said of the men who made the study of the Old Testament their business, \"Ye know not the Scriptures nor the power of God.\" The world generally will receive the ministry of the word, and admit the truth if it is not proclaimed in the demonstration of the Spirit and of the power of God. The natural heart finds no opposition to such teaching. It is only the spirit and savor of Christ that is hateful to the unrenewed heart. The form of godliness is not opposed by the world. The popular ministry they will not reject. There is nothing in it that calls the sinner to a sense of his guilt, calls him to repentance. It is nothing less than the quick and powerful word of God, working in the hearts of his messengers to give the knowledge of the glory of God, that can give the victory. The truth brought before the people, which can save the soul, must not only come from God, but his Spirit must be the active agent in \n                                                                           11\ncommunication; else it will be only as the sayings and doings of men. These may have the form of Christianity as far as the letter is concerned, and when the crisis shall come that is now very near, these men will be unable to stand. When persecution and reproach come because of the truth, these men will find another platform. The opposition and persecution will not be slow to take their stand when God's people have the living testimony among them, and speak the words of truth, being imbued with power from on high.",
