    "word": "Carry the Truth to the Inhabitants of Our Land--There is a world to be saved, and this is why I am so anxious that we, as believers in the Lord Jesus, shall live on the plan of addition, adding grace to grace, and becoming established in the most holy faith. Those who are diligent to make their own calling and election sure, are also seeking in every way possible to win many souls to the truth for this time. We need more earnestness, more consecrated zeal. We have a knowledge of the most sacred truths ever committed to mortals, and these truths we must present to the world. We do not half believe these truths. If we did, there would be seen more praying, and more diligence in trying to carry these truths to the inhabitants of the cities of our land. God is now calling upon us to open up a strong work in the cities.--Ms. 23, 1910, p. 5. (\"A Promise of Life Eternal,\" Jan. 29, 1910.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. August 21, 1980",
