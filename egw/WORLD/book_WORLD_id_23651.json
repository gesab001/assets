    "word": "The situation in all the large cities must be studied, that the truth may be given to all the people. In these large cities the Lord has many honest souls, who are becoming confused by the strange developments in the religious world. There are many who have been waiting to hear the \"certain sound\" of the message that would meet the emergency. All over our land the Lord has honest souls, who are standing in uncertainty. The words were spoken: \"Repeat the messages in their order. Tell My people to proclaim the message, the binding-off message, that is to proclaim a people for the coming of the King. Give the world a knowledge of the messages of the first, second and third angels. Bind up the law among My disciples. There are many who will listen because men will speak under the influence of the Holy Spirit. You are twenty years behind; but let the warning voice now be heard speaking with the voice of assurance.\"",
