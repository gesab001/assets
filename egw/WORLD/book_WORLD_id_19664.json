    "word": "There is a counterfeit Christianity in the world as well as a genuine Christianity. The true spirit of the man is manifested by the way in which he deals with his fellow man. We can ask the question, \"Does he represent the character of Christ in spirit and action, or simply manifest the natural selfish traits of character that belong to the people of this world?\" Profession weighs nothing with God. Before it is everlastingly too late for wrongs to be righted, let each one ask himself, \"What am I?\" It depends upon ourselves as to whether we shall form such characters as will constitute us one of God's royal family above.",
