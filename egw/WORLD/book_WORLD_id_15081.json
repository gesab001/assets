    "word": "Promises to the Overcomer.--The world should be no criterion for us. It is fashionable to indulge the appetite in luxurious food and unnatural stimulants, thus strengthening the animal propensities and crippling the growth and development of the moral faculties.

If they do this, they will not fight as one that beateth the air.",
