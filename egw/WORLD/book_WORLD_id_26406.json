    "word": "It is not the will of God for His children to be engrossed in cares and get worldly-minded. No, no, and they will never do this if the suffering cause is ever before them. They must die to self. God is not displeased, but approbates His children getting together every Sabbath and listening to the testimonies of each other. Neither does He frown upon their going once a year or perhaps oftener to a distance to meeting. But when souls have had a feast--and a rich one--hearing from God's Word of His precious truth, then is the time for them to improve upon what they have heard. Instead of going again and again to hear more, let them ponder over and over what they hear. Many will have to render an account for privileges they have had in attending a meeting and hearing the truth they have made no improvement upon.",
