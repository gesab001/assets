    "word": "Professed Christian parents will pay the greatest deference to their worldly and irreligious guests, while these very persons are leading the children of those who pay them so much polite attention, away from sobriety and from religion.

Old and young became absorbed in questionable enjoyments, and the excitement of worldly pleasure.",
