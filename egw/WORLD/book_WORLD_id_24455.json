    "word": "Souls to Be Saved in Wicked Cities--Christ came to seek the lost pearl which was buried beneath the darkness of ignorance and perverse iniquity of the earth. He was moved with pity when He saw the condition of His purchased heritage. He saw that children and youth were becoming wise to do evil--continually acquiring greater tact and shrewdness in the service of the world through their contact with men full of selfishness, ambition and pride. He saw that as children grow up to youth, and youth to manhood and womanhood, they become full of self-sufficiency, maturing all too rapidly their knowledge of evil practices through constant association with the dishonest, with thieves, with the depraved, dissolute, disobedient elements of society. They learn to be cunning in avoiding detection, becoming experts in every phase of deception and fraud. They are educated in crime by reading the stories which fill the popular publications of the day. Having no regard for the right because it is right, as they read stories of theft, murder, and every other species of crime, they are led to devise plans by which they could improve upon the criminal's methods and escape detection. \n\n\n                                  -226- \n\nThus these foul publications assist in perfecting the education of the youth in the way that leads to perdition.",
