    "word": "Chapter XIII. - Heredity.\n\nHabits Repeated. \n     231. The physical and mental condition of parents is perpetuated in their offspring.  This is a matter that is not duly considered.  Wherever the habits of the parents are contrary to physical law, the injury done to themselves will be repeated in future generations. Satan knows this very well, and he is perpetuating his work through transmission. . . . Those who will indulge the animal passions and gratify lust will surely stamp upon their offspring the debasing practices, the grossness, of their own physical and moral defilement.  By physical, mental, and moral culture all may become co-workers with Christ. Very much depends upon the parents.  It lies with them whether they will bring into the world children who will prove a blessing or a curse.-- U. T., January, 1897.",
