    "word": "PH100 - Testimony for the Physicians and Helpers of the Sanitarium (1879)\n\n\n\tMoral and Intellectual Culture. \n\n     Oct. 9, 1878, I was shown that the Sanitarium at Battle Creek has been established by the providence of God, and that his blessing is indispensable to its success. The physicians are not quacks nor infidels, but men who are thoroughly educated, and who understand how to take care of the sick; men who fear God, and have an earnest interest for the moral and spiritual welfare of their patients. This interest for spiritual as well as physical good, the managers of the institution should make no effort to conceal. By a life of true Christian integrity they can give to the world an example worthy of imitation; and they should not hesitate to let it be seen that in addition to their skill in treating disease, they are continually gaining wisdom and knowledge from Christ, the greatest teacher the world has ever known. They must have this connection with the Source of all wisdom, to make their labor successful.",
