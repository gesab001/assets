    "word": "The judgment of men, even of teachers, may be very wide of the mark as to what constitutes true education. The teachers in the days of Christ did not educate the youth in the correct knowledge of the Scriptures, which lie at the foundation of all education worthy of the name. Christ declared to the Pharisees, \"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God,\" \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\" And He prayed for His disciples, \"Sanctify them \n                                                                           449\nthrough Thy truth: Thy word is truth. As Thou hast sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.\"",
