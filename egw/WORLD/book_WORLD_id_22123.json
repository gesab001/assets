    "word": "The whole heart must be entered and purified by the searching Spirit of God. Jesus will not abide in the soul where pride exists; and if we desire His presence, the soul temple must be cleansed of all evil occupants. If the door of the heart is open to Jesus, He will come in, and His presence will expel every unholy thought, and by faith we may hold sweet communion with God. If Jesus abides in the heart, we shall glorify Him in our lives; for the Christian is to let his light shine forth to the world in good works.",
