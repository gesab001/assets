    "word": "He who imitates Christ will show forth His self-denial and self-sacrifice. . . . Just where the conscience of the Bible Christian warns him to forbear, to deny himself, to stop, just there the worldling steps over the line to indulge his selfish propensities. On one side of the line is the self-denying follower of Jesus Christ, on the other side of the line is the self-indulgent world-lover, pandering in fashion, engaging in frivolity, and pampering himself in forbidden pleasures. On this side of the line the Christian cannot go. It is no place for him.",
