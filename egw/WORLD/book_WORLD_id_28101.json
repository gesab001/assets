    "word": "There is a power in the truth. When allowed to operate under favorable conditions, the gospel will gather a harvest of souls. Every truly converted man, firmly established in the truth, is a light bearer to the world; for Christ shines through him. He shines in a world enshrouded in moral darkness. A few truly converted souls are of infinitely more value than a large number who are unconverted, dead in trespasses and sins.",
