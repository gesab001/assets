    "word": "Suicides, Some Causes of.--The world, who act as though there were no God, absorbed in selfish pursuits, will soon experience sudden destruction, and shall not escape. Many continue in the careless gratification of self, until they become so disgusted with life that they kill themselves. Dancing and carousing, drinking and smoking, indulging their animal passions, they go as an ox to the slaughter. Satan is working with all his art and enchantments to keep men marching blindly onward, until the Lord arises out of His place to punish the inhabitants of earth for their iniquities, when the earth shall disclose her blood, and no more cover her slain. The whole world appears to be in the march to death.--Ms 139, 1903.",
