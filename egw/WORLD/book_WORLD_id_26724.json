    "word": "What honor is conferred upon men in that they may be laborers together with God, His messengers, to proclaim as did the forerunner of Christ, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Lift up the risen Saviour, and say to all who will hear, Come to Him who has loved us \n\n\n                                    -294- \n\nand died for us. Let the self-denial, the compassion, the great love wherewith Christ has loved us in purchasing us with His own life, be unfolded before men. The science of salvation is to be the burden of every sermon, the theme of every song. Let it be poured forth in every supplication.",
