    "word": "The medical missionary field is open before us. We are beginning to comprehend better the light given years ago--that health reform principles would be as an entering wedge, to be followed by a religious influence. To voice the words of John, \"Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.\" Would that all might be so taught as to work intelligently as medical missionaries; for this would serve as credentials to them in finding access to homes and families where they could sow the seeds of truth. We want to feel as Christ felt,--that we can not abandon the souls who are in need of what we can do for them; we can not leave the helpless, suffering little ones to the evils of orphanage, and ignorance, and want, and sin, and crime. The Lord would have us to be health reformers in the true sense of the term. \n     1895. \n                                                                           52",
