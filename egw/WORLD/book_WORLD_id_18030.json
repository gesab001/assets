    "word": "Our Relation to the World \n\n     We are not to copy the world's practices, and yet we are not to stand aloof from the people of the world; for our light must shine amid the moral darkness that covers the earth. There is a sad lack in the church, of Christian love one for another. This love is easily extinguished; and yet without it we cannot have Christian fellowship, nor love for those for whom Christ died.",
