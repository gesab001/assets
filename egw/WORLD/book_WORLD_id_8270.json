    "word": "No one should feel that his judgment is faultless, that his ideas are above criticism, and that he can pursue a course of his own, regardless of the opinions of others with whom he is united in labor.

It is worldwide; and we should be united, so far as possible, in the manner of presenting it to the world.",
