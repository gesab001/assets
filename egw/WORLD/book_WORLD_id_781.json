    "word": "Noah was commanded to build an ark for the saving of himself and his house. It is stated, \u201cNoah . . . have I found righteous before me in this generation.\u201d And it is also stated that \u201cNoah walked with God.\u201d Noah did not stop to question, \u201cWhat will the inhabitants of the old world think of me if I begin to build this boat upon dry land?\u201d He believed just what God had told him, and he commenced to work upon the light and plan that God had given him. He had to employ many carpenters to help him in this great work of building, and there were many of these who were believers at that time. But the largest part of the Noachic world were unbelievers, and they made a great deal of sport of Noah. They ridiculed the idea of building a great boat on dry land.",
