    "word": "Mary, the mother of Jesus, . . . asked, \"Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.\" Divine light shone through humanity as Jesus lifted His right hand and asked, \"How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them\" (verses 48-50). They did not comprehend the true meaning of His words. But, though He was the Son of God, He went down with His parents and came unto Nazareth, and was subject unto them. . . . At the age of twelve the Holy Spirit was abiding upon Jesus and He felt something of the burden of the mission for which He had come to our world.",
