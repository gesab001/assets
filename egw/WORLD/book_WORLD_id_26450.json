    "word": "This order of things has changed of late; within four years there has been a different order of things which I do not favor. Temperance has been at a low ebb. I cannot sanction this state of things in the light of the Bible and the testimonies given me of God. I know that Elder Butler has been opposed to health reform. I advocate no extremes. But as I was looking over my manuscript after leaving California I see the decided testimonies borne and the dangers of our people imitating the customs and practices of the world. My heart is sick and sad over this state of things, and I do think that the light which has been given should be gathered up and made to shine.",
