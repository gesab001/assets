    "word": "Christ left heaven that we might be redeemed from the depths of sin and degradation, and that we might have eternal riches. Our characters are photographed on the books of heaven, and from these books we are to be judged. What have we done with the talents that God has given us? Have we exerted our influence on the right side? Have we set the proper example, or have we been following the fashions of the world? Have we used our powers in God's service? Do our lives reflect light to those around us. God expects every one to make the best use of his faculties. If we fulfill the mission that has been assigned us, the results will be seen in the kingdom of God, and to us will be spoken the words, \"Well done, good and faithful servant:...enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"--Ms 29, 1886, pp. 1-4.
