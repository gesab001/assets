    "word": "Fathers and mothers, you take the responsibility of bringing children into the world. Will you consider it is not for you to work in vain? \"We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.\" . . . Now this takes in Christian experience. Here is large encouragement. Here are the graces we are to receive, if we comply with the conditions. Fathers, mothers, if you are not converted, will you measure your advantages if you will comply with the conditions? . . . Your children are the Lord's property with which you have been entrusted, to bring up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.-- Manuscript 61, Oct. 15, 1911, \"Individual Responsibility of Fathers and Mothers.\"",
