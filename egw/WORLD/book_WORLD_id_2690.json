    "word": "Our faith requires us to elevate the standard of reform, and take advance steps. The condition of our acceptance with God is a practical separation from the world. The Lord calls upon us as a people, \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate,\" \"and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.\" The world may despise you because you do not meet their standard, engage in their dissipating amusements, and follow their pernicious ways; but the God of heaven promises to receive you, and to be a Father unto you. \"Ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\" 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.",
