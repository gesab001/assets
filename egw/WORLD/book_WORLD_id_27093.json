    "word": "This warning God presents to be as especially necessary for your welfare. He loves your brethren in the faith, and He works with them to the same end that He works with you. His church on earth is to assume divine proportions before the world, as a temple built of living stones, each one reflecting light. It is to be the light of the world, as a city set on a hill, that can not be hid. It is built of stones laid close together, stone fitting to stone, making a firm, solid building. All the stones are not of the same form or shape. Some are large, some are small, but each has its own place to fill. And the value of each stone is determined by the light that it reflects. This is God's plan. He desires all who are engaged in His work to fill their appointed places in the great work for this time.",
