    "word": "What can the most learned in book lore know aright without a knowledge of the Word of God? Without the education found in the Bible, how shall we reach the next world, where we shall enter the presence of God and see His face? Nothing of this world's wisdom, the knowledge gained from books, presents a true and sure foundation upon which we can build for eternity.--Manuscript 15, 1898, pp. 1-5. (\"The Fear of the Lord Is the Beginning of Wisdom,\" undated.)",
