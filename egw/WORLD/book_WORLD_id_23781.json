    "word": "God spoke, and his words created his works in the natural world. God's creation is but a reservoir of means made ready for him to employ instantly to do his pleasure. Nothing is useless, but the curse has caused tares to be sown by the enemy. Shall rational beings alone cause confusion in our world? Shall we not live to God? Shall we not honor him? Our God and Saviour is all-wise, all-sufficient. He came to our world that his perfection might be revealed in us.--Letter 131, 1897, p. 3. (To Sister Wessels, June 24, 1897.)",
