    "word": "We cannot, my brethren and sisters, float along with the current of the world. The work for us to do is to come out and be separate. This is the only way we can walk with God as did Enoch. . . . Like Enoch we are called upon to have a strong, living, working faith; it is the only way we can be laborers together with God.

We must know what moral changes are essential to be made in our characters through the grace of Christ in order to be fitted for the mansions above.\u2014Letter 53, 1887.",
