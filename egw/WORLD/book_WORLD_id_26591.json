    "word": "The word was spoken to me, \"Speak to the people all the words that I shall give thee. Wake up the mighty men. Let them become fully aroused, that they may with pen and voice stir up the people to whom God has given great light, that they may let their light shine forth in clear, steady rays to the world. A world is to be warned; and when the third angel's message goes forth with a loud cry, minds will be fully prepared to make decisions for or against the truth.",
