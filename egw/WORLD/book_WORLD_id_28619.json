    "word": "Avoid Peculiar Ideas \n\n     We are not to try to gather together strange, peculiar ideas, which are not revealed in the Word of God. If the shepherds of the flock of God are partakers of the divine nature, they will be clothed with genuine humility. They will fill contentedly the place God gives them, shining brightly amidst the moral darkness. Realizing the sacredness of the truth, they will refuse to be drawn out of their place by the attractions of the world or the praise of men. They will stand firmly at their post of duty as brave soldiers.",
