    "word": "We are now amid the perils of the last days, and something more is essential for you to have than that which you now have. It is hard for you to unlearn things which you have learned, and learn those things which ought to have been the very alpha of your education. The omega you will never reach in this world. Seek the Lord while He may be found. Be sure that you have learned your lessons in wearing the yoke of Christ. Then, learning under His restraining discipline His meekness, His lowliness of heart, you will find rest unto your souls. You will find yourselves riveted to the eternal Rock.",
