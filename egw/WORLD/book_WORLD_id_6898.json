    "word": "The Lord has made every provision whereby man may have full and free salvation, and be complete in \n86\nHim. God designs that His children shall have the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, that all may have the light of truth. God has provided salvation for the world at infinite cost, even through the gift of His only-begotten Son. The apostle asks, \u201cHe that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\u201d (Romans 8:32). Then if we are not saved, the fault will not be on the part of God, but on our part, that we have failed to cooperate with the divine agencies. Our will has not coincided with God\u2019s will.\u2014RH November 1, 1892 quoted in 1SM 375.",
