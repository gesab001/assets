    "word": "From the crest of Olivet, Jesus looked upon Jerusalem. Fair and peaceful was the scene spread out before him. It was the season of the Passover, and from all lands the children of Jacob had gathered there to celebrate the great national festival. In the midst of gardens and vineyards, and green slopes studded with pilgrims\u2019 tents, rose the terraced hills, the stately palaces, and massive bulwarks of Israel's capital. The daughter of Zion seemed in her pride to say, \u201cI sit a queen, and shall see no sorrow;\u201d as lovely then, and deeming herself as secure in Heaven's favor, as when, ages before, the royal minstrel sung, \u201cBeautiful of situation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion,\u201d \u201cthe city of the great King.\u201d [Psalm 48:2.] In full view were the magnificent buildings of the temple. The rays of the setting sun lighted up the snowy \n18\nwhiteness of its marble walls, and gleamed from golden gate and tower and pinnacle. \u201cThe perfection of beauty\u201d it stood, the pride of the Jewish nation. What child of Israel could gaze upon the scene without a thrill of joy and admiration! But far other thoughts occupied the mind of Jesus. \u201cWhen he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it.\u201d [Luke 19:41.] Amid the universal rejoicing of the triumphal entry, while palm branches waved, while glad hosannas awoke the echoes of the hills, and thousands of voices declared him king, the world's Redeemer was overwhelmed with a sudden and mysterious sorrow. He, the Son of God, the Promised One of Israel, whose power had conquered death, and called its captives from the grave, was in tears, not of ordinary grief, but of intense, irrepressible agony.",
