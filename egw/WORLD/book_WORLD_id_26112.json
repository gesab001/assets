    "word": "When men talk of the improvements that are made in higher education, they are aping the inhabitants of the Noatic world. They are yielding to the temptation of Satan to eat of the tree of knowledge, of which God has said, \"Ye shall not eat of it, lest ye die.\" God gave men a trial, and the result was the destruction of the world by a flood. In this age of the world's history there are teachers and students who suppose that their advancement in knowledge supersedes the knowledge of God, and their cry is, \"Higher education.\" They consider that they have greater knowledge that the greatest Teacher the world has ever known.",
