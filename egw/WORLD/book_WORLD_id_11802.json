    "word": "The world was arrayed against God's justice and His laws, and Noah was regarded as fanatic. Satan, when tempting Eve to disobey God, said to her, \"Ye shall not surely die.\" Great men, worldly, honored, and wise men, repeated the same story, \"Ye shall not surely die.\" \"The threatenings of God,\" they said, \"are for the purpose of intimidating, and will never be verified. You need not be alarmed. Such an event as the destruction of the world by the God who made it, and the punishment of the beings He has created, will never take place.\" . . . So the people did not humble their hearts before God, but continued their disobedience and wickedness, the same as though God had not spoken to them through His servant.",
