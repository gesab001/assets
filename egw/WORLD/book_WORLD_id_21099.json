    "word": "\"Ye are the light of the world,\" Christ declares. \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" God's work in the earth in these last days is to reflect the light that Christ brought into the world. This light is to dissipate the gross darkness of ages. Men and women in heathen darkness are to be reached by those who at one time were in a similar condition of ignorance, but who have received the knowledge of the truth of God's word. These heathen nations will accept eagerly the instruction given them in a knowledge of God.",
