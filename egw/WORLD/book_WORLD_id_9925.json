    "word": "And Christ has been made our judge. The Father is not the judge. The angels are not. He who took humanity upon Himself, and in this world lived a perfect life, is to judge us. He only can be our judge. . . . No one of you has been appointed to be judge of others. It is all that you can do to discipline yourselves. . . .",
