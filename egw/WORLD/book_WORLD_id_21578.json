    "word": "I have been shown several times of your danger and of your living far behind when you should be far in advance of what you now are. The responsibilities which encircle you are not appreciated and are not met; and in my dreams I am writing you the past testimonies that have been given me for you in the State of New York. God has given to you great light and precious opportunities for knowing his will and doing good. This neglect affects the person himself as well as others connected with him. It is not a praise-worthy act to decline responsibility, but it is a great dishonor to your Maker who has entrusted you with talents of means and of influence, which will constitute you channels of light to the world if you are faithful to your trust. All your powers given you of God are to be used. All the means which he has lent you is to be put to wise improvement, because you are not your own, you are bought with a price, and are trading upon entrusted capital. God requires you to put to improvement every gift lent you in trust. You are not to be far-reaching merely to get gain to yourself, to give you the power to do that which the world's Redeemer has told you not to do: Lay not up for yourselves treasures \n                                                                           4\nupon the earth, for your heart will be upon your earthly treasures; but lay up for yourselves treasures in the heavens, in bags which wax not old.",
