    "word": "Misinterpretation of Responsibility \n     Self-esteem and self-exaltation are prevailing evils, and because of this there is manifest a spirit of criticism, where no such thing should exist. And some who realize the responsibilities resting upon them, and who would go forth with the message of warning, are prevented by the forbiddings of those who feel that it is their prerogative to control the actions of their fellow-workers. Thus Satan is working to close the lips of some to whom God has given His message to the world; and if possible he will continue his working until souls who are convinced of the truth for this time, seeing the inconsistencies of those who profess to believe it, turn away and are lost. . . .",
