    "word": "You need, my brother, to place burdens and responsibilities upon others, while you preside. You can be worked by the Holy Spirit to devise and plan after the order of God. But trust not to your own human wisdom. Trust not to poisonous drugs that will interfere with nature's work and leave their cruel trail behind. Work away from drugs, and never, never advise one under your influence to go to Ann Arbor or any other place to obtain the education supposed to be essential for the perfection of the medical practitioner. The stamp left upon them by such places is almost ineffaceable. Educate, educate, educate, by placing yourself and others in the closest connection with the greatest Healer the world has ever known. Keep in view the better world, which is attracting to itself all \n\n\n                                     -42- \n\nwho are receiving the grace of God in this world.",
