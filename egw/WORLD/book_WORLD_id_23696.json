    "word": "I do not demerit Bible Readings. It is a book which will do a great amount of good, but it can never take the place that the Lord designed that volume 4 should have in the world and among our people. I have spread before them the light given me of Heaven in that book. In conversation with Frank [Belden] he was constantly referring to Thoughts on Daniel and Revelation--that no more had been done for that than for volume 4. I consider that that book should go everywhere.",
