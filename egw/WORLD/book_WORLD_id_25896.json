    "word": "My soul is still burdened with the importance of circulating this book. A grievous wrong has been done. Although nothing special has been openly spoken against Volume IV of the Spirit of Prophecy, this book has to a great degree been displaced by another book, which has kept from the world the light God has given. Volume IV was dropped, and the book entitled Bible Readings was \n\n\n                                    -240- \n\nrecommended by those in charge of the circulation of our literature. Bible Readings has been constantly kept before the minds of our people, by illustrations and notices in our papers and by commendations in public gatherings. Every incident that could be used in favor of Bible Readings has been presented to our people.",
