    "word": "Matter, Created When World Was Made.--It is not depth of reasoning that is to be productive of the most good; the world by human wisdom knew not God, but holy men spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. No amount of reasoning or explanation can tell the whys and wherefores of the creation of the world. It is to be understood by faith in the great creative power. By faith we must believe in the mighty working creative power of God through Jesus Christ. \"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear\" (are not present to the eye). This is a matter that can be stated, but mere reasoning will never convince one of the truth of the statement.--Letter 56, 1903.",
