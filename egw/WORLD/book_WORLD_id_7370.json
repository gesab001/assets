    "word": "God thus forms the believers in His Word in one body, that their influence may be a blessing to one another and to the world. Each member converted reveals a transformation of character, and he is strengthened and sustained by the courage and faith of the whole. The weakest saint, if he believes in Christ, is a member of Christ's body; and if he lives in humble dependence upon God, he will become strong; for he has a right to all the privileges of a child of God.",
