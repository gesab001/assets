    "word": "Our health institutions are established to present the living principles of a clean, pure, healthful diet. Knowledge must be imparted in regard to self-denial, self-control. Jesus who made man, who redeemed man, is to be held up before all who shall come to our institutions. The knowledge of the way of life, peace, health, and sanctification of the soul and body, must be given line upon line, precept upon precept, that men and women may see the need of reform. They must be led to renounce the debasing customs and practices which existed in Sodom and in the antediluvian world, whom God destroyed because of their iniquity. Said Christ, \"But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered the Ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\"",
