    "word": "Godliness in Harmony With Laws of Health.--Those who walk in the path of wisdom and holiness find that \"godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come\" (1 Timothy 4:8). They are alive to the enjoyment of life's real pleasures and are not troubled with vain regrets over misspent hours nor with gloomy forebodings, as the worldling too often is when not diverted by some exciting amusement. Godliness does not conflict with the laws of health but is in harmony with them. The fear of the Lord is the foundation of all real prosperity.--CTBH 14, 1890. (CH 29.)",
