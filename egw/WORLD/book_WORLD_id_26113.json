    "word": "Christ came to the earth as the Light of the world. Nearly two thousand years ago a voice was heard in heaven--the more mysterious because it came from the throne of the Infinite--saying: \"Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not, but a body hast Thou prepared Me: Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) I delight to do Thy will, O my God; yea, Thy law is within My heart.\" [See Psalms 40:6-8; Hebrews 10:5-9.]",
