    "word": "In your letter you speak of the rescue work in the poorer parts of the city. I am glad that you feel a burden to help the very ones who need help. \n\n\n                                    -330- \n\nChrist desires His work to become the light of the world. He Himself came to make known to all classes the gospel of salvation. But it is not your special duty to make great efforts among the worst classes of society. There may be associated with you some who should work among the unfortunate and the degraded, but you are especially fitted to labor for the higher classes. Your influence with them would be lessened should you be associated largely with the rescue work for those who are generally regarded as outcasts.--Letter 158, 1909, pp. 4, 5. (To Dr. D. H. Kress, November 18, 1909.) \n\nReleased April 28, 1976.",
