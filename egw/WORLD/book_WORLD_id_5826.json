    "word": "The Joy of the Lord\n     As their reward the faithful under-shepherds will hear from the Chief Shepherd, \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant.\u201d He will then place the crown of glory upon their heads, and bid them enter into the joy of their Lord. What is that joy?\u2014It is beholding with Christ the redeemed \n281\nsaints, reviewing with him their travail for souls, their self-denial and self-sacrifice, their giving up of ease, of worldly gain, and every earthly inducement, and choosing the reproach, the suffering, the self-abasement, the wearing labor, and the anguish of spirit as men would oppose the counsel of God against their own souls; it is calling to remembrance the chastening of their souls before God, their weeping between the porch and the altar, and their becoming a spectacle unto the world, to angels, and to men. All this is then ended, and the fruits of their labors are seen, souls are saved through their efforts in Christ. The ministers who have been co-workers with Christ, enter into the joy of their Lord, and are satisfied.\u2014Vol. 2, p. 709.",
