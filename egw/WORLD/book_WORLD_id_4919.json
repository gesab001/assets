    "word": "At this time the righteous reign as kings and priests unto God. John in the Revelation says: \"I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.\" Revelation 20:4. . . . It is at this time that, as foretold by Paul, \"the saints shall judge the world.\" 1 Corinthians 6:2, 3. In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according to the deeds done in the body. Then the portion which the wicked must suffer is meted out, according to their works; and it is recorded against their names in the book of death.",
