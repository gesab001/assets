    "word": "Pure religion and undefiled before the Father is this: \"To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\" Good deeds are the fruit that Christ requires us to bear: kind words, deeds of benevolence, of tender regard for the poor, the needy, the afflicted. When hearts sympathize with hearts burdened with discouragement and grief, when the hand dispenses to the needy, when the naked are clothed, the stranger made welcome to a seat in your parlor and a place in your heart, angels are coming very near, and an answering strain is responded to in heaven.--Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 25.",
