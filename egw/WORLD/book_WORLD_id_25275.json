    "word": "Christ devoted Himself to the salvation of the human race, and man should never, never, lift up his heart unto vanity. You who are possessed of worldly treasure are to become poor by following your Redeemer's example, devoting your substance to the advancement of the cause of God, and not to self-indulgence. Those who acquire wealth for the purpose of hoarding it, leave the curse of wealth to their children. It is a sin, an awful, soul-periling sin, for fathers and mothers to do this, and this sin extends to their posterity. Often the children spend their means in foolish extravagance, in riotous living, so that they become beggars. They know not the value of the inheritance they have squandered. Had their fathers and mothers set them a proper example, not in hoarding but in imparting their wealth, they would have laid up for themselves treasure in heaven, and received a return, even in this world, of peace and happiness, and in the future life eternal riches.",
