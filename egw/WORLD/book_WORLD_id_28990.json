    "word": "Every line of work now to be done in the South is to be carefully and studiously\n125\ncarried forward from point to point. The workers are to make the most of the opportunities that come to them to become acquainted with the leading men in the world. They are to set an example that will magnify and honor the truth. Every church is to work in a way that will reveal Christ. There is to be no coldness and indifference in the work. Sanitariums and schools for the white people and for the colored people are to be established. In the providence of God, we have a most beautiful location for our colored school in Huntsville. And the school is to be provided with buildings and facilities that will compare favorably with the location. The good work being done there for colored students is to receive encouragement. After the school term is over, the students are not to be left without employment, to seek for it among worldlings. A great deal is lost when this is done.",
