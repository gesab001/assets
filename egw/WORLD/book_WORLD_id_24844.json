    "word": "In the book of Revelation we read of a special work that God would have His agents do in these last days. They have a special warning to give to the world. All the institutions that have been established in His providence are to lift up the standard of the third angel's message. God has blessed these institutions, and given them prosperity as His chosen agents have acted as co-workers with Jesus Christ, and have communicated the wisdom which He imparted. God has given prosperity to the Sanitarium, and to Dr. Kellogg as God's instrumentality. Your prosperity, Dr. Kellogg, has been in proportion to the efforts you have made to make the truth stand forth in its \n\n\n                                     -60- \n\npurity. Your medical practice has been attended with success because of His blessing, and if you will acknowledge Him in all your ways, He will direct you into paths of complete victory. The earnest zeal which has been manifested by Seventh-day Adventists under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, has been acknowledged of God. The Health Institution has not been brought into favor simply because of the talent, skill, or wisdom of one man. It is because God has had faithful instrumentalities that have consented to be worked by the Holy Spirit, and many influences have been combined in bringing about the prosperity of the Sanitarium. The time that has been spent in communing with God, in seeking His help before undertaking to relieve those who were in a critical condition, has brought angels to the side of the doctor and his assistants. In transacting your business that has been so important, you have succeeded, according as you have trusted in God. He has been by your side just as verily as Christ was by the side of those who were suffering when He walked among them on earth.",
