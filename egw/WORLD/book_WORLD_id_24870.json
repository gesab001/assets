    "word": "The message of mercy that was brought from the Father was meant for the ears of the whole world. Christ came to unveil the character of God. He did not select a part of the human race and place a limited value on them. His grace is for all, and the estimate He places on the human soul is infinite. His power also is unlimited by right of His position with the Father. Had it not been for the great sacrifice He made in giving His life for mankind, the human race would have perished in their sin. But after the fall of Satan and man, Christ stepped in to give us another trial. He alone could give man another opportunity to recover himself, for only He who was equal with God could carry out the great scheme of redemption. When Christ has given such an example of comprehensive love, should an exclusive spirit be cherished by those who profess His name? Christ says, \"I am the light of the world.\" He is the great fountain of life and salvation.",
