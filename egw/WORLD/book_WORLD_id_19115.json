    "word": "In the eyes of the world, those who serve God may appear weak. They may be apparently sinking beneath the billows, but with the next billow they are seen rising nearer to their haven. \"I give unto them eternal life,\" saith our Lord; \". . . neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand\" (John 10:28). Though kings shall be cast down, and nations removed, the souls that through faith link themselves with God's purposes shall abide forever. \"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever\" (Daniel 12:3).--Manuscript 36, Dec. 9, 1896, \"Obedience the Condition of Success.\"",
