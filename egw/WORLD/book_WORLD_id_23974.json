    "word": "I want that our brethren should feel the importance of praying more, and loving our brethren more. The love that is expressed, is revealed. It speaks with a voice that nothing can silence. For God sent His Son into the world because He loved the world. There may be a sharpness with some, another defect with another. But those who advocate the truth can afford to be fair and pleasant. It does not need the human mixing in. It is not for you to use the Holy Spirit of God, but it is for the Holy Spirit to use you.",
