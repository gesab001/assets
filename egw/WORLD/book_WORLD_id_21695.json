    "word": "Promises to the Young \n\n     The youth who follow Christ have a warfare before them; they have a daily cross to bear in coming out of the world and imitating the life of Christ. But there are many precious promises on record for those who seek the Saviour early. Wisdom calls to the sons of men, \"I love them that love Me; and those that seek Me early shall find Me.\" They will find that \"the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\"",
