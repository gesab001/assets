    "word": "Faith, obedience, and love are to be developed in the character, equal to the light and grace given. If there is not an increase of faith, there will be a decrease of light and blessings. Light is shining, and if we follow the light our experience will grow brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. All who walk in the truth will be renewed in knowledge and true holiness, and will be obtaining daily victories over self, pride, and the love of the world.",
