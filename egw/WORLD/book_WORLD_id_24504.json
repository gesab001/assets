    "word": "The true beauty of the soul is found in obedience to the will of God. Adam and Eve's disobedience in a very small matter lost Eden to them. God's commands are for the regulation of the human heart. If we observe them, our lives will be lives of obedience because we love Jesus. \"Ye are My friends,\" He said, \"if ye do whatsoever I command you\" (John 15:14). Enoch was a friend of God, and he walked with God. Christ's followers will esteem every precept He has given them to be right. They have the guarantee, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" (Matthew 28:20).--Ms 138, 1897, pp. 2,3,9,10.
