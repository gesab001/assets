    "word": "Jesus . . . says, \"I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth\" (John 17:19). \"Thy word is truth.\" We need, then, to become familiar with the Word of God, to study and to practice it in life. . . . We deny Jesus Christ as the One who taketh away the sins of the world if we do not, after accepting the truth, reveal to the world the sanctifying effects of the truth on our own characters. If we are not better men and women, if we are not more kindhearted, more pitiful, more courteous, more full of tenderness and love, if we do not manifest to others the love that led Jesus to the world on His mission of mercy, we are not witnesses to the world of the power of Jesus Christ.",
