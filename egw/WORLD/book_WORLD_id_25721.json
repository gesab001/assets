    "word": "\"Neither pray I for these alone,\" Christ says; \"but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word; that they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which Thou gavest Me I \n\n\n                                   -190- \n\nhave given them; that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me. Father, I will that they also whom Thou hast given Me, be with me where I am; that they may behold My glory, which Thou hast given Me; for Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world.\"",
