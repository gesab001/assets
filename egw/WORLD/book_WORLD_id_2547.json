    "word": "R. & H., June 18, 1895\n     54. Man was the crowning act of the creation of God, made in the image of God, and designed to be a counterpart of God. . . . Man is very dear to God, because he was formed in His own image. This fact should impress us with the importance of teaching by precept and example the sin of defiling, by the indulgence of appetite or by any other sinful practice, the body which is designed to represent God to the world. \n     [NATURAL LAW PROCLAIMED DISTINCTLY--97]",
