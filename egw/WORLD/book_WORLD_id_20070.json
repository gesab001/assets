    "word": "Importance of Every Word--Every uttered word exerts an influence, every action involves a train of responsibility. No one can live to himself in this \n                                                                           50\nworld, even if he would. Each one forms a part of the great web of humanity, and through our individual threads of influence, we are linked to the universe. Christ used His influence to draw men to God, and He has left us an example of the way in which we should speak and act. A person who is molded by the Spirit of God will know how to speak a \"word in season to him that is weary,\" and will realize the highest human blessedness--the joy of imparting to others the precious treasures of the wisdom and grace of Christ. But those who permit themselves to be controlled by the enemy of all good will speak words which should never be uttered.-- RH Feb. 16, 1897.",
