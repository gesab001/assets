    "word": "Mission work must not cease because of limited means. Let every church member practice self-denial. The Word of God gives the commission, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" There is no restriction, no limit, to the work. And the promise is \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Abridge the work, limit your labors, and you remove your Helper. The sickly, unhealthy state of the church reveals a church afraid to work, fearing that self-denial will be required. The presence of the Lord is ever seen where every energy of the church is aroused to meet the spiritual responsibilities. But many of the churches who have had the light of present truth are dwarfed and crippled by the evils existing in their midst, by the selfishness cherished, by spending on self that which should be given to the Lord. Because of self-indulgence, they have nothing to give toward the work of saving souls.",
