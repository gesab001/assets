    "word": "Christ might have come to this world with a retinue of angels; but instead, He came as a babe, and lived a life of lowliness and poverty. His glory was in His simplicity. Shall we refuse to engage in medical missionary work unless we can follow the customs of the world, making a display such as worldlings make? To one who asked if he might follow Him, Christ said, \"Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay His head.\" Shall those who profess to be His followers refuse to engage in the work of helping their suffering fellow-beings unless they can be placed where their dignity will not be lessened?",
