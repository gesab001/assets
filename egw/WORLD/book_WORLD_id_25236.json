    "word": "The battle is between truth and the love of the world. Which will obtain the victory? Will they suffer Jesus to captivate the heart, or will they let Satan control the mind and crowd out the love of truth, so that the angels receive the charge, \"They are joined to their idols, let them alone\"? All must be given up for Jesus. There are idols that must be sacrificed, dross that must be consumed, in order to reflect the image of Jesus. Again and again has the heart been affected, but the world has come in and choked the good seed sown that it has not produced fruit to the glory of God.",
