    "word": "Let me tell you that there is no work that will tend to the upbuilding of the kingdom of Christ in this world that will not receive the deadly assaults of the enemy. There will be a continual wrestling. Walls of difficulty will arise, and objectionable things will appear to discourage those who can be discouraged, so that they will not fight on the side of truth, but unite their forces on the enemy's side, to question, to find fault, and to let unbelief come in, and then they will be of no help to push when every help is needed, at the very time when discouragement is likely to take the place of faith.",
