    "word": "Many are unconverted. They have hard hearts and unappreciative minds. Their eyes are blinded by self-indulgence. \"If our gospel be hid,\" Paul declares, \"it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them \n\n\n                                     -38- \n\nwhich believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ\" [2 Corinthians 4:3-6].",
