    "word": "We should reveal to the world that we are not beggars; that we are glad to do medical missionary work without price for those who can not pay. Here in California we shall need all the means that we can raise, to open up various lines of work in this state. We must be ready to help the sick whenever and wherever they need help. Medical missionary work is to be bound up with the gospel ministry. Thus it was in Christ's day. It is His helping hand, in healing, that will make the deepest impression on the minds of the people to whom we desire to proclaim the third angel's message. \n\n\n                                          Ellen G.
