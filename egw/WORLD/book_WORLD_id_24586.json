    "word": "Christ came to our world to restore the moral image of God in man, to elevate and ennoble our mental character, that our pursuits and aims in this life might not be misapplied and lost, and it is of the greatest consequence that every student in our schools obtain that knowledge that will enable him to cooperate with God in the grand work of forming characters after the divine pattern. We may carry with us all the treasure of knowledge that gives us a fitness for the life that measures with the life of God. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Christ came to our world to mold character and give mental power. His teachings were of an entirely practical nature.--Ms. 67, 1898, pp. 1, 2, 9. (\"Search the Scriptures,\" June 9, 1898.)",
