    "word": "God has a controversy with the churches today. They are fulfilling the prophecy of John. \"All nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\" They have divorced themselves from God by refusing to receive his sign. They have not the spirit of God's true commandment keeping people. And the people of the world in giving their sanction to a false sabbath, and in trampling under their feet the Sabbath of the Lord, have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.",
