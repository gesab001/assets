    "word": "Spiritual Nourishment--Of all professed Christians, Seventh-day Adventists should be foremost in uplifting Christ before the world. Our ministers should ever be able to direct men and women to Christ, to the One who Himself declared, \"I am the Bread of life.\" Let those who minister to the spiritual necessities of the people, read to them the words of Christ: \"I am the living Bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this Bread, he shall live forever: and the Bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" . . .",
