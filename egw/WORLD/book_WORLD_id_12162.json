    "word": "He Becomes Our Righteousness \n\n     Christ looks at the spirit, and when He sees us carrying our burden with faith, His perfect holiness atones for our shortcomings. When we do our best, He becomes our righteousness. It takes every ray of light that God sends to us to make us the light of the world.--Letter 22, 1889. [ORIGINALLY LISTED AS LETTER 33, THIS REFERENCE HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED AS LETTER 22, 1889.]",
