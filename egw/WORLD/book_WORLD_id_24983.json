    "word": "Although our Lord ascended from earth to heaven, the Holy Spirit was appointed as His representative among men. \"If ye love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless\" [John 14:15-18].",
