    "word": "The union between Christ and his people is to be living, true, and unfailing, resembling the union that exists between the Father and the Son. This union is the fruit of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. All true children of God will reveal to the world their union with Christ, and their brethren. Those in whose hearts Christ abides will bear the fruit of brotherly love. They will realize that as members of Christ's family they are pledged to cultivate, cherish, and perpetuate Christian love and fellowship, in spirit, words, and action. \n                                                                           110",
