    "word": "Men are needed who can and will take burdens and bear responsibilities in Battle Creek. The call has been given, time and again, but hardly a response has been made. Some would have answered the call, if their worldly interests would have been advanced by so doing. But as there was no prospect of increasing their means by coming to Battle Creek, they could see no duty to come. To obey is better than sacrifice. And without obedient and unselfish love, the richest offerings are too meager to be presented to the Possessor of all things.",
