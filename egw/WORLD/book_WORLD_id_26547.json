    "word": "Diet and Health\n\nNotes on Sermon Preached by Mrs. E. G. White at\nLos Angeles, California, May 16,1884\n\n     We are required, whether we eat or drink, to do all to the glory of God. One of the signs that we are in the last days is that this is not done. \"As it was in the days of Lot.\" Luke 17:28. Minds are too largely occupied with thoughts of what to eat or drink or wear. Men have no time to think of what will fit them for eternal life. Shall we not act like rational beings? The greatest question that ever occupied the human mind is, What shall I do to be saved? If the thoughts take a low plane, the character will be correspondingly low. But if the thoughts are led to grapple with the difficult problems in the Bible, the mind and character will be strengthened. In the world much time is given to matters of eating and drinking and dressing. Shall we be like the world, or shall we show that we cannot spend our time as they do? Be careful not to go to extremes.",
