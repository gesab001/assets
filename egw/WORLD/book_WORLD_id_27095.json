    "word": "Truth a Unit \n\n     God's people are not to be in confusion, lacking order and harmony, consistency and  beauty. The Lord is greatly dishonored when unity does not exist among His people. Truth is a unit. The unity that God requires must be cultivated day by day, if we would answer the prayer of Christ. The disunion that is striving for existence among those who claim to believe the last message of mercy to be given to the world must find no place; for it would be a fearful hindrance to the advancement of God's work. His servants are to be one, as Christ is one with the Father, their powers, illuminated, inspired, and sanctified, united to make a complete whole. Those who love God and keep His commandments are not to draw apart; they are to press together.",
