    "word": "Case after case of this nature has transpired during the world's history, and the test will come to all who are obeying the truth. He that seeks to save his life shall lose it; but on the other hand, he that is willing to lose his life for the sake of truth shall find eternal life. We want to know that heaven is interested in our welfare. Christ and angels are looking on with intense interest to see if the souls of men appreciate the great sacrifice in their behalf. We should constantly consider that we are in the presence of holy angels.",
