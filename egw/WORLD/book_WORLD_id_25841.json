    "word": "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to save mankind from perishing. He has placed heaven within their reach, and thus He has claims upon every man. He has given them His commandments to observe, and although they may ignore His claims, yet they cannot throw them off; it is His law that is to govern heaven and earth. And when they forget God and serve themselves, the fear of God is not before them, and sin to them is not sin. Iniquity prevails, and just before the appearing of the Son of man in [the] heavens Satan will appear, to attract men, and if it were possible he would deceive the very elect. Here are the transgressors of God's law, and Satan, who was the \n\n\n                                   -135- \n\nfirst transgressor, leading them on. Can you wonder that iniquity prevails everywhere? And just prior to the coming of the Son of man their minds are employed in eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage, and heaven is put out from their minds.",
