    "word": "Worldly policy plans are not to be woven into the pattern that the Lord's people have been given. To those who receive Him, Christ gives power to become the sons of God, even to as many as believe on His name. God declares, \"I will put My laws in their minds.\" David's prayer expresses this same precious assurance:\"Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they that keep His testimonies, and that seek Him with the whole heart. They also do no iniquity, they walk in His way. Thou hast commanded me to keep Thy precepts diligently. Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all Thy commandments. I will praise Thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned Thy righteous judgments. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto according to Thy word. With my whole heart have I sought Thee; O, let me not wander from Thy commandments.\"",
