    "word": "The class of education given at the Madison school is such as will be accounted a treasure of great value by those who take up missionary work in foreign fields. My brethren, let no hindrance be placed in the way of men and women who are seeking to gain such an education as those at the Madison school are receiving. They are working after the Lord's directions. If many more in other schools were receiving a similar training, we as a people would become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. The message should quickly be carried to every country, and souls now in darkness would be brought to the light. These men under the special light the Lord has given are not to be hindered in any way, for the Lord is leading them.",
