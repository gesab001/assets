    "word": "Follow on, young men, to know the Lord, and you will know that \"His going forth is prepared as the morning.\" [Hosea 6:3.] Seek constantly to improve. Strive earnestly for close fellowship with the Redeemer. Live by faith in Christ. Do the work He did. Live for the saving of the souls for whom He laid down His life. Try in every way to help those with whom you come in contact .... Talk with your Elder Brother, who will complete your education line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. A close connection with Him who offered Himself as a sacrifice to save a perishing world, will make you acceptable workers.--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. VI, page 416. \n\n[98]",
