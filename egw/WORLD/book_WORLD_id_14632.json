    "word": "I saw that the young profess, but do not enjoy the saving power of God. They lack religion, lack salvation. And O, the idle, unprofitable words they speak. There is a faithful, fearful record kept of them, and mortals will be judged according to the deeds done in the body. Young friends, your deeds, and your idle words are written in the Book. Your conversation has not been on eternal things, but upon this, that, and the other--common, worldly conversation that christians should not engage in. It is all written in the Book.",
