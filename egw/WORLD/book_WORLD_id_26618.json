    "word": "John pointed the people to the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world. He said, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" There is a great deal in that \"taketh away.\" The question is, Shall we keep on sinning as though it were an impossibility for us to overcome? How are we to overcome? As Christ overcame. He prayed to His heavenly Father; we can do the same, and that is the only way. Then we are to overcome something, for it is stated that those who shall see Him in His beauty shall be \"without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.\" Now, if there is a spot or wrinkle in your character, is it not now the very time for you to begin to understand what that defilement is, that you may trust in the blood of Christ to wash it away?",
