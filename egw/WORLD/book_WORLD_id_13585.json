    "word": "What a terrible thing it is to darken the pathway of others by bringing shadow and gloom upon ourselves! Let each one take heed to himself. Charge not upon others your defections of character. . . . Talk light; walk in the light. \"God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.\". . . Gather to your souls the courage that can come only from the Light of the world.",
