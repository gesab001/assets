    "word": "We are to have faith in the living God who made the world and all things that are therein, and who overrules all events to His own name's glory. We are to be examples to the world, as those who uphold the everlasting principles of truth, justice, and purity. We are to have faith in Christ, faith in His power to redeem the soul and keep it in perfect peace. The world's Redeemer will draw us to Himself with the cords of a man, with bands of love.",
