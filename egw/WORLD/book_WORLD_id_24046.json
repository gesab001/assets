    "word": "MR No. 488 - Demas\n\n     Demas was a convert to Christianity. He was received into full communion with the church. He is mentioned in connection with Luke the beloved physician. \"Luke the beloved physician, and Demas greet you,\" writes Paul. In another letter he sends greeting to Demas. But again we find him writing, \"Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me; for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world.\" He chose the world before Christ, and this was the cause of his failure. It is the cause of the failure of many who claim to be Christians. We all need to see our weakness, and strive to remedy our faults of character, else we shall surely become as Demas,--drawn away from safe paths into worldly projects and ambitious plans. Thus we shall make shipwreck of our faith.--Letter 66, 1897, p. 8. (To A. R. Henry, August, 1897.) \n\nReleased April 28, 1976.",
