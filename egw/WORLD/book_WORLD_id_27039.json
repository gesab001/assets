    "word": "Only think of the infinite sacrifice that has made this salvation possible. We should study the Word, that we may see more of its magnitude. Jesus Christ has bought us with a price. He laid aside His royal robe and His kingly crown in the heavenly courts. He clothed His divinity with humanity \n and came to this sin-cursed earth, that humanity might be a partaker of divinity, and, through obedience and love to God, might escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. He has thrown His arms of infinite love around humanity, and will draw unto Himself all who will come. But if some will persist in having their own way, He cannot bless them, for they will not come unto Him, that they might have life.",
