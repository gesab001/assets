    "word": "Christ calls for young men who will volunteer to carry the truth to the world. Men of spiritual stamina are wanted; men who are able to find work close at hand, because they are looking for it. The church needs new men to give energy to the ranks; men for the times, able to cope with its errors; men who will inspire with fresh zeal the flagging efforts of the few laborers; men whose hearts are warm with Christian love, and whose hands are eager to do the Master's work. \n\n\n                                               (13)",
