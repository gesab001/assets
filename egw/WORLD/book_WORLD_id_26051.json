    "word": "Day by day the Lord cares for mankind, giving them sunshine, rain, and dew, increasing the vegetation, bringing forth the variety of fruits, each in its season, all as a continual blessing to mankind. Should not those who receive so bountifully from the hand of God become producers as well as consumers? Should they not return to Him His own in tithes and offerings? By putting their talents out to a wise use, men increase their blessings. By putting their money to use in the Lord's work of soul-saving they may lay up treasure in the heavens. Our Redeemer seeks to strengthen the desire of every one to seek the heavenly, the eternal treasure. And He is not unmindful of our peace and comfort in this world.",
