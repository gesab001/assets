    "word": "Men, saved only by the atoning sacrifice of Christ Jesus, have no right to seek to exalt themselves above their fellow men. Let them sit at the feet of Jesus, and learn of him, striving not to make themselves shine. If the love of Jesus Christ abides in them, they will shine unconsciously, diffusing the light of the glory of Christ through the world. \"I, if I be lifted up,\" Christ said, \"will draw all men unto me.\" If a minister makes Christ his hope, his trust, his dependence, he is one with Christ, a laborer together with God; and by his ministry, souls are converted to Christ. \n\n\n                    - 43 -",
