    "word": "MR No. 1287 - Workers in Food Business to Emphasize Spiritual Values and Witnessing\n\n     I am entrusted with a message. In our food work have we not been walking and working more nearly after the pattern of the world than after the pattern of Christ? What words have we spoken to the large multitudes we have fed? How are we presenting to these souls the Bread of Life? Can Christ say to us, \"Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\"? Can each worker truthfully say, \"My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work\"?",
