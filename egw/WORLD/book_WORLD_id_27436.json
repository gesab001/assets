    "word": "The infinite treasures of truth have been accumulating from age to age. No representation could adequately impress us with the extent, the richness, of these vast resources. They are awaiting the demand of those who appreciate them. These gems of truth are to be gathered up by God's remnant people, to be given by them to the world; but self-confidence and obduracy of soul refuse the blessed treasure. \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Such love cannot be measured, neither can it be expressed. John calls upon the world to \"behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God.\" It is a love that passeth knowledge. In the fullness of the sacrifice, nothing was withheld: Jesus gave himself. God designs that his people shall love one another as Christ loved us. They are to educate and train the soul for this love. They are to reflect this love in their own character, to reflect it to the world. Each should look upon this as his work. In his prayer to the Father, Jesus said: \"As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.\" Christ's fullness is to be presented to the world by those who have become partakers of his grace. They are to do that for Christ which Christ did for the Father,-- represent his character.",
