Fagal, evangelist and teacher, for use in an Andrews University term paper on foot washing.] \n\n                Christ's Presence Felt at Feet-Washing Ceremony \n\n     January 1, 1859. The commencement of another year. My husband went down into the water and buried seven with Christ in baptism. Two of them were but children. One prayed earnestly in the water to be kept unspotted from the world. As Jesus was raised from the dead so the candidates were raised up out of the water. May they live a new life unto God. Will they be enabled to crucify self and imitate the self-denying life of Jesus?",
