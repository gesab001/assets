    "word": "Satan and his angels will appear on this earth as men, and will mingle with those of whom God's word declares, \"Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\" The world is full of men and women whom Satan uses as his agencies.

They are blind, and have forgotten that they were purged from their sins. \n                                                                           3",
