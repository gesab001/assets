    "word": "The One Source of Abiding Peace.--Abiding peace, true rest of spirit, has but one source. It was of this that Christ spoke when He said, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). \"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you\" (John 14:27). This peace is not something that He gives apart from Himself. It is in Christ, and we can receive it only by receiving Him.--MH 247 (1905).",
