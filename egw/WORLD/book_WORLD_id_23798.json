    "word": "I entreat of you to delay not to open the fields that so greatly need attention, and that have scarcely been touched. This is your work. There is \n\n\n                                    -74- \n\nneed of a reformation in the work that God has pointed out for you to do in opening new fields. There is much to be done in bringing before the world the light of Bible truth in its sacred simplicity, and you both need to be revived by the influence of the Holy Spirit of God. Let the refining grace of truth lead you into the deepest experience of consecration and sanctification.",
