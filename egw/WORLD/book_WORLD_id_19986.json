    "word": "Christ spoke on every subject with authority. Every truth that it was essential for His people to have was revealed in His teachings with the unfaltering assurance of certain knowledge. He uttered no sophistries, no mere probabilities, no human opinions quoted by men--only truths. His assertions were principles established by personal knowledge. He foresaw the delusive doctrines that would fill the world, but He expressed not one of them. No idle tales, no false theories clothed in beautiful language, came from the lips of the Great Teacher. In all His teachings He dwelt upon the unchangeable positions of Bible truth. Christ . . . came to express the ideal of all truth. He unfolded gem after gem of precious truth. . . .",
