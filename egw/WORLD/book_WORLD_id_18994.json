    "word": "A great and solemn work is before the people of God. They are to come close to Christ in self-denial and self-sacrifice, their one aim being to give the message of mercy to all the world. Some will work in one way and some in another, as the Lord shall call and lead them. But they are all to strive together, seeking to make the work a perfect whole. With pen and voice God's servants are to labor for Him. The printed word of truth is to be translated into different tongues. To all peoples the gospel is to be preached. . . .",
