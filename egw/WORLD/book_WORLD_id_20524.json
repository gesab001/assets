    "word": "The only way the truth can be presented to the world, in its pure and holy character, is for those who claim to believe it to be exponents of its power. The Bible requires the sons and daughters of God to stand on an elevated platform; for God calls upon them to represent Christ to the world. As they represent Christ, they represent the Father. Unity of believers testifies of their oneness with Christ, and this unity is required by the accumulated light which now shines upon the pathway of the children of God.--Review and Herald, Feb. 25, 1890.",
