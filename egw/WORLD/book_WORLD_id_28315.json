    "word": "(535) From talk given by Mrs. E. G. White, Loma Linda, Oct. 30, 1907. \n\n\n     Here (at Loma Linda) we have ideal advantages for a school and for a sanitarium. Here are advantages for the patients. I have been instructed that here we should have a school, conducted on the principles of the ancient schools of the prophets. It may not be carried on, in every respect, as are the schools of the world, but it is to be especially adapted for those who desire to devote their lives, not to commercial pursuits, but to unselfish service for the Master.",
