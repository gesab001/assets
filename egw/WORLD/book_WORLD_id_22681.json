    "word": "If the Sanitarium shall retrograde as rapidly in the future as it has done in the past, in introducing worldly amusements and theatrical performances, the Lord will withdraw his protecting care from that institution. His frown is upon all these things. They are not essential for the prosperity of the Sanitarium \n                                                                           70\nor for the health of the patients. The more they have of this kind of amusements, the less will they be pleased, unless something of the kind shall be continually carried on. The mind is in a fever of unrest for something new and exciting,--the very thing it ought not to have. And if these amusements are once allowed, they are expected again, and the patients lose their relish for any simple arrangement to occupy the time. But repose, rather than excitement, is what many of the patients need.",
