Great changes may be wrought by well-directed, prayerful, earnest efforts, by each one trying to do his best in the sight of God. Individuals must make improvement, and cease educating themselves in critical ways and habits. Let each one consider that others may find just as objectionable traits in their characters as can be found in those who have been severely criticized and condemned. Let every human agent employ his ability in doing good to others, in bringing their lives in accordance with the principles of Christ. Let each one individually do that which his hands find to do, practice economy, bind about his wants, and save something from his meager store to sustain the work and cause of God.",
