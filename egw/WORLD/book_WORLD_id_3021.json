    "word": "Those who live to gratify appetite and selfish desire, will lose the favor of God, and will lose the heavenly reward. They testify to the world that they have not genuine faith, and when they seek to impart to others a knowledge of present truth, the world will regard their words as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. Let everyone show his faith by his works. \"Faith without works is dead,\" \"being alone.\" \"Wherefore show ye to them and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting in your behalf.\"--R. & H., Aug. 21, 1894.",
