    "word": "For many years the Lord has been sending testimonies of encouragement, instruction, warning, and reproof to Dr. Kellogg, but because of his great confidence in his own plans, and work, the doctor has failed to comprehend or to heed many of the counsels which were essential to his welfare. The position that he has taken with men of the world, binding himself up with them, gives evidence that instead of becoming established in the truth, he is departing from the faith. His theology is not sound; his mind is confused, and unless he sees his danger, his foundation will be swept away when the test comes. Unless he sees his danger and makes a decided change, he can not be endorsed as a safe, all-round teacher for the students who go to Battle Creek to study in medical missionary lines.",
