    "word": "The Lord designs that the proclamation of the third angel's message shall be the highest, greatest work carried on in our world at this time.

In every line of your work you were to understand and practice the truth. You were to make God first, and ever obey His word. In this would be your strength. \n\n\n                                   - 88 -",
