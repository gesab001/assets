    "word": "\"The world is not to be condemned until after it has had the light. We must tell people the simple story of the cross. They are to be pitied, and just as much as possible we must soften the message we bring to them. This will soften their hearts, so that the Spirit of the Lord can mold them. In all their past life they have been receiving false ideas. If we come close to them, and tell them of the love of Christ, we can do much for them.\"",
