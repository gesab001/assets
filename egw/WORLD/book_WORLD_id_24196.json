    "word": "Teachers must be qualified to be ministers of righteousness. Their pathway must be kept free from any hindrance, in order that students may find in the school which they attend, a city of refuge. They should help those whom they are educating to disconnect from worldly influences and worldly associations, teaching them to obey the word of God, \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters.\" (2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.) What honor and exaltation is here given to humanity. Shall we not obey this invitation with grateful hearts?--Ms 20, 1895, pp. 1-4. (\"True Education,\" November 10, 1895.)",
