    "word": "Many a youth who is ignorant of the world, ignorant of his own weakness, ignorant of the future, feels no need of a Divine hand to point out his course. He considers himself fully competent to guide his own bark amid the breakers. Let such youth remember that wherever they may go, they are not beyond the domain of God. They are not free to choose what they will without consulting the will of their Creator.",
