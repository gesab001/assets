    "word": "When Christ shall appear, then we all want to stand with the redeemed. The gates of the city will swing back on their glittering hinges, and the nations that have kept the truth will enter in. A crown will be placed on every head. The words will be spoken, \"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" Matthew 25:34. Whom is it prepared for? For the obedient--those who keep His commandments to do His will.",
