    "word": "Let every Seventh-day Adventist ask himself, \"What can I do to proclaim the third angel's message?\" Christ came to this world to give this message to His servant to give to the churches. It is to be proclaimed to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. How are we to give it? The distribution of our literature is one means by which the message is to be proclaimed. Let every believer scatter broadcast tracts and leaflets and books containing the message for this time. Colporteurs are needed who will go forth to circulate our publications everywhere.--Southern Watchman, Jan. 5, 1904.",
