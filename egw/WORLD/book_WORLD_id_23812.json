    "word": "The instruction given by Christ is clear and easy to be understood. It is the duty of every soul to understand for himself his appointed work. He is not to grope his way along in darkness and uncertainty, depending on human guidance. Christ has said, \"I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\"",
