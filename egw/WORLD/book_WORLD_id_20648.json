    "word": "He who has paid the infinite price to redeem men, reads with unerring accuracy all the hidden workings of the human mind, and knows just how to deal with every soul. And in dealing with men, he manifests the same principles that are manifest in the natural world. The beneficent operations of Nature are not accomplished by abrupt and startling interpositions; men are not permitted to take her work into their own hands. God works through the calm, regular operation of his appointed laws. So it is in spiritual things. Satan is constantly seeking to produce effects by rude and violent thrusts; but Jesus found access to minds by the pathway of their most familiar associations. He disturbed as little as possible their accustomed train of thought, by abrupt actions or prescribed rules. He honored man with his confidence, and thus placed him on his honor. He introduced old truths in a new and precious light. Thus when only twelve years old, he astonished the doctors of the law by his questions in the temple.",
