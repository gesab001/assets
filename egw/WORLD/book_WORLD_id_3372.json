    "word": "There are great possibilities in the human understanding when connected with the True Teacher, who in His presentation of the things of the natural world revealed truth in its practical bearings. God works all unseen upon the human heart; for without the divine power operating upon the understanding, the mind of man cannot grasp the sentiments of elevating, ennobling truth. It cannot read the book of nature, nor can it understand the simplicity of godliness found therein. When the human mind is freed from perverting influences, it can receive the lessons of Christ. But no man can understand the true science of education, only as God in His wisdom shall through the Holy Spirit sanctify his observation. \n\n                                               -",
