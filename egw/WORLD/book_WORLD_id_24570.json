    "word": "Never was there a place where medical missionary work would have told with more power than in Australia. But in our efforts to do this work we have been handicapped for want of means.

The Lord Jesus Christ was the greatest physician this world has ever known. We cannot in the full sense of the word call him a medical missionary. He was the divine Healer. He was imbued with power to heal all manner of diseases without resorting to drugs.",
