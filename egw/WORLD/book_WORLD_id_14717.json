    "word": "I was shown that some have no tact at wise management of worldly matters. They lack the qualifications, and Satan takes advantage of them. When this is the case, such should not remain in ignorance of their lack. They should be humble enough to counsel with their brethren, whose judgment they can have confidence in, before they carry out plans. I was directed to this \n                                                                           42\ntext, \"Bear ye one another's burdens.\" Some are not humble enough to let those who have judgment, calculate for them, until they have followed their own plans, and they involved themselves in difficulties. Then they see the necessity of having the counsel and judgments of their brethren; but how much heavier the burden then, than at the first. Brethren should not  go to law, if it can be possibly avoided; for they give the enemy great advantage to entangle and perplex them. It would be better to make a settlement at some loss.",
