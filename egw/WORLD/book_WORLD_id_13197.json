    "word": "The Last Act in the Drama.--The substitution of the false for the true is the last act in the drama. When this substitution becomes universal, God will reveal Himself. When the laws of men are exalted above the laws of God, when the powers of this earth try to force men to keep the first day of the week, know that the time has come for God to work. He will arise in His majesty, and will shake terribly the earth. He will come out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the world for their iniquity (RH April 23, 1901).  {7BC 980.10}  \n     (Verse 1-4; chs. 7:2, 3; 13:13, 16; Exodus 31:13-17; 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4.) The Mark of Distinction.--We are nearing the close of this \n                                                                           981\nearth's history. Satan is making desperate efforts to make himself god, to speak and act like God, to appear as one who has a right to control the consciences of men. He strives with all his power to place a human institution in the position of God's holy rest day. Under the jurisdiction of the man of sin, men have exalted a false standard in complete opposition to God's enactment. Each Sabbath institution bears the name of its author, an ineffaceable mark showing the authority of each. The first day of the week has not one particle of sanctity. It is the production of the man of sin, who strives in this way to counterwork God's purposes.  {7BC 980.11} \n     God has designated the seventh day as His Sabbath. [Exodus 31:13, 17, 16 quoted.]",
