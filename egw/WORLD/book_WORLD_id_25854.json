    "word": "All the world is under the most solemn responsibility to obey God's law. Parents should educate their children line upon line, precept upon precept, not allowing any disregard of God's holy law. They should rely upon divine power, asking the Lord to help them to keep their children true to Him who gave His only begotten Son to bring the disloyal and disobedient back to their allegiance. God longs to pour upon men and women the rich current of His love. He longs to see them delighting to do His will, using every jot of their entrusted powers in His service, teaching all who come within the sphere of their influence that the way to be treated as righteous for Christ's sake is to obey the law. Only those who walk in the light of God's Word have the evidence that they are accepted by Him.",
