    "word": "God has chosen a people out of the world, and has instructed them to remain forever separate from the world. While living in the world they are not to be of the world. Dr. Kellogg has bound himself with worldlings by inviting them into his councils; and he has been dishonoring the sacredness of the truth by bringing worldly lawyers into connection with the work of God's people. The Lord has signified that it is His purpose (104) to keep His people free from the contaminating influence of the world but the leaders of the medical work at Battle Creek have been working in a way altogether different from the way marked out by the Lord. The first and the second chapters of 1 Peter are full of instruction in regard to the manner in which we should labor.",
