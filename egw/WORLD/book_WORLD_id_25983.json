    "word": "\"I beseech you therefore, brethren, \"writes the apostle Paul, \"by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God\" [Romans 12:1, 2]. The Lord requires a living sacrifice of mind, soul, body, and strength. All that we have and are is to be given to Him, that we may answer the purpose of our creation. But unless we take heed to the light and instruction given us in the Word of God, that in the matter of eating and drinking we may speak and act intelligently, we shall bring feebleness upon our selves.",
