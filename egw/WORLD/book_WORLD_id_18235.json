    "word": "The Lord's resources are unlimited; we are only instruments in His hands, and great things can be accomplished through His name. \u201cIf ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my \n24\nFather glorified, that ye bear much fruit.\u201d We are so familiar with our own peculiar traits of character that we often think too highly of self, we become satisfied, and do not seek to improve as we should. Sanctification through the truth requires a daily improvement in manner, address, attitude, and spirit. If we are branches of the true vine, we shall bear fragrant blossoms and desirable fruit. In our feebleness and ignorance we cannot depend upon ourselves; we must not think that there are no improvements to be made, for we are to learn daily in the school of Christ, not how to reach the highest place, but to become meek and lowly of heart, pure and undefiled, rising above cheapness and the commonplace. We have intercourse with the eternal world, and we must reveal all the light which we have received from heaven. Our thoughts must not run in a low, narrow channel, but we must be learners, constantly receiving clearer views, and higher and holier aspirations. Be sure to pray and counsel together before coming to decisions and laying your plans, and then, in the spirit of Christ, push the work unitedly. If one of your number decides that he cannot co-operate with his brethren, and has no desire to work because of differences of opinion, the course to be pursued is without a question. Humble yourselves before God, and resort to prayer, for you cannot and must not attempt to work at variance.",
