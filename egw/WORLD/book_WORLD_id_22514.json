    "word": "\"The Lord will work in behalf of all who will walk humbly with him. He has placed you in a position of trust. Walk carefully before him. He is leading you. God's hand is on the wheel. He will guide the ship through the rocks into the haven. He will take the weak things of this world to confound the things which are mighty. You are not amenable to any man, but are under God's direction. Keep close to him. Do not take worldly ideas as your criterion. Be of good courage in your work.\"",
