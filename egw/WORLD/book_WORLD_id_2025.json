    "word": "Enoch was a marked character. Many look upon his life as something above what the generality of mortals can ever reach. But Enoch's life and character . . . represent what the lives and characters of all must be, if like Enoch, they are subjects to be translated when Christ shall come. His life was what the life of every individual may be if he closely connects with God. We should remember that Enoch was surrounded with influences so depraved that God brought a flood of waters on the world to destroy its inhabitants for their corruption.",
