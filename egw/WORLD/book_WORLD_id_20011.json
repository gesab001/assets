    "word": "Christ says, \"Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it\" (Revelation 3:8). Then let us not discourage others by talking of defects of character. Talk of the light. Heaven is full of light. Christ is the Light of the world. Speak hopeful words, strong, comforting words. Look away from the imperfections of others, and by your practical godliness show those around you the better way.",
