    "word": "I call upon those who are at Battle Creek, losing their faith and losing their first love, to come away, and take hold of the work of God in neglected fields, as soon as they have recovered from the influence of the seducing theories that have threatened to spoil them for the ministry of the word and for the precious missionary work in which they might engage were they fully established in the faith. Actions speak louder than words. A world is perishing in sin, and God calls for workers. He wants one thousand at work in the highways and in the hedges, where now there is but one. We have no time to listen to idle tales and false science. The faith of many will be revived when they will humble their hearts before God, and go forth to fulfill the commission of Christ, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\"",
