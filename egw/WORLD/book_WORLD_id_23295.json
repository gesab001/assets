    "word": "Some will tell us that the word of God is like a fiddle and any construction can be put on it. This belief is due to the rejection of God's law, and confusion follows. If the law were kept, this statement could not be made. But when men tear down the commandments how can they know the will of God? The law was given at the foundation of the world, and it will exist through all generations; but when man forgets God by disobedience, then he places himself where he does not know the doctrine.",
