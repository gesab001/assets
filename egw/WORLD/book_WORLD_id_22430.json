    "word": "Copy The Pattern. \n\n     God would have every soul copy the Pattern; as he was in the world, so are his followers to be. It is not in the order of God that men should be harsh, unsympathetic, without the grace of love and patience, without true affection for others. Paul says, \"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ.\" Said Job, \"Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the poor?\" We only can let our light shine to the glory of God when we manifest the goodness and mercy of Christ, not only toward those who please us, but toward those who are faulty and erring and sinful. Let all our works be wrought in God, and \n\n\n                        -29- \n\nif we have unamiable traits of character, let us overcome these unsavory representatives, and cease to dishonor God and bring the truth into disrepute.",
