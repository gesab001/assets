    "word": "God was to be manifest in Christ, \u201creconciling the world unto himself.\u201d Human beings had become so degraded by sin that it was impossible for them, in themselves, to come into harmony with Him whose nature is purity and goodness. But Christ, after having redeemed them from the condemnation of the law, could impart divine power to unite with human effort. Thus by repentance toward God and faith in Christ the fallen children of Adam might once more become \u201csons of God.\u201dPatriarchs and Prophets, pp. 63, 64.",
