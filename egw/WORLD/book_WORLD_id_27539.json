    "word": "This is the very course men will take who are now in office. The world today is full of flatterers and dissemblers but God forbid that those who claim to be guardians of sacred trusts shall betray sacred interests through the instigations, suggestions, and devices of Satan. I have a warning to give to this body assembled in this house in General Conference. There is danger of our institutions creating plans and ways and means that mean not success, but defeat. I dare not let this Conference close and those assembled return to their homes without telling you to consider carefully every proposition \n                                                                           945\npresented, every plan laid before you. Give not hastily to these plans your \"yea\" and \"amen,\" and be not carried away with propositions that appear innocent, but whose end is disaster and forfeiture of the favor of God.",
