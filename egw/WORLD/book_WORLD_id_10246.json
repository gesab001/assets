    "word": "If we meet obstacles in our path, and faithfully overcome them; if we encounter opposition and reproach, and in Christ\u2019s name gain the victory; if we bear responsibilities and discharge our duties in the spirit of our Master\u2014then, indeed, we gain a precious knowledge of His faithfulness and power. We no longer depend upon the experience of others, for we have the witness in ourselves.
