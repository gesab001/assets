    "word": "You may say at the Health Retreat there is no danger of this at all; but I tell you there is danger. This work is continually going on. If souls are not overcome, if their feet do not go into strange paths, it is because they have their eyes anointed clearly to discern the wiles of the enemy, and have their lives hid with Christ in God, and a new, supernatural, divine life is linked with theirs. Those who are one with Christ do not boast of their wisdom or their capabilities, for they feel their inefficiency and weakness, and this leads them to hunger and thirst after righteousness. They trust in One mighty to save to the uttermost all that come unto Him and put their trust in Him. The value of the fellowship of those who love and serve God, the benefits of their counsel, will not, cannot be discerned by those who are mingling their interests with those who care not for the Lord or His truth. By beholding men become changed, and those who mingle with the world find the world more to their natural taste than do those who love and fear God, who seek to conform their lives to His requirements. But Jesus has said concerning those who do His will, \"I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the wind blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.\"",
