    "word": "There are many kinds of intemperance in this world. Overeating is intemperance just as surely as liquor-drinking. Intemperate eating mars the system, producing a morbid appetite, which enslaves men and women. The stomach must have careful attention. It must not be kept in continual operation. Give this much used and much abused organ some peace and quiet and rest. After it has done its work for one meal, do not crowd more work upon it before it has had a chance to rest, and before a sufficient quantity of gastric juice is provided. Five hours at least should be given between each meal, and always bear in mind that if you would give it a trial, you would find that two meals would be better than three.",
