    "word": "There are many in this age of the world who act as if they were at liberty to question the words of the Infinite, to review His decisions and statutes, endorsing, revising, reshaping, and annulling at their pleasure. We are never safe while we are guided by human opinions, but we are safe when we are guided by a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" We cannot trust the salvation of our souls to any lower standard than the decisions of an infallible Judge.",
