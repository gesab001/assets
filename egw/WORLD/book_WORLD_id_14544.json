    "word": "NOTE 6. PAGE 268.--ALMOST ALL ADVENTISTS, INCLUDING MR. MILLER, DID, FOR A SHORT TIME AFTER THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT IN 1844, BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD HAD RECEIVED ITS LAST WARNING. THEY COULD HARDLY THINK OTHERWISE, WITH THEIR FAITH IN THE MESSAGE WHICH THEY HAD GIVEN,--\"THE HOUR OF HIS JUDGMENT IS COME.\" REVELATION 14:6, 7. THEY NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS PROCLAMATION MUST CLOSE THE DISPENSATION. THEY WERE AS UNABLE TO FIND THEIR BEARINGS AT ONCE AS WERE THE DISCIPLES WHEN THEIR LORD, WHOM THEY HAD HAILED AS THEIR KING COMING TO HIS THRONE, WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED. IN BOTH CASES THEY WERE UNABLE TO COMPREHEND THEIR TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT.",
