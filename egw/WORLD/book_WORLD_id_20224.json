    "word": "Be Sure We Are Working for Jesus.--Our sisters are not excused from taking a part in the work of God. Everyone who has tasted of the powers of the world to come has earnest work to do in some capacity in the Lord's vineyard. Our sisters may manage to keep busy with their fingers constantly employed in manufacturing little dainty articles to beautify their homes or to present to their friends. Great quantities of this kind of material may be brought and laid upon the foundation stone, but will Jesus look upon all this variety of dainty work as a living sacrifice to Himself? Will He pronounce the commendation upon the workers, \"I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience,\" and how thou \"hast borne, and hast patience, and for My name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted\"?",
