    "word": "The demon of heresy has mapped out the world, and has resolved to possess it as his kingdom. Those who are in his army are numerous; they are disguised and are subtle and persevering. They resist every divine influence, and employ every instrumentality in order to compass the ruin of even one soul. They possess a zeal, tact, and ability that is marvelous, and press their way into every new opening where the standard of truth is uplifted. What will the laborers together with God do? Wherein lies their ability and efficiency? Those who are workers together with God will work in Christ's lines. Imbued with the Spirit of Christ, they will rise to their true dignity and responsibility. The church is not to fold her hands in security, and say, \"I am rich, and increased with goods, and in need of nothing.\" The followers of Christ are not to trust to past experience, and fail to go on to perfection. In so doing the church will meet with defeat and ruin.",
