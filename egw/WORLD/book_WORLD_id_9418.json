    "word": "Christ and Conformity.--How wonderful is the work of grace upon the human heart! It gives mental power, wisdom to use the talent of means, not in self-pleasing but through self-denial, to carry forward missionary work. Christ, the Son of God, was a missionary to our world. He says, \"Whoso will follow, let him forsake all.\" You cannot love Him while copying the fashions of the world or enjoying worldly society.--Lt 238, 1907.",
