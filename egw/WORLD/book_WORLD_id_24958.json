    "word": "Saith the Lord, \"My people shall be baptized with My Holy Spirit to do a sharp, quick work. All who will now draw apart from worldly customs, and will seek Me with the whole heart, will find Me. Let each one stand humbly in his lot and in his place looking to Me, their Saviour. I will instruct the ignorant. I will anoint men with heavenly eyesalve, that My people may see clearly the work that needs to be done. If they will walk in My footsteps I will open ways before them, not only in the lowly places, but in the highways. I will raise up agents who will carry out the principles of truth. They shall stand in their lot and in their place, looking to Me, their Guide and Counselor.\"",
