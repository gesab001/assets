    "word": "\"Take heed, therefore, how ye hear\" (Luke 8:18), is an admonition of Christ. We are to hear for the sake of learning the truth, that we may walk in it. And again: \"Take heed what ye hear\" (Mark 4:24). Examine closely, \"prove all things\" (1 Thessalonians 5:21), \"believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world\" (1 John 4:1). This is the counsel of God; shall we heed it?-- Letter 12, 1890.",
