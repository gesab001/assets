    "word": "The question of religious liberty is very important, and it should be handled with great wisdom and discretion. Unless this is done, there is danger that by our own course of action we shall bring upon ourselves a crisis before we are prepared for it. The burden of \n\n\n                         - 53 - \n\nour message should be \"the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\" Our brethren should be cautioned to make moves that will not stir up and provoke the powers that be, so that they will make moves that will limit the work, and cut us off from proclaiming the message in different localities. We need more of the working of the Infinite, and far less trust in human agencies. We are to prepare a people to stand in the day of God's preparation, we are to call men's attention to the cross of Calvary, to make clear the reason why Christ made his great sacrifice. We are to show men that it is possible for them to come back to their allegiance to God and to their obedience to his commandments. When the sinner looks upon Christ as the propitiation for his sins, let men step aside. Let them declare to the sinner that Christ \"is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.\" Encourage him to seek wisdom from God; for through earnest prayer he will learn the way of the Lord more perfectly, than if instructed by some human counselor. He will see that it was the transgression of the law that caused the death of the Son of the infinite God, and he will hate the sins that wounded Jesus. As he looks upon Christ as a compassionate, tender High Priest, his heart will be preserved in contrition.",
