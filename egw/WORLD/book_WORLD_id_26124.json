    "word": "The whole heavenly universe is interested, and the law of God is exercised in behalf of His faithful, commandment-keeping people. It is God in whom we must trust. It is only a narrow minded government that legislates for the suppression of God's law. God has the world in His hand. We have God on our side. All heaven is waiting and longing for our cooperation. The Lord is supreme. Why should we fear? The Lord is almighty; why should we tremble? In the past God has delivered His people, and He will be our helper if we will arise in His strength and go forward.",
