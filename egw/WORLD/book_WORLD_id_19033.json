    "word": "You can have rest and peace only as you find it in Jesus. The world, its maxims and its customs, are the parents of unnumbered sufferings. Many suffer with ungratified wishes. They bind burdens on themselves--their ungratified desires. With the condemnation of conscience--not having harmony with God, and with an apprehension of His displeasure and wrath--their existence is a matter of continual anxiety. There is a dearth of heavenly consolation in suffering. They are fearful of punishment. There is a fearful foreboding of the future. . . .",
