    "word": "MR No. 947 - Letter to Emma Weber\n\n     Dear Sister Weber: I wish to speak with you particularly. Last night my guide opened before me some things in regard to you, Sister Emma, in connection with Dr. Dowse. The Lord gave me words to speak to you both, but to you especially. Seek ye first the kingdom of God and grace shall be given you. You are not able to walk alone in the sparks of your own kindling, for if you do not place yourself under the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness that they may shine into your heart and expel all selfishness, all worldliness, you cannot be a light to the world. You are not cultivating piety, and a meek and quiet spirit through the grace of Christ. You need to cultivate human sympathy and love. You are too cold. You hold yourself aloof from others, while circumstances and opportunities are granted you every day to represent the character of Jesus. You worry too much.",
