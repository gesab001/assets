    "word": "God has a remnant people in the world--a people who are not following worldly policy. Of them we read in the Scripture, \"The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\" . . . The \n\n\n                                    -54- \n\nChristian world has cast aside the seventh-day Sabbath, and has exalted the false sabbath. But God has a people who will be loyal to Him. His work is to be carried forward. Churches are to be established as memorials of the people who bear His sign. These houses of worship, however humble, will continually proclaim the treason of Satan and the holiness of the Sabbath that was instituted when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy. . . . Satan is presenting worldly attractions. The churches are teaching for doctrine the commandments of men. Ministers are crying, \"There is no law,\" failing to see that if there is no law, there is no transgression. It is time for us to show that we have a message from the Lord, a message of no human invention. Workers who will present the truth in its simplicity are greatly needed. The last message of warning is to be given to the world. As God's people bring the truths of His message into the daily life, practical godliness, purity, and holiness will be seen.--Ms 99, 1902, pp. 1, 7, 10. (\"Fragments,\" typed July 12, 1902.)",
