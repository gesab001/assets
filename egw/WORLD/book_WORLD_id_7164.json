Does he threaten and beat it, or drive it before him, recounting the bitterness and discomfiture and anxiety that he has had on its account? No; he lays the weary, exhausted, wandering sheep on his shoulder, and . . . returns it to the fold. His gratitude finds expression in melodious songs of rejoicing, and heavenly choirs respond to the shepherd's note of joy. . . . For \"joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.\" Jesus says, \"I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine\" (John 10:14). Just as a shepherd of earth knows his sheep, so does the chief Shepherd know His flock that are scattered throughout the whole world. . . . \"And ye, my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God\" (Ezekiel 34:31).",
