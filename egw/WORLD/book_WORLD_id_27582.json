    "word": "I have been deeply impressed that I should write more decidedly to our leading brethren in Battle Creek; for they are in peril, and do not know it. Today when, for the first time, I read in the Review the article by Brother A.T. Jones, and your article in the same paper opposing his position, I could understand more clearly some things that have been urged upon my mind. During my illness I have had precious experiences. Jesus has seemed to be close by me, and again and again I have been in earnest conversation with you. Your dangers have been presented to me. I said to you: \"Elder Smith, the Lord loves you, but you do not discern all things clearly. There are those who are looking to you, influenced by the position you may take; and if you take a position that is not correct, you will lead others to a wrong course of action. We as a people are to reach a very different condition of spiritual life, from that we have yet attained to. All the heavenly intelligences are at work, but the human agencies are slow to cooperate with them in doing the work that is needed to be done in our world. The false ideas that were largely developed at Minneapolis have not been entirely uprooted from some minds. Those who have not made thorough work of repentance under the light God has been pleased to give to his people since that time, will not see things clearly, and will be ready to call the messages God sends a delusion.",
