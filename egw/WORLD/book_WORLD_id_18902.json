    "word": "In His wonderful prayer, Christ said, \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word\" (John 17:20). This takes in all who believe the gospel. \"That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me\" (verse 21). Our unity and love for one another are the credentials by which we testify to the world that God has sent His Son to save sinners.",
