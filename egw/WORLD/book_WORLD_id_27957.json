    "word": "Shall we now let the enemy manage for us? Because the Sanitarium is where it should not be, shall the Word of the Lord be no account? Shall we allow the most intelligent of our youth in the churches throughout our conferences be called to Battle Creek, to become servants to worldlings, to be spoiled and robbed of their simplicity, by being brought in contact with men and women who have not the fear of God in their hearts? Such men and women will come in large numbers to Battle Creek Sanitarium, and a large number of helpers will be needed. Shall those in charge of our conferences allow our youth, who, in the schools away from Battle Creek could be fitted up for the Lord's work, to be drawn to Battle Creek, when for many years the Lord has been calling upon His people to move away from Battle Creek.",
