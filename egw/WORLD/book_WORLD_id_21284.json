    "word": "Small Sanitariums and Treatment Rooms \n\n     Today the truth is to be proclaimed as Christ proclaimed it when He was on this earth. Our people who are collected together at large centers should be out in the field working for souls. They should go to places where the truth has not yet been heard, and pray and plan and work and gain an experience by practical work. Is not Christ in our world today as verily as He was then? Can He not heal the sick \n                                                                           39\nas well now as then? Let small sanitariums and treatment rooms be established, and let people be given an education in the simple methods of treating disease. Those who take up this work will increase in capability; for unseen heavenly agencies will be present to help them. B-43-1905.",
