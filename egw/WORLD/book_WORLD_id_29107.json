    "word": "The Lord has signified that a reform must be made by those who have placed man's human wisdom in the place of the living oracles. Human wisdom is foolishness; for it misses the whole of God's providence, which looks into eternity. \"After that in the Wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\" The Word must be searched, yea, eaten, in order to purify and prepare men to become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. From the first, the schools that are conducted by Seventh-day Adventists should take the Word of God as their lesson book, and in doing this, the teachers and students will find the higher education. In opening the Word of God and searching pages, they will find the hidden treasures. \n\n\n                                       E. G. White \n\n\n                               -132-",
