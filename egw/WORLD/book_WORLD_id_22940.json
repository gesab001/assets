    "word": "Accounted Rich by Heaven \n\n\n     Worldly success, even when obtained at the loss of spiritual life, is often looked upon as the blessing of providence; but it is disaster, it is death. Better far would be poverty, the cross, self-denial, self-sacrifice, and shattered worldly hopes. Better far would be the world's verdict, \"poor,\" than be written poor in the books of heaven. To be written in heaven as one who is rich in spiritual graces is of far greater honor than to sit with princes on earth, and forfeit the kingdom of God. Let it be the ambition of those who profess to believe present truth, to be written as men whose lives are hid with Christ in God, men whom gold cannot buy, who though tempted as was Moses, like him, esteemed the reproaches of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt.",
