    "word": "Chap. 14 - Commercial Versus Denominational Printing\n\n     Witnessing Through Commercial Contacts.--One of the means by which these [publishing] institutions are brought in contact with the world is found in commercial work. [SDA PUBLISHING HOUSES ACCEPTED COMMERCIAL PRINTING CONTRACTS UP UNTIL THE TIME OF THE REVIEW AND HERALD AND PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING ASSOCIATION FIRES IN 1902 AND 1906 RESPECTIVELY. THE EXTRA INCOME THUS PROVIDED ASSISTED THESE PUBLISHING INSTITUTIONS IN OPERATING ON A VIABLE FINANCIAL BASE. BUT THE MISSIONARY MOTIVATION BEHIND SUCH OPERATIONS WAS LARGELY FORGOTTEN. WHEN COMMERCIAL WORK BECAME NEARLY ALL-ABSORBING AND THE PURPOSE SERVED WAS LARGELY MONETARY, GOD SIGNIFIED HIS DISPLEASURE IN THE DISASTROUS FIRES THAT DESTROYED THE CHURCH'S TWO LARGEST PUBLISHING HOUSES. COMMERCIAL WORK STOPPED AFTER THESE DEVASTATING FIRES. THE POLICY REGARDING COMMERCIAL WORK TODAY IS AS FOLLOWS: \"IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PUBLISHING HOUSES EQUIP THEIR INSTITUTIONS WITH THE VIEW OF BUILDING UP DENOMINATIONAL PRINTING AND ELIMINATING ALL COMMERCIAL WORK.\"--GENERAL CONFERENCE PUBLISHING DEPARTMENT POLICIES, 20.] A door is thus opened for the communication of the light of truth.",
