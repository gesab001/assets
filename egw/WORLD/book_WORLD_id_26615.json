    "word": "I have taken one of the very promises so simple that a child can understand it [verse 11], and we are told what kind of asking this is. If we ask, there is a possibility of our having the things promised; is that the way it is put? Is there any hesitancy in this matter? We would think so from the actions of those who ask, but there is no need of it; there is no excuse for one doubt. We receive the things we ask, not because we are good; if you expect to wait until you are good enough to receive the blessing, you will never receive it. If you are going to wait until you are good enough to receive the promise, you will wait until after Christ comes, and it will be too late. You may come just as you are, because He is your Saviour; He died for you; in Him dwelt all the \n\n\n                                     -151- \n\nfullness of the Godhead bodily; and because He has the whole heaven of gift, of light, of power, of blessings, that He may bestow on every one who will seek them and open the door for Jesus to come in. Do you want it enough to open the door? If you will open the door to receive these blessings, there will be an emptying out of the love of the world, of the pride of life, and the vacuum must be supplied by the Holy Spirit just as soon as there will be an emptying of the heart of its idols.",
