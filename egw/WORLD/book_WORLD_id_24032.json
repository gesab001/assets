    "word": "It is our privilege now, in this world, to be workers together with God. But first of all, we must be reconverted. . . . I want that you should clear the King's highway. And do not be afraid of the converting power of God. Be not afraid of His truth coming into the formation of your own individual character. If this work should tear your character to pieces, it can bring it together in a wholeness that is sanctified. We greatly need to humble the soul before God and before Christ Jesus, and so relate ourselves toward our Maker and toward one another, that we shall be brought into unity of action. . . .",
