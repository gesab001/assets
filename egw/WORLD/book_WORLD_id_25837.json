    "word": "I saw the powers of darkness were rising. Satan has come down in great power, knowing that his time is short. Said the angel, as he pointed to Israel, \"Art thou rising? Thou art upon the enchanted ground. Dost thou not see it? Awake and arise and put on the strength of the Lord.\" I was pointed back to the children of Israel in Egypt. I saw [that] when God worked through Moses before Pharaoh, the magicians came up and said they could do the same. I saw the same \n\n\n                                    -130- \n\nwork was now going on in the world and among the professed churches similar to the work of the magicians anciently. I saw the power of the magicians has increased tenfold within a few months, and it will still be on the increase and spread, and unless Israel is rising and increasing in power and strength and is growing in grace and in the knowledge of the truth, the powers of darkness will get the victory over them. I saw we must be constantly rising and keep the ascendancy above the powers of darkness. I saw [that] singing to the glory of God often drove [off] the enemy, and shouting would beat him back and give us the victory. I saw there was too little glorifying God in Israel and too little childlike simplicity.",
