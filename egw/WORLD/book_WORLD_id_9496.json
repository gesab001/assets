    "word": "Depend Constantly on God.-- Many are unable to make definite plans for the future. Their life is unsettled. They cannot discern the outcome of affairs, and this often fills them with anxiety and unrest. Let us remember that the life of God's children in this world is a pilgrim life. We have not wisdom to plan our own lives. It is not for us to shape our future. \"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go \n\n734 \n\nout into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went\" (Hebrews 11:8).",
