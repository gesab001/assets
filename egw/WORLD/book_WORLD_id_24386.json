    "word": "10MR - Manuscript Releases Volume Ten [Nos. 771-850] (1990)\n\n\nA WORD OF EXPLANATION\n\n     WHEN ELLEN WHITE DIED IN 1915, SHE LEFT HER MANUSCRIPTS AND LETTERS IN THE CUSTODY OF A SMALL GROUP OF MINISTERS AND ADMINISTRATORS IN THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH WHOM SHE HAD APPOINTED TO SERVE AS TRUSTEES OF HER ESTATE. AS THE YEARS PASSED, THESE TRUSTEES AND THEIR SUCCESSORS BECAME INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS TO THE CHURCH OF THIS GOLD MINE OF UNPUBLISHED MATERIALS. PROCEDURES WERE DEVELOPED WHEREBY CHURCH ENTITIES, OR EVEN INDIVIDUALS, COULD REQUEST THE \"RELEASE\" OF SPECIFIED EXCERPTS FROM ELLEN WHITE'S WRITINGS FOR USE IN BOOKS, ARTICLES, CLASS LECTURES, OR SERMONS. FOR DETAILS OF THE RELEASE PROCESS THE READER IS REFERRED TO THE PREFACE TO MANUSCRIPT RELEASES, VOL. 1.\n     AS IN THE EARLIER VOLUMES, MATERIALS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE IN PUBLISHED FORM HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME. IN A FEW CASES MATERIALS UNDER CONSIDERATION AND ASSIGNED A RELEASE NUMBER WERE NOT  PROCESSED. AND THE NUMBER WAS NOT REASSIGNED. UNTIL 1983, ONLY THE EXCERPTS REQUESTED FOR PUBLIC USE WERE \"RELEASED.\" STARTING WITH MANUSCRIPT RELEASE NO. 970, THE WHITE ESTATE BEGAN \"RELEASING\" ENTIRE LETTERS OR MANUSCRIPTS, SO FAR AS POSSIBLE, EVEN IF ONLY PARTICULAR PARAGRAPHS WERE REQUESTED.\n     COPY FOR THIS VOLUME HAS BEEN SENT TO THE PUBLISHER CAMERA-READY, WHICH MEANS THAT ANY TYPOGRAPHICAL MISTAKES OR OTHER INACCURACIES WHICH MAY APPEAR ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WHITE ESTATE, NOT THE PUBLISHER.\n     WE TAKE PLEASURE IN MAKING THESE MATERIALS AVAILABLE IN THIS FORM, AND TRUST THAT THE COUNSELS, WARNINGS, AND PRINCIPLES PUT FORTH BY THE AUTHOR WILL BRING A BLESSING TO EVERY READER.\n                                  THE TRUSTEES OF THE ELLEN G. WHITE ESTATE\n                                  WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nA Word of Explanation\n\nMs. Release                                                         Page\n\n        771  Help to Be Given to Foreign Missions . . . . . . . . . 1\n\n        772  Workers Need More of Christ's Refining Grace . . . . . 3\n\n        773  Warning Regarding Future Troubles. . . . . . . . . . . 4\n\n        774  The Whites Hold Tent Meetings in Dallas, Texas . . . . 7\n\n        775  Study of Languages . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n\n        776  Sabbathkeeping in the Arctic . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n\n        777  Salvation Out of and Away From Ourselves . . . . . . . 11\n\n        778  The Writing and Editing of the E.

AT TIMES WORKERS WERE SENT INTO THE FIELD ON THE BASIS THAT HAVING ARRIVED, THEY WOULD BE SELF-SUSTAINING. ARTHUR G. DANIELLS REPORTED THAT HE AND HIS WIFE WERE SENT TO NEW ZEALAND IN 1886, EQUIPPED WITH A TICKET TO THE FIELD AND AN EVANGELISTIC TENT, AND WITH CAUTIONS FROM THE GENERAL CONFERENCE PRESIDENT TO BE CAREFUL IN THE EXPENDITURE OF MEANS. BY GIVING TEMPERANCE LECTURES IN VARIOUS PROTESTANT CHURCHES AT $5 A NIGHT, HE SECURED FUNDS TO GET HIS EVANGELISTIC TENT THROUGH CUSTOMS AND SOON RAISED UP CHURCHES WITH TITHE-PAYING MEMBERS. FROM THIS TITHE, CAREFULLY REPORTED TO PROPER AUTHORITIES, AND WITH LABORERS' REPORTS PROPERLY AUDITED, HE WAS ABLE TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE. IN 1894 ELDER WILLIAM THURSTON WAS SENT TO BRAZIL TO OPEN THE WORK IN RIO DE JANEIRO THROUGH THE SELLING OF BOOKS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT THE RETURNS FROM BOOK SALES WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR HIS FAMILY. IT WAS NO EASY TASK, AS A STRANGER IN A LAND WHERE A LANGUAGE WAS SPOKEN WHICH HE DID NOT KNOW, TO SELL ENGLISH-MESSAGE-FILLED BOOKS TO A PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT READ THEM. IN THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD HE AND HIS FAMILY WERE SUSTAINED AT FIRST BY GIFTS OF MONEY FROM PERFECT STRANGERS. SEE REPORTS IN THE 1901 GENERAL CONFERENCE BULLETIN.",
