    "word": "God designs that His people shall be the light of the world, the salt of the earth. The plan of gathering together in large numbers, to compose a large church, has contracted their influence, and narrowed down their sphere of usefulness, and is literally putting their light under a bushel. [AT THE TIME THIS WAS PUBLISHED, THERE WERE 185 CHURCHES IN NORTH AMERICA, WITH A MEMBERSHIP OF LESS THAN FIVE THOUSAND.] It is God's design that the knowledge of the truth should come to all, that none may remain in darkness, ignorant of its principles; but that all should be tested upon it, and decided for or against it, that all may be warned, and left without excuse. The plan of colonizing, or moving from different localities where there is but little strength or influence, and concentrating the influence of many in one locality, is removing the light from places where God would have it shine.",
