    "word": "I have waited anxiously and hoped that God would put his spirit upon some and use them as instruments of righteousness to awaken and set in order his church. But I have looked in vain. \"Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.\" Notwithstanding all the labor bestowed in years past up to the last June Conference, the church has been steadily and perceptibly retrograding. They have not advanced. They have been uniting more and more with the world in spirit and influence, until the line of demarkation between them and the world is scarcely discernible. They do not bear the image of the heavenly, the impress of the divine. I have about despaired as I have seen, year after year, a greater departure from that simplicity which God has shown me should characterize the life of his followers. There has been less and less interest in, and devotion to, the cause of God. I ask, Wherein have they regarded the warnings given? Wherein have they heeded the instructions they have received? They profess confidence in the testimonies. \n                                                                           71\nWherein have they sought to live according to the light given in them?",
