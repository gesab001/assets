    "word": "Why are we not more wide awake? Each worker may now understand his special work, and receive\n31\nstrength to take hold of it anew. Distinct and peculiar developments of the boundless glory of God will bring tributary offerings of varied kinds to the feet of Jesus. Every new disclosure of the Saviour's love turns the balance for some soul in one direction or the other. The end of all things is at hand. The men of the world are rushing on to their ruin.

Men are heaping up treasures of gold and silver to be consumed by the fires of the last days.",
