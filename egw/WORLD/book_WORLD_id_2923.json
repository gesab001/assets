    "word": "Patterns of Piety \n\n     Seventh-day Adventists, above all other people in the world, should be patterns of piety, holy in heart and in conversation. . . . Should they who make so high a profession indulge in sin and iniquity, their guilt would be very great. . . . Those who do not control their base passions cannot appreciate the atonement or place a right value upon the soul. Salvation is not experienced or understood by them. The gratification of animal passion is the highest ambition of their lives. God will accept nothing but purity and holiness; one spot, one wrinkle, one defect in the character, will forever debar them from heaven, with all its glories and treasures.",
