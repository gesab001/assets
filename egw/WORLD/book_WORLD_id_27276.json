    "word": "April 7, [1889] \n\n     We left Battle Creek for Chicago, accompanied by Sister Fanny Bolton, March 28. We have up to this time, April 7, been having meetings almost continuously. Elder A. T. Jones has labored faithfully to instruct those assembled, and in breaking to their souls the Bread of Life. We have felt sorry that not only every Seventh-day Adventist church but every church, whatever their faith and doctrines, could not have the precious light of truth as it has been so clearly presented. I know it would have been a rich feast to very many souls not of our faith to see the plan of salvation so clearly and simply defined. We must remember that the Lord has very many souls in all the churches throughout the world who are living up to the very best light they have; and could these hungry souls, as well as those of our own faith, have the instructions that have been given here for the last ten days, and their hearts accepted the light and truth of the gospel, they would have been greatly blessed. \n                                                                           281",
