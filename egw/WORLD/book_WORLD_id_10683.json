    "word": "32: Prayer Meeting\n \n\n     The church must pray often.--Jesus prayed! The Majesty of Heaven prayed! He wept in behalf of man. Prayer, faithful, earnest prayer will move the arm that moves the world. The minister of Christ must pray if he would have the refreshing from the presence of God. The church must pray much if they would walk in the light, as He is in the light.--ST Jan. 15, 1880.",
