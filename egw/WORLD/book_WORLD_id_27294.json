    "word": "During the week of prayer in Battle Creek [Dec. 15-22] we labored earnestly, speaking at the sanitarium in the early morning, and at the office chapel to the workers in the office, and at the tabernacle. I had reason to give praise to God that strength was given me for this labor. At times the power of God rested upon me in large measure. It seemed at times while I was speaking that the unseen realities of the eternal world were opened to my view, and I know that the Lord was speaking through me to His people. I take no credit to myself. It was all of God, every bit of it, \n                                                                           366\nand the Spirit of God rested upon the congregation. I was glad of this for the sake of the people, for I knew that those who had been in doubt and evidence for their faith if their hearts were open to receive the impression of the Spirit of God.",
