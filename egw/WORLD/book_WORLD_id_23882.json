    "word": "Let not those who are ministering in word and doctrine be dull of understanding now. The world is being flooded with books and magazines which contain that which will lead the mind astray. I would say to God's people, For Christ's sake do not spend your time in reading that which is a hindrance to spiritual growth. Remember that, spiritually, men and women are built up from the food which they give the mind. The Bible contains the bread sent down from heaven.--Letter 43, 1905, p. 2. (To \"Dear Brethren and Sisters,\" January 29, 1905.)",
