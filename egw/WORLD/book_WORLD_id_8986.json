    "word": "The Lord is calling upon the men and women who have the light of truth for this time to engage in genuine, personal missionary work.

There are great blessings in store for those who fully surrender to the call of God. As such workers undertake to win souls for Jesus, they will find that many who never could be reached in any other way will respond to intelligent personal effort.",
