    "word": "I am pained at heart when I consider how much Christ is dishonored by this disregard of His teachings. The Lord Jesus hath spoken, and in His prayer to His Father presented the result of unity and love of brethren in the impression made upon the unbelieving world. Shall we then repent and be doers of the words of Christ, and cultivate love, true courtesy, and gentleness, giving respect to the Lord's purchased possession, and demonstrating the truthfulness of the words of Christ? John 17:20-24.",
