    "word": "God, Above All Science.--God, the living, personal God, the Author and Ruler of nature, is above all science. He is acquainted with science that is inexplicable to the greatest minds in our world. In His sight the nations before Him are as a drop in the bucket. He taketh up the isles as a very little thing. Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, or the beasts thereof for a burnt offering.",
