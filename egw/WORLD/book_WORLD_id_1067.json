    "word": "The image shown to Nebuchadnezzar [Daniel 2] in the visions of the night represents the kingdoms of the world. The metals in the image, symbolizing the different kingdoms, became less and less pure and valuable. The head of the image was of gold, the breast and arms of silver, the sides of brass, [the legs of iron], and the feet and toes of iron mingled with clay. So the kingdoms represented by them deteriorated in value. . . . If they had kept the fear of the Lord ever before them, they would have been given wisdom and power which would have bound them together and kept them strong.\u2014Manuscript 39, 1899 (see also Review and Herald, Feb. 6, 1900).",
