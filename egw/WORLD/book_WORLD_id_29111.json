    "word": "We are laborers together with God. Believest thou this? The knowledge, the capabilities, the powers, God has given us are not to be hoarded as men hoard riches. We are not to do as the selfish money-loving men of this age are doing. The passion to accumulate their possessions and retain their power has grown upon the men of the world. In their selfishness they buy up wheat and goods so that others in their need will have to buy them; then they charge whatever prices they desire. This is the spirit that is prevailing in the world, and is making the money-hoarder Satan's co-partner in robbing the poor. This is keenly felt by the poorer classes, and the devil leads them to do his will in stubbornly resisting the things they can not help. Thus selfishness and violence are exercised by man over his fellowman. The ones who are robbed and injured become exasperated, and violence and wickedness and cruelty are created in the world.",
