I spoke to them in regard to the short work to be done in the earth, and our need of keeping before the world the evidences that the Lord is in our midst. This evidence may be given in words of praise and thanksgiving. Whoso offereth praise glorifieth God.\" The Lord calls for faithful witnesses. With our lips and in our works, we should praise Him. As a people \n\n\n                              -462- \n\nwe have received special advantages from the Lord, but we do not render to Him sincere thanksgiving. Daily His praise should be spoken by every one of us.",
