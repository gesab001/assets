    "word": "A wonderful responsibility rests upon those connected with the sanitariums established in His name for the treatment of (345) the sick. This is to be done without the use of poisonous drugs. Those who become workers in the sanitariums are to believe the words of Christ, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Those who have the fear of God in the heart will cultivate a sweet disposition. Forbearance and courtesy will be manifested in the life. Duties will be faithfully discharged and in a way that will not leave a disagreeable impression on the minds of the sick or the well.",
