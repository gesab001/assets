    "word": "In all ages God has given human beings divine revelations, that thus He may fulfill His purpose of unfolding gradually to the mind the doctrines of grace. His manner of imparting the truth is illustrated by the words, \"His going forth is prepared as the morning.\" He who places himself where God can enlighten him, advances, as it were, from the partial obscurity of dawn to the full radiance of noonday.... As the sun goes forth upon its errand of mercy and love, as the golden beams of the day flood the canopy of heaven, and beautify forest and mountain, awakening the world by dispelling the darkness of night, so the followers of Christ should go forth upon their mission of love.",
