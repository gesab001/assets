    "word": "My brethren and sisters, there will come into your city many who have never heard the truth for this time. These men and women may come from cities which through your neglect have never been warned. As they come to where you are, neglect not your duty. By wise, Christlike movements, disappoint the enemy. Now is your opportunity, just now, to tell them of what is coming upon the world. In great wisdom present the truth as it is in Jesus.",
