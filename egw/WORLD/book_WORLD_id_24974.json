    "word": "Let not the church, by binding up her interests in a few places, refuse to obey the command of Christ. Thus she draws away from Him who gave His life for the life of the world. The Saviour desires His cause to make proportionate advancement in the various openings made by the proclamation of the truth. He does not direct men to make extravagant expenditures in a few spots, multiplying the advantages there while other places remain barren and unworked. By such misappropriation of means the work in foreign fields is hindered. The way is not prepared for Christ.",
