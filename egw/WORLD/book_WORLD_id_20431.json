    "word": "But that cross, that instrument of shame and torture, brought hope and salvation to the world. The believers rallied; their hopelessness and conscious helplessness had left them. They were transformed in character, and united in the bonds of Christian love.

Without earthly honor or recognition, they were heroes of faith. From their lips came words of divine eloquence and power that shook the world.",
