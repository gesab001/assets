We have long desired to see sanitarium work established in this place, not that we ourselves may be benefited, but that those who have never heard the truth may have an opportunity of hearing the last message of mercy to be given to the world. If you have known and enjoyed the comfort of the Holy Spirit, the assurance of the grace of God, the hope of the gospel of Christ, your heart must be drawn out in earnest longing that this work may extend rapidly, while mercy's sweet voice is still heard inviting perishing souls to come to the Saviour.",
