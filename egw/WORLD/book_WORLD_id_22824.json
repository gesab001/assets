Jesus loves the little ones, and He is watching to see how parents are doing their work. . . . In whatever else we may fail, let us be thorough in the work for our children. If they go forth from the home training pure and virtuous, if they fill the least and lowest place in God's great plan of good for the world, our life-work can never be called a failure.\"--C. Ed., pp. 174, 175. (See also Chr. Temp., pp. 60-72.)",
