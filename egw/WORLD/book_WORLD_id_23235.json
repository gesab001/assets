    "word": "What can be compared with the loss of a human soul? It is a question which every soul must determine for himself--whether to gain the treasures of eternal life or to lose all because of his neglect to make God and His righteousness his first and only business. Jesus, the world's Redeemer, who gave His own precious life that every son and daughter of Adam might have life--eternal life--in the kingdom of God, looks with grief upon the large number of those who profess to be Christians, who are not serving Him but themselves. They scarcely think of eternal realities, notwithstanding He calls their attention to the rich reward awaiting the faithful who will serve Him with their undivided affections. He brings eternal realities within the range of their vision. He bids them to count the cost now of being an obedient and faithful follower of Christ, and says, \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\"",
