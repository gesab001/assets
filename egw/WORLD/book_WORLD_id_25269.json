    "word": "\"Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem\" [Luke 24:46, 47]. The power of God was to go with those who proclaimed the gospel. If those who claim to have a living experience in the things of God had done their appointed work as the Lord ordained, the whole world would have been warned, and the Lord Jesus would have come to our world with power and great glory.--Letter 84, 1894, pp. 7-9.
