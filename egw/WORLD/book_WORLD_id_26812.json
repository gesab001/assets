    "word": "The trouble with many is [that] they have lost sight of Jesus. [They] fail to see the self-denial and love and mercy in His character, and therefore they do not imitate His life. But Jesus wants us to be one with Him, as He was one with the Father, and He wants us to be united one with another. We want to show to the world that we have a faith that is elevating, that makes us kind, courteous, self-denying, and begets in us love and reverence for God, and makes us Christian ladies and gentlemen.",
