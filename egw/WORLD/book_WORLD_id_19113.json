    "word": "Justice, honor, love, and truth are the attributes of God's throne. They are the principles of His government which is to be established on the earth, made pure by the fire of His retributive justice. These are the jewels to be sought after and cherished for time and for eternity. In view of these things, . . . build your character not after the worldly standard, but for eternity.--Letter 41, Dec. 7, 1877, to F. E. Belden, a 19-year-old nephew.",
