    "word": "There is one thing I would urge upon you and your associates, and that is, that it is a most solemn thing to represent to the world the character of Christ. Wherever this is done, by whoever it is done, there is seed sown unto eternal life. Whatever you may see others doing that your judgment convicts you as being unseemly for a Christian, see to it that you never do the same things yourself. Never grieve the heart of Jesus, who has borne your sins and carried your sorrows.",
