    "word": "We are finite, but we are to have a sense of the infinite. The mind must be brought into exercise in contemplating God and his wonderful plan for our salvation. The soul will thus be lifted above the mere earthly and common-place, and fixed upon that which is ennobling and eternal. The thought that we are in God's world, in the presence of the great Creator of the universe, who made man after his own likeness, will lead the mind into broad, exalted fields for meditation. The thought that God's eye is watching over us, that he loves us, and cared so much for us as to give his dearly beloved Son to redeem us, that we might not miserably perish, is a great one; and he who opens his heart to the acceptance \n126\nand contemplation of themes like these, will never be satisfied with trivial, sensational subjects.",
