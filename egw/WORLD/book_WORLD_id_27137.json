    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has taken the position before those not of our faith that the Battle Creek Sanitarium is undenominational, and has thus placed our work in a false light. He made indistinct the line of demarcation between worldlings and those who hold in trust the most solemn truth ever given to mortals. Thus God has been greatly dishonored. The truth that has made us what we are is the same as it always has been. We must now more distinctly define the medical missionary work. As John the Baptist prepared the way for Christ's first coming, so we are to prepare the way for His second coming.",
