    "word": "Often the very best men, those whom God uses to His name's glory, are unrecognized by human wisdom, but not for one moment are they forgotten by God.

The world and the bigoted priests and rulers rejoiced that they were at last rid of his ever fresh testimony. [1 John 1:1-3, quoted].",
