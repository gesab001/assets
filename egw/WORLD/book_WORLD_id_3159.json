    "word": "How Inconsistent! How Worthless! \n\n     Christ declares, \"He that will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Those who have on the wedding garment, the robe of Christ's righteousness, will not question whether they should lift the cross, and follow in the footsteps of the Saviour. Willingly and cheerfully they will obey His commands. Souls are perishing out of Christ. How inconsistent, then, is all striving after position and wealth. How feeble are the motives which Satan may present, which selfishness and ambition can furnish, in comparison with the lessons which Christ has given in His word! How worthless the reward the world offers beside that offered by our heavenly Father!-- R. & H., Sept. 19, 1899.",
