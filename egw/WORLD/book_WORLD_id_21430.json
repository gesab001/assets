    "word": "The very first and most important thing is to melt and subdue the soul by presenting our Lord Jesus Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour. Never should a sermon be preached, or Bible instruction in any line be given, without pointing the hearers to \"The Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" John 1:29. We are to proclaim to the people Christ and His love, presenting all our doctrines in their relation to this important theme. Every true doctrine makes Christ the centre, every precept receives force from his word.",
