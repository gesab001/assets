    "word": "MR No. 1543 - 1880 Camp Meeting at Milton, Oregon\n\n     (Written May 20, 1880, from the campground at Milton, Oregon, to James White. Most of this letter appears in Manuscript Releases, vol. 7, pp. 28-35.) \n\n\n     Above two weeks and no letters from anyone. We seem to be shut out from the world. Not a line has come from anyone except a deed from Battle Creek for me to sign. One word from Brother Kellogg, stating that Brother White was setting out hedge and had bought back our place of Bow; that is all.",
