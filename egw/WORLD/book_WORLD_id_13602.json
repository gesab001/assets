    "word": "The cross of Christ,--how many believe it to be what it is? How many bring it into their studies, and know its true significance? There could not be a Christian in our world without the cross of Christ. . . . Turn from the examples of the world, cease to extol the professedly great men; turn the mind from the glory of everything save the cross of Christ. Said Paul, \"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Let all, from the highest to the lowest, understand what it means to glory in the cross of Christ. That cross is to be bravely and manfully borne. Christ declares, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\" And to all who will lift it, and bear it after Christ, the cross is a pledge of the crown of glory that can never fade away. . . .",
