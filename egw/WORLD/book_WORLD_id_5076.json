    "word": "Those who boast of wisdom beyond the teaching of the word of God, need to drink deeper of the fountain of knowledge, that they may learn their real ignorance. There is a boasted wisdom of men, that is foolishness in the sight of God. \"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that \n                                                                           131\nhe may be wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.\" Those who have only this wisdom, need to become fools in their own estimation. The greatest ignorance that now curses the human race is in regard to the binding claims of the law of God; and this ignorance is the result of neglecting the study of the word of God. It is Satan's determined plan to so engage and absorb the mind, that God's great guidebook shall not be the Book of books, and that the sinner may not be led from the path of transgression to the path of obedience.",
