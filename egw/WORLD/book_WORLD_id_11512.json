    "word": "God has a standard of righteousness by which He measures character. This standard is His holy law, which is given to us as a rule of life. We are called upon to comply with its requirements, and when we do this we honor both God and Jesus Christ; for God gave the law, and Christ died to magnify it, and make it honorable. He declares: \"If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\" ... \"The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.\"",
