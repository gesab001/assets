    "word": "Chap. 7 - Self-Denying Service\n[EXTRACT FROM LETTER\nWRITTEN NOVEMBER 1, 1905, TO THE MANAGER\nOF A SANITARIUM, EARLY IN THE HISTORY OF\nTHE INSTITUTION.]\n\n     From Jesus is our life derived. In Him is life that is original,--unborrowed, underived life. In us there is a streamlet from the fountain of life. In Him is the fountain of life. Our life is something that we receive, something that the Giver takes back again to Himself. If our life is hid with Christ in God, we shall, when Christ shall appear, also appear with Him in glory. And while in this world, we will give to God, in sanctified service, all the capabilities He has given us. . . .",
