    "word": "The world hides a man from himself. It conceals from him his dangers by shutting out the prospect of a future life, and by constantly appealing to his human senses. By thus keeping in his mind only the interests of this life, it seeks to make him a creature of time. But fixing his eyes upon the eternal world, man sees the cross of Christ and the death of the Son of God to save a perishing world.",
