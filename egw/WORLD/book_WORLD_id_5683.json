    "word": "Warning, admonition, promise, all are for us, upon whom the ends of the world are come. \"Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober\" (1 Thessalonians 5:6). . . . Watch against the stealthy approach of the enemy, watch against old habits and natural inclinations, lest they assert themselves; force them back, and watch. Watch the thoughts, watch the plans, lest they become self-centered. Watch over the souls whom Christ has purchased with His own blood. Watch for opportunities to do them good.",
