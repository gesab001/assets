    "word": "The Lord calls for a reformation. In every place where believers have adopted worldly principles, He desires a voice of warning to be raised. \"Cry aloud,\" He says, \"spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins\" (Isaiah 58:1). As a people and as individuals we must put away the erroneous principles and ambitious projects which lead us to embrace so much within a narrow compass. God desires us to learn to walk firmly and solidly, ever advancing in His way. He desires us to erect every building with reference to the needs of other places that must sometime have similar advantages.",
