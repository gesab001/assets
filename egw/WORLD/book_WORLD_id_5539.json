    "word": "Christ is called \"the Lord our righteousness,\" and through faith each one should say, \"The Lord my righteousness.\" When faith lays hold upon this gift of God, the praise of God will be upon our lips, and we shall be able to say to others, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). We shall then be able to tell the lost concerning the plan of salvation, that while the world was lying under the curse of sin, the Lord presented terms of mercy to the fallen and hopeless sinner, and revealed the value and meaning of His grace. Grace is unmerited favor. . . . It was grace that sent our Saviour to seek us as wanderers and bring us back to the fold. . . .",
