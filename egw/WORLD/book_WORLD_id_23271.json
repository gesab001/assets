    "word": "Here is the admonition, \"Come. . .and learn of me.\" How difficult to enter the school of Christ by giving up our wills, and submitting to the will of our heavenly Father! Christ knows our weakness. He has given us promises to encourage us by the way, and is ever ready to bear our burdens for us if we will bring them to Him. In Christ is all fullness and the Father has acknowledged Him as His Son and at His baptism the words were heard from heaven, \"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" Through Christ we can gain access to the Father. The door of heaven is ajar, \n\n\n                                      -73- \n\nand light will come to us as it did to Jesus Christ, and we can be lights to the world. We must learn humility. When this lesson is fully learned the yoke will rest easily upon us.",
