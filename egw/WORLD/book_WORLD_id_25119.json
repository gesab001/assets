    "word": "MR No. 1150 - Speculation in Lands and Mines\n\n            (Written January 7, 1890, at Battle Creek, Michigan.) \n\n     Dealing in mining stocks is a snare to any of our brethren who invest in them. And buying and selling city lots, selling the lots at figures far above their real value, is another species of robbery. It is not lawful business. It may meet the world's standard, but it cannot meet the standard of an impartial God. These are Satan's traps, laid to catch souls. Our safeguard in all business transactions is the love and fear of God.",
