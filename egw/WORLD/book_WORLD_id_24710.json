    "word": "Gospel of Christ to Be Practiced--God says, \"A new heart will I give you.\" Every learner may be renewed in knowledge and true holiness. The ransom of an enslaved race was Christ's purpose in coming to this earth. What a pity it is that human beings cannot discern their own weakness. What a pity that they enslave their souls by lifting themselves up unto vanity. Christ alone can make us free. And when He makes us free, we are free indeed. His power breaks the yoke of bondage that binds man to the great deceiver, the originator of sin. But how many there are who are unwilling to allow Christ to break their shackles. How many there are who choose to cling to the thraldom of sin. The gospel of Christ is truly believed only when it is practiced. Faith is justified by works. Self must be hid; Christ must appear as the chiefest among ten thousand, the One altogether lovely. When an unreserved surrender of the powers of body, mind, and soul is made to the Saviour, self no longer strives for the mastery. What man needs today is the crucifixion of self and the revelation in his life of Christ, the hope of glory. Then will be fulfilled the word, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" Then will be answered the prayer, \"That they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us\" (John 17:21). In thought, word, and action, Christ's followers will be an exemplification of godliness. An atmosphere of peace will surround them. \n\n\n                                    -147-",
