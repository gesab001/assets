    "word": "Turn not from Message-Filled Books \n\n\n     My heart aches as I see those who profess to be looking for Christ's coming devoting their time and talents to circulating books that contain nothing concerning the special truth for our time--books of narrative, books of biography, books of men's theories and speculations. The world is full of such books; they can be had anywhere; but can the followers of Christ engage in so common a work, when there is crying need for God's truth on every hand? It is not our mission to circulate such works. There are thousands of others to do this, who have as yet no knowledge of anything better. We have a definite mission, and we ought not to turn from it for side issues, employing men and means to bring to the attention of the people books that have no bearing upon the present truth.
