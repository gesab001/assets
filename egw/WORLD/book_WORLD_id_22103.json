    "word": "PH070 - The Selection of Articles for our Papers (1899)\n\n\n       The Selection of Articles for our Papers\n\n     Our power and efficiency as Seventh-day Adventists is largely dependent on the literature which comes from our presses. An indiscriminate class of articles should not be published in our periodicals. Cheap, worthless stories should find no place in them. There are articles of romance and fiction which contain no seeds that will bear good fruit. I would say to our editors, Be careful in the selection of the matter which is to go to the world. Show the greatest caution and discernment. Be careful that the Review and Herald, and the Signs of the Times are kept free from worthless matter. Precious matter from what has already been printed can be found for our papers.",
