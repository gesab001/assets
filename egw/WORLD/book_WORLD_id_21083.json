    "word": "The field is the world. Christ declares, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" My brethren, you would increase your pleasure in the Lord if you would practise self-denial. If you would resolve to love God truly and keep His commandments, you would discern the duties that devolve upon you as laborers together with God. You would willingly bring Him your offerings. You would faithfully and joyfully tithe your income, that His work in home and foreign fields might be advanced. The truth would go forth from your lips in no feigned words. Your zeal and piety would be greatly increased, and the unbelieving world would see that you have been in communion with God, and have learned of Him.",
