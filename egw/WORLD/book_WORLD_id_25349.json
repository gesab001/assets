    "word": "What mental anguish Christ passed through! What grief! What torture of mind! He was face to face not with a hideous monster, as is represented with bat's wings and cloven feet, but a beautiful angel of light, apparently just from the presence of God. His deceiving power was so great that a third of the heavenly angels were induced to believe him to be right and unite with him against God and His Son Jesus Christ. And now Satan's personal contact in this world with Christ was of a most determined character, for if he succeeded here in his strong and wily efforts he was conqueror and the prince of the world. He knew that all his claims to the kingdoms of the world were false and could not be sustained unless he should overcome Christ.",
