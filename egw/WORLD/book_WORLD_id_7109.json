    "word": "Those who here acknowledge God as their ruler, by obeying the laws of his government, will be accounted worthy of a place in his family in heaven; for they have proved that they will reverence him and obey his will in the future life. When the final hour of trial comes, God will send his angels to guard them. When the voice that once shook the earth shall shake not only the earth but also heaven, then the voice of our Lord will be heard saying, \u201cCome, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\u201d They will see him as he is; they will escape those things that are coming upon the earth, and will stand within the heavenly courts; for Christ has promised, \u201cBlessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\u201d",
