    "word": "There is nothing that will give a man a knowledge of the value of his entrusted capabilities as the conviction that he is a laborer together with God, reflecting to the world the light of truth which the Lord has given him. Christ expects us individually to do the work which, when He ascended to the Father, He left in the hands of His believing disciples. We are to reveal to the world that which God has seen necessary to reveal to us. We are not doing the will of our heavenly Father when we speculate upon things which He has seen fit to withhold from us. It is the privilege of everyone to reveal to others that he appreciates the worth of divine truths, that he appreciates the treasures of eternal life, by making every sacrifice to obtain the reward.",
