    "word": "The rainbow of promise encircling the throne on high is an everlasting testimony that \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). It testifies to the universe that God will never forsake His people in their struggle with evil. It is an assurance to us of strength and protection as long as the throne itself shall endure.",
