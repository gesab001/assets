When it is received into the heart, the whole character is changed. \u201cIf any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\u201d [2 Corinthians 5:17.] Old habits and customs and national pride and prejudice are broken down. \u201cThe fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\u201d [Galatians 5:22, 23.] When these are abiding in the soul, there will be unity of thought and action.",
