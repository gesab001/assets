    "word": "\"For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread. . . . To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\" The world is not to be our criterion. Let the Lord work, let the Lord's voice be heard.",
