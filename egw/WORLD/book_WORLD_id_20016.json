    "word": "\"For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings\" (Hebrews 2:10). He had to understand all about the weakness of man, the strength of Satan's temptations. He took humanity right upon Himself, and bore all the temptations of the devil, and He knows what every man has to endure. Consider Christ's pity for man. He knows just how they were born. He knows just how they were surrounded in childhood. You don't know what temptations came with their birth. You don't know the conditions of their parents. Put away all judgment. Judgment belongs to the Son of God. He is the One who is to judge the world.--Manuscript 174, Nov. 14, 1901, \"Morning Lesson From Hebrews Two.\"",
