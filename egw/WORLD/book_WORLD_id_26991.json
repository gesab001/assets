    "word": "To the fathers and mothers before me I would say, Educate your children for the future, immortal life. Educate them to see the beauty there is in a life of holiness. Bring them to the foot of the cross. Try to teach them what it means to believe in Jesus--that it is to accept Him as our dearest Friend. Help them to understand that He took upon Himself the nature of humanity, in order that He might stand at the head of humanity and become acquainted with all our trials and afflictions. He could have surrounded Himself with angels of glory, but no, He condescended to be made like unto His brethren. He was not born as a prince in this world, but was of humble parentage. He understands the trials of the poor. He knows all about the temptations we meet in daily life. We may safely put our trust in Him.",
