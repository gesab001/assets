    "word": "We are now living in the last days, when the truth must be spoken, when in reproof and warning it must be given to the world, irrespective of consequences. If there are some who will become offended and turn from the truth, we must bear in mind that there were those who did the same in Christ's day. When the greatest Teacher the world has ever known spoke the truth, many of His disciples became offended and walked no more with Him.",
