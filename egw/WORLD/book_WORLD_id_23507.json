    "word": "Who can approach unto a conception of what Christ has endured when standing in the place of surety for His church in the solemn hour of atonement, when Christ yielded up His life as a sacrificial offering. Never, never, can it be that God again shall so manifest His holiness, His spotless purity. . . . His utter hatred of sin, His solemn purpose to punish it--and [all] that in the only One who could bear the strokes in behalf of the sinner, and because of His innocence not be consumed. How did the glory of God magnify itself in glorious perfection on that day when Christ's life was yielded up as a sacrifice for the world! When He cried out, \"It is finished,\" there was a mighty earthquake, the rocks rent, the graves flew open, and Christ bowed His head and died.--Ms 6, 1897, p. 2, 3.
