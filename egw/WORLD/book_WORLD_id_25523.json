    "word": "Ambition in the disciples of Christ, and thirst to be highest, make them represent the men of the world. They are sure to lose Christ out of their hearts and they [are sure to] find disappointment following disappointment. Many in this world who are first in privileges and count themselves in many respects talented above others, will in the future great test find themselves far below the humble, meek, and lowly ones. God's estimate is accurate. Man's measurement is deceiving. Humility and the disposition to serve God by serving others are the true marks of Christlikeness, and they will be truly honored in the kingdom of God.",
