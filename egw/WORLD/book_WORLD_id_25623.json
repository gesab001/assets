    "word": "Could one sin have been found in Christ, the world would have been plunged into blackness and ruin. If Satan could have so bruised Christ's heel that He would have yielded to the physical torture, his triumph would have been complete. He could have shouted victory. The world would have been his kingdom. But Satan could only cause pain. He could not touch Christ's head unless Christ proved false to God.",
