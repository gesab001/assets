    "word": "The world's Redeemer did not come with outward display, or a show of worldly wisdom. Men could not see, beneath the guise of humanity, the glory of the Son of God. He was \"despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\" He was to them as \"a root out of a dry ground,\" with \"no form nor comeliness,\" [Isaiah 53:3, 2.] that they should desire Him. But He declared, \"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the Lord hath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent Me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.\" [Isaiah 61:1.]",
