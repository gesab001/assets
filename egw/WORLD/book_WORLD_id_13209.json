    "word": "(Romans 3:19; 7:12; Jude 15.) All the Worlds Witness Judgment.--Christ would have all understand the events of His second appearing. The judgment scene will take place in the presence of all the worlds; for in this judgment the government of God will be vindicated, and His law will stand forth as \"holy, and just, and good.\" Then every case will be decided, and sentence will be passed upon all. Sin will not then appear attractive, but will be seen in all its hideous magnitude. All will see the relation in which they stand to God and to one another (RH Sept. 20, 1898).",
