    "word": "The Glory of the Gospel. \n\n     It is the glory of the gospel that it is founded upon the principle of restoring in the fallen race the divine image by a constant manifestation of benevolence. This work began in the heavenly courts. There God decided to give human beings an unmistakable evidence of the love with which He regarded them. He \"so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
