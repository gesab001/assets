    "word": "I have said over and over again that there must be unity between the gospel ministry and the medical missionary work. If you and your associates draw off to do the work that you have been doing, I shall be compelled to publish the warnings that the Lord has been giving you for the past twenty years. The people in our \n\n\n                         -116- \n\nconferences have not seen these warnings. But if this can be avoided by our blending together, much mis-interpretation and mis-understanding will be saved. I have been charged that unless some change is made, I must publish these warnings to save the people of God from being led into strange and forbidden paths. I do not desire that this matter shall come before the world. By coming into line as you propose, you can save this.",
