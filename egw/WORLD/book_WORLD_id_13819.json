    "word": "This parable describes the growth of the plant from the seed. When the seed falls into the good ground, it soon germinates, and in time brings forth fruit. But there is a gradual process of development. It is \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" Jesus, who gave this parable, created the tiny seed, gave it its vital properties, and ordained the laws that govern its growth; and he has made it a living illustration of truth in both the natural and the spiritual world.",
