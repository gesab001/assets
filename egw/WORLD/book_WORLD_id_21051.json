    "word": "Chap. 3 - The Establishment of Memorials at\nWashington, D. C.\n\n     I have written much in regard to the need of making decided efforts in Washington, D.C. An important work is to be done in this city. If there is any place in the world where the truth should be fully presented, it is in the city that is the very heart of the nation. Those who act a prominent part in framing laws for the nation should understand what is written in the law of God, which lies at the foundation of all right laws.",
