    "word": "God is seeking to exalt us to His high, pure, heavenly standard. For this purpose His Spirit is constantly striving with us. The corruptions of the world and all unholy influences will be working through the masterly energies of Satan to drag men down to their level, blinding their sensibilities, degrading their desires, enfeebling the conscience, and in every way making their religious faculties weak and inefficient. Our natural tendencies, unless corrected by the Holy Spirit of God, have in them the seeds of moral death. The flesh with all its prompting \"lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh\" (Galatians 5:17). If the higher, holier attributes are not cultivated, if we allow ourselves to deceive, to prevaricate, there is a false tongue that needs to be treated with the hot \"coals of juniper\" (Psalm 120:4). . . .",
