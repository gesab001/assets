    "word": "\"There has been an abundance of slipshod work done. The only conclusion that the world can come to is that those who profess to believe that the end of all things is at hand, do not really believe the tremendous truth that Christ is at the door. Do they believe the mission of Christ was to save the lost and perishing; that Christ is the only remedy for sin; that the world's Redeemer came to the world all seared and marred with the curse to lift up fallen man, to reveal to the perishing the love of the Father, and bring them to look and live, and thereby bring many sons and daughters to glory. . . .",
