    "word": "God does not consult our opinions or preferences. He knows what human beings do not know--the future results of every movement--and therefore our eyes should be directed to Him and not to the worldly advantages presented by Satan. Satan tells us that if we give heed to him we shall reach great heights of knowledge. \"Ye shall be as gods,\" he said to Eve, \"if you eat of the tree forbidden by God.\" The test given to Adam and Eve was very light, but they could not bear it. They disobeyed God, and this transgression opened the floodgates of woe on our world.",
