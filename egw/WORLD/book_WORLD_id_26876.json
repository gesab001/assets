    "word": "If Jesus abides in you, it is to some purpose. You cannot then enjoy light and trifling conversation. Said Isaiah, I am a man of unclean lips. And how true this is of many who profess to be Christians. If you talk as any worldling talks and act as any worldling acts, you dishonor the Christ you profess to love. You need to be converted daily, to honor Christ by every word. Be ye holy in all manner of conversation. When you sit at the table, you are to eat, giving thanks to God, of the very best foods for making the best blood and the clearest intellect. We want sharp-thinking men and women.",
