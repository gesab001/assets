    "word": "Oh, when I think what the church in Battle Creek might be if they were only Christians, what good influences they might exert if they only followed the Lord Jesus fully, I am bowed to the earth with a weight of sorrow I cannot express, because I know that the large number who expend all their earnings in dress, in attending concerts, in administering to their own pleasure, are not Christians. They have not the mark of God's people. They have not the meekness and lowliness of Christ, thus cannot shine as lights in the world. They conform to the world, and their influence is of the same character as that of the world.",
