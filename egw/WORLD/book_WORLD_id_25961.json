    "word": "We have a work to do that we have not done. Our faith is to be broader, deeper, more trustful than it has been. We are to bring all our necessities to Christ, knowing that He will supply our need. Since one soul is of more value in God's sight than the whole world, let us act as genuine medical missionaries. Christ has given us our work. The deeper our appreciation of His love, the keener will be our sense of need, and the stronger our faith. And we shall receive according to our faith.",
