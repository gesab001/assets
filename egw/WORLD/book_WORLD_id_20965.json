    "word": "Shall we enter into confederacy with the world because some of our brethren in their spiritual blindness are linking up with unbelievers, and because men who are known to be transgressors of God's law are given a place as counselors in regard to the working of the institutions that were established for the express purpose of proclaiming to the world the last message of mercy?--God forbid. Can we not see what is coming \n                                                                           47\nupon the world? Shall we allow ambitious projects to take the throne?--Never, never. We are not to bind up with those who have no faith in the truth for this time.",
