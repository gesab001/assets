    "word": "I saw that some professed Sabbath-keepers spent hours that were worse than thrown away studying this or that fashion to decorate the poor, mortal body. While you make yourselves appear like the world, and as beautiful as you can, remember that the same body may in a few days be food for worms. And while you fix it up to your taste to please the eye, you are dying spiritually. God hates your vain, wicked pride, and he looks upon you as a whited sepulcher; but within full of corruption and uncleanness.",
