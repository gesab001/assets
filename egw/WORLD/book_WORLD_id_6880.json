    "word": "\u201cArise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\u201d Isaiah 60:1. To those who go out to meet the Bridegroom is this message given. Christ is coming with power and great glory. He is coming with His own glory and with the glory of the Father. He is coming with all the holy angels with Him. While all the world is plunged in darkness, there will be light in every dwelling\n34\nof the saints. They will catch the first light of His second appearing. The unsullied light will shine from His splendor, and Christ the Redeemer will be admired by all who have served Him. While the wicked flee from His presence, Christ\u2019s followers will rejoice. The patriarch Job, looking down to the time of Christ\u2019s second advent, said, \u201cWhom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not a stranger.\u201d Job 19:27, margin.",
