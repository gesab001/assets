    "word": "This practical instruction in religious experience is what Christian parents should be prepared to give their children. God requires this of you, and you neglect your duty if you fail to perform this work. Instruct your children in regard to God's chosen methods of discipline and the conditions of success in the Christian life. Teach them that they cannot serve God and have their minds absorbed in over-careful provision for this life; but do not let them cherish the thought that they have no need to toil and may spend their leisure moments in idleness. God's word is plain on this point. Jesus, the Majesty of Heaven, has left an example for the youth. He toiled in the workshop at Nazareth for his daily bread. He was subject to his parents, and sought not to control his own time or to follow his own will. By a life of easy indulgence a youth can never attain to real excellence as a man or as a Christian. God does not promise us ease, honor, or wealth in his service, but he assures us that all needed blessings will be ours, \"with persecutions,\" and in the world to come \"life everlasting.\" Nothing less than entire consecration to his service will Christ accept. This is the lesson which every one of us must learn.",
