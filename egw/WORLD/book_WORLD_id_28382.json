    "word": "(727) We are not willing enough to trouble the Lord, and to ask Him for the gifts of the Holy Spirit. And the Lord wants us to trouble Him in this matter. He wants us to press our petitions to the throne. The most valuable education that can be obtained will be found in going out with the message of truth to the places that are in darkness, just as the first disciples went out in obedience to the commission of Christ. The Saviour gave the disciples their directions in a few words. He told them what they might expect. \"I send you forth,\" He said, \"as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\" These workers were to go forth as the representatives of Him who gave life for the life of the world.",
