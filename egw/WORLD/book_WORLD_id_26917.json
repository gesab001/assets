    "word": "\"I beseech you therefore, . . . by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice\" [Romans 12:1]. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's\" [1 Corinthians 6:19, 20]. When this is done, we shall expect to see every promise of God fulfilled. \"And be \n\n\n               -139- \n\nnot conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God\" [Romans 12:2]. If we walk in the footsteps of Jesus, we shall be an obedient people, because we shall keep the windows of the soul opened heavenward. Thus we may have the light, the peace, the joy of heaven.",
