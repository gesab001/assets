    "word": "The Need in Our Camp-Meetings. \n\n     If the man who feels himself called of God to be a minister, will abase himself and learn of Christ, he will become a true teacher. This is what we need in our camp-meetings--a ministry vivified with the Holy Ghost. There must be less sermonizing, and more tact to educate the people in practical religion. The people must be impressed with the fact that Jesus is salvation to all who believe in him. \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" There are grand themes on which the gospel minister may dwell. Jesus has said, \"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.\"",
