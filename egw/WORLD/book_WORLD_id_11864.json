    "word": "After children grow to years of maturity, some of them think their duty is done in providing an abode for their parents.  While giving them food and shelter, they give them no love or sympathy.  In their parents' old age, when they long for expression of affection and sympathy, children heartlessly deprive them of their attention.  There is no time when children should withhold respect and love from their father and mother. While the parents live, it should be the children's joy to honor and respect them.  They should bring all the cheerfulness and sunshine into the life of the aged parents that they possibly can.  They should smooth their pathway to the grave.  There is no better recommendation in this world than that a child has honored his parents, no better record in the books of heaven than that he has loved and honored father and mother.",
