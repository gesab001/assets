    "word": "There is no peace to be obtained in uniting our interest with the world, whom Christ says cannot receive the truth because they know not the Father or the Son Jesus Christ. Jesus says, \"If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.\" John 15:18, 19. Jesus was drawing the world but they refused to come to Jesus, refused to know Him. \"Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my sayings, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.\" John 15:20, 21.",
