    "word": "The Jews were a proud people, boasting of piety, of knowledge, of goodness, but revealing no fruit. If they had set before the world an example of fruitbearing in deeds of self-denial, goodness, mercy, and compassion, if they had shown a love for God and integrity in His service, by obeying all His commandments, the world would have seen their light shining in good work, and many would have been converted. Many would have glorified God for His great love and His rich blessings bestowed upon them through their knowledge of the only true God and their faith in Jesus Christ. The darkness of the Gentile world was attributable to the neglect of the Jewish nation, as is represented in the ninth chapter of Zechariah. [Zechariah 9:12-17, quoted.] The whole world is embraced in the contract of the great plan of redemption.",
