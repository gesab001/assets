    "word": "Truth, eternal, testing, must be not only professed, but acted. The vials of wrath are to be poured upon the inhabitants of the world who would not be drawn to Christ, and would not be molded into His likeness. Self exaltation was so strongly impregnating the whole character that God would not use them, and His curse is to come upon all such, who have not been beholding Christ, being changed into His image. God has \"loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" All are chosen who through obedience to all the commandments of God will become loyal subjects of His kingdom.",
