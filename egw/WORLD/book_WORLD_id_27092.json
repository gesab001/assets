    "word": "My brother, the Lord does not sanction any disunion or any variance. If you draw in even cords with your Redeemer, you will draw in even cords with your brethren. There is need \n\n\n                                -20- \n\nof unity, else Christ would not have prayed for this oneness. This oneness does not mean that all should do the work you are doing, or that you are to feel that you are to do the work your brethren are doing. Your several works are to blend together. If you are one with Christ and with one another, you bear the credentials that God has sent His Son into the world. The Lord then has a seal to His work. We must cease the work of criticising and fault-finding, and sustain the hands of our brethren.",
