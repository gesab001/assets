    "word": "Satan, Imparts Scientific Knowledge.--In the synagogue of Satan, he brings under his scepter, and into his councils, those agents whom he can use to promote his worship. It is not a strange matter to find a species of refinement, and a manifestation of intellectual greatness in the lives and characters of those who are inspired by fallen angels. Satan can impart scientific knowledge, and give men chapters upon philosophy. He is conversant with history and versed in worldly wisdom.--Undated Ms 66.",
