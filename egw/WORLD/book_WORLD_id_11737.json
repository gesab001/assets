    "word": "The Lord is coming. You have no time to lose. You are not to do as did the inhabitants of the antediluvian world--plant and build, eat and drink, marry and give in marriage, the same as the careless worldling. Let the books of heaven present a different record from that which now appears. Make haste to redeem the time; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not.--Signs of the Times, Jan. 14, 1886.",
