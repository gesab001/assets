Yet a little while, and the world seeth Me no more; but ye see Me: because I live, ye shall live also.\" \"He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.\" \"If a man \n                                                                           138\nlove Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him. He that loveth Me not keepeth not My sayings: and the word which ye hear is not Mine, but the Father's which sent Me.\" The word of a human being is not to be received and believed without question.
