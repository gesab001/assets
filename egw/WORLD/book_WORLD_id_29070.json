    "word": "Temperance Movement. \n\n     To exalt these reforms as though they were in advance of us who, had we followed the light God has given, might have been marching steadily forward in reform for many years, is a sad mistake. If the others choose to take steps in reform hold out your hand to them; but do not step down from your own high standpoint of reform, among them, to work for theirs. It is a shame to those who have had great light and truth upon temperance, that they have not received and practiced it more thoroughly. Had they cherished and lived up to the light they have had, they would be far in advance of what they are now. Some are far behind worldlings upon the point of temperance in many things.",
