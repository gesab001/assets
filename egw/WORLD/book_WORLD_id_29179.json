White, at the Los Angeles \n                           Campmeeting, Sept. 17, 1902. \n\n\n     I read from the second epistle of Peter: \"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according to His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto Life and Godliness, through the Knowledge of Him that hath called us to glory and virtue: where by are given unto use exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\"",
