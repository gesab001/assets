    "word": "In the love of God has been opened the most marvelous vein of precious truth, and the treasures of the grace of Christ are laid open before the church and the world. \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16. What love is this, what marvelous, unfathomable love that would lead Christ to die for us while we were yet sinners. What a loss it is to the soul who understands the strong claims of the law, and who yet fails to understand the grace of Christ which doth much more abound.",
