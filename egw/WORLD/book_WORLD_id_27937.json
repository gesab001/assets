    "word": "Those who today believe in Christ, need more than pentecostal power, inasmuch as He has given them a large, open field in which to work. It is while living here below that we serve the Lord Jesus Christ and show His grace in our words and actions. As the representatives of His kingdom, we are to reveal His character, giving to the world an illustration of what heaven will be. We are to engage in no strife for supremacy, no bitter wrangling. We are not to manifest a selfish or contentious spirit. Our work is to reveal to the world that God's children love one another.",
