    "word": "God does not ask sinners to enter His service with their natural traits of character, to make a failure before the heavenly universe and before the world. . . . The hard, cruel spirit which judges and condemns has left the trace of the enemy upon everything. But mercy is to come in and lay her broad impress upon every plan. The world is to see principles different from those which have hitherto been presented. Christ has erected the cross. He does not call upon any man to manufacture tests and crosses for His people. He presents His requirements before them, and gives them the invitation, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). Wear My yoke, and in your daily experience you will find the rest which comes only to the obedient.",
