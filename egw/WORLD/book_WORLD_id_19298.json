    "word": "His sermon on the mount virtually contradicted the doctrines of the self-righteous scribes and Pharisees. They had so misrepresented God that He was looked upon as a stern judge, incapable of compassion, mercy, and love. They presented to the people endless maxims and traditions as proceeding from God, when they had no \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d for their authority.

Christ made every effort so to sweep away the misrepresentations of Satan, that the confidence of people in the love of God might be restored.\u2014Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 308, 309.",
