I turned to look for the advent people in the world, but could not find them, when a voice said to me, \"Look again, and look a little higher.\" At this, I raised my eyes, and saw a straight and narrow path, cast up high above the world. On this path the advent people were traveling to the city which was at the farther end of the path. They had a bright light set up behind them at the beginning of the path, which an angel told me was the \"midnight cry.\" [See Matthew 25:6.] This light shone all along the path, and gave light for their feet, so that they might not stumble.",
