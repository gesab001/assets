    "word": "Elder J. V. Himes:  My Brother in Christ Jesus:  I received your donation of forty dollars. In the name of our Redeemer I thank you. Be assured we shall invest this money in the best possible way to accomplish the most good for the salvation of souls. . . . The spirited participation evidenced by your donation for this field has rejoiced my heart; for it testifies that you have not lost the missionary spirit which prompted you first to give yourself to the work, and then to give your means to the Lord, to proclaim the first and second angels' messages in their time and order to the world. This is a great gratification to me; for it bears an honorable testimony that your heart is still in the work; I see the proof of your love to the Lord Jesus Christ in your freewill offering for this \"region beyond.\" . . .",
