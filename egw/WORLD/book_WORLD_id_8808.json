    "word": "You may be a great blessing to others if you will give yourself unreservedly to the Lord's service. Power from on high will be given you if you will take your position on the Lord's side. Through Christ you can escape the corruption that is in the world through lust, and be a noble example of what Christ can do for those who cooperate with Him.",
