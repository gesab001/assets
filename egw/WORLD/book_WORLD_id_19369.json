    "word": "The Son of God has set an example for all His followers. They are not to court praise from others, not to seek for themselves ease or wealth, but to emulate His life of purity and self-denial at whatever cost. . . . They will not manifest a disregard for the rights of others. God\u2019s law commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves, to suffer no evil to be instituted against them which we can hinder. But the rule which Christ has given extends still further. Said the world\u2019s Redeemer, \u201cLove one another, as I have loved you.\u201d Nothing short of this can reach the standard of Christianity.\u2014Signs of the Times, Feb. 2, 1882.",
