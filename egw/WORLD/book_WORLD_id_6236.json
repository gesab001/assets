    "word": "It was needful that men should be awakened to their danger; that they should be roused to prepare for the solemn events connected with the close of probation. The prophet of God declares: \u201cThe day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?\u201d [Joel 2:11.] Who shall stand when  He appeareth who is \u201cof purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity?\u201d [Habakkuk 1:13.] To them that cry, \u201cMy  God, we know thee,\u201d yet have transgressed his covenant, \n310\nand hastened after another god, [Hosea 8:2, 1; Psalm 16:4.] hiding iniquity in their hearts, and loving the paths of unrighteousness, to these, the day of the Lord is \u201cdarkness, and not light, even very dark, and no brightness in it.\u201d [Amos 5:20.] \u201cIt shall come to pass at that time,\u201d saith the Lord, \u201cthat I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees; that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.\u201d [Zephaniah 1:12.] \u201cI will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.\u201d [Isaiah 13:11.] \u201cNeither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them;\u201d \u201ctheir goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation.\u201d [Zephaniah 1:18, 13.]",
