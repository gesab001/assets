    "word": "Turning to His disciples, Christ said, \u201cTake heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\u201d Many false messiahs will appear, claiming to work miracles, and declaring that the time of the deliverance of the Jewish nation has come. These will mislead many. These words were fulfilled. Between the death of Christ and the siege of Jerusalem, many false messiahs appeared. But this warning is given also to those who live in this age of the world. The same deceptions practiced prior to the destruction of Jerusalem will be practiced again. The same events that took place at the overthrow of Jerusalem will take place again. . . .",
