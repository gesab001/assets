    "word": "The words were spoken, \"I am the Light of the world. Kindle your soul's light from the wisdom of human agencies, and your light will go out in darkness. Seek My wisdom, and you will be guided by unerring counsel. This guidance it is the privilege of every child of God to have. Ask, and ye shall receive; but ask in faith believing. Ask for that which is in accordance with the Word of God. Believing, ye shall receive.\"",
