    "word": "To our sanitariums has been given the work of reaching the higher classes. This work is to be done, not by consorting with them, and providing entertainments for them, but by revealing the power of the truth to transform the character. Every human being who is sanctified through a belief of the truth becomes God's light bearer to the world, His helping hand for the recovering of souls from transgression. He is God's medical missionary. Ms 83, 1901, p. 1. (\"God's Purpose for His Sanitariums,\" August 26, 1901.)",
