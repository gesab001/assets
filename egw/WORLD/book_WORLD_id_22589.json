    "word": "Talent is ever best developed and best appreciated where it is most needed. But this truth is overlooked by many eager aspirants for distinction.

The Lord does not call them as he did Joseph and Daniel, to withstand the temptations of worldly honor and high station. But they force themselves into positions of danger, and desert the only post of duty for which they are fitted.",
