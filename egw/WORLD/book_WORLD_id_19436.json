    "word": "As we read the Word of God, how plain it appears that His people are to be peculiar and distinct from the unbelieving world around them. Our position is interesting and fearful; living in the last days, how important that we imitate the example of Christ, and walk even as He walked. \u201cIf any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\u201d The opinions and wisdom of mortals must not guide or govern us. They always lead away from the cross.",
