{"word": "The apostle Paul felt the importance of faithfulness. He says of his own ministry in Christ, \\93whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.\\94 [Colossians 1:28, 29.] And he exhorts Timothy, \\93Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\\94 [2 Timothy 4:2.] This is in accordance with the word which through the prophet Isaiah the Lord has spoken to the watchmen on the walls of Zion: \\93Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\\94 [Isaiah 58:1.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 449}
