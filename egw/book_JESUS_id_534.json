{"word": "During His ministry, Jesus devoted more time to healing the sick than to preaching. His miracles testified to the truth of His words, that He came not to destroy, but to save. Wherever He went, the tidings of His mercy preceded Him. Where He had passed, the objects of His compassion were rejoicing in health and making trial of their new-found powers. Crowds were collecting around them to hear from their lips the works that the Lord had wrought. His voice was the first sound that many had ever heard, His name the first word they had ever spoken, His \n60\nface the first they had ever looked upon. Why should they not love Jesus and sound His praise? As He passed through the towns and cities He was like a vital current, diffusing life and joy.\n\n\\93The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, \nToward the sea, beyond the Jordan, \nGalilee of the nations,\nThe people that sat in darkness \nSaw a great light, \nAnd to them that sat in the region and shadow of death, \nTo them did light spring up.\\94\nMatthew 4:15, 16, A.R.V., margin.
