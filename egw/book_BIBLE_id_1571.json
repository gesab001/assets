{"word": "Men of learning and piety had labored in vain to bring about a reform in these monastic orders; but Wycliffe, with clearer insight, struck at the root of the evil, declaring that the system itself was false, and that it should be abolished. Discussion and inquiry were awakening. As the monks traversed the country, vending the pope's pardons, \n84\nmany were led to doubt the possibility of purchasing forgiveness with money, and they questioned whether they should not seek pardon from God rather than from the pontiff of Rome. Not a few were alarmed at the rapacity of the friars, whose greed seemed never to be satisfied. \\93The monks and priests of Rome,\\94 said they, \\93are eating us away like a cancer. God must deliver us, or the people will perish.\\94 To cover their avarice, these begging monks claimed that they were following the Saviour's example, declaring that Jesus and his disciples had been supported by the charities of the people. This claim resulted in injury to their cause, for it led many to the Bible to learn the truth for themselves, \\97a result which of all others was least desired by Rome. The minds of men were directed to the Source of truth, which it was her object to conceal.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 83}
