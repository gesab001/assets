{"word": "Section Three - The Work in the Cities\n[IN THE FIVE ARTICLES\nIN THIS SECTION THERE HAVE BEEN GATHERED TOGETHER AND\nGROUPED IN CONVENIENT ORDER SOME OF THE MANY INSTRUCTIVE,\nCHEERING, AND INSPIRING TESTIMONIES REGARDING WORK IN\nTHE CITIES. THE STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS COMPILATION\nHAVE BEEN FOUND IN SPECIAL TESTIMONIES, IN ARTICLES\nPUBLISHED IN OUR PERIODICALS, IN THE REPORTS OF SERMONS\nAT THE 1909 GENERAL CONFERENCE, AND IN LETTERS TO WORKERS\nIN THE LARGE CITIES.]\n\n                          \"I heard the voice of the Lord saying, \n                          Whom shall I send, and who \n                          will go for us? Then said I, Here \n                          am I; send me.\" Isaiah 6:8. \n\n\n                 Conditions in the Cities \n\n\n     There is coming rapidly and surely an almost universal guilt upon the inhabitants of the cities because of the steady increase of determined wickedness. We are living in the midst of an \"epidemic of crime\" at which thoughtful, God-fearing men everywhere stand aghast. The corruption that prevails is beyond the power of the human pen to describe. Every day brings fresh revelations of political strife, bribery, and fraud; every day brings its heartsickening record of violence and lawlessness, of indifference to human suffering; of brutal, fiendish destruction of human life. Every day testifies to the increase of insanity, murder, and suicide.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "9T", "page": 89}
