{"word": "NOTE 10. PAGE 565.\\97THERE IS NO MORE REMARKABLE MOVEMENT OF THE PRESENT DAY, AND NO ONE FRAUGHT WITH MORE VITAL CONSEQUENCES TO MEN AND NATIONS, THAN THE RAPIDLY REVIVING INFLUENCE OF THE PAPACY IN NATIONAL AFFAIRS. THE PAPACY IS FAST MOVING INTO THE PLACE OF THE GREATEST INFLUENCE OF ANY EARTHLY ORGANIZATION. IN EUROPE, TO SAY NOTHING OF CATHOLIC COUNTRIES, WHICH, AS A MATTER OF COURSE, ARE SUBJECT TO THE POPE, CHANCELLOR BISMARCK HAS MADE GERMANY VIRTUALLY SUBJECT TO THE DICTATION OF THE PAPACY; ENGLAND HAS INVITED THE INTERFERENCE OF THE POPE IN HER POLITICAL AFFAIRS IN THE CONTEST \n687\nWITH IRELAND; AND EVEN THE CZAR OF RUSSIA HAS SHOWN HIMSELF WILLING TO MAKE OVERTURES TO THE PAPACY. ON THE OCCASION OF THE GOLDEN JUBILEE OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF LEO XIII., IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT, EXCEPT THE KINGDOM OF ITALY AND THE UNITED KINGDOMS OF SWEDEN AND NORWAY, EVERY NATION, PROTESTANT AS WELL AS CATHOLIC, PAID GRATEFUL RESPECT TO ROME.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 686}
