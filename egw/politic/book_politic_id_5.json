{"word": "Woman's Rights.\\97There are speculations as to woman's rights, and her duty in regard to voting; but many women have had no discipline which would qualify them to understand the bearing of important questions. They have lived a life of fashion and self-gratification. Women who might develop a good intellect, who might perfect a noble character, are mere slaves to custom. They lack breadth of thought and intellectual culture. They can talk understandingly of the latest styles of dress, or of \n160\nthe next party or ball; but they are not prepared to act wisely in political matters. They are mere creatures of circumstance.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CTBH", "page": 159}
