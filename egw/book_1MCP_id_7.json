{"word": "Teacher's Usefulness Depends Upon a Trained Mind.--The teacher's usefulness depends not so much upon the actual amount of his acquirements as upon the standard at which he aims. The true teacher is not content with dull thoughts, and indolent mind, or a loose memory. He constantly seeks higher attainments and better methods. His life is one of continual growth. In the work of such a teacher there is a freshness, a quickening power, that awakens and inspires his pupils.--Ed 278 (1903).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 4}
