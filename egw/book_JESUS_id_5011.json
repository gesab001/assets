{"word": "Christ taught that His church is a spiritual kingdom. He Himself, \"the Prince of peace,\" is the head of His church. In His person humanity, inhabited by divinity, was represented to the world. The great end of His mission was to be a sin-offering for the world, that by the shedding of blood an atonement might be made for the whole race of men. With a heart ever touched with the feelings of our infirmities, an ear ever open to the cry of suffering humanity, a hand ever ready to save the discouraged and despairing, Jesus, our Saviour, \"went about doing good\" (Acts 10:38). . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 14}
