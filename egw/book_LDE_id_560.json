{"word": "Chap. 11. - Satan's Last Day Deceptions\n\n                 Under the Garb of Christianity \n\n     We are approaching the end of this earth's history, and Satan is working as never before. He is striving to act as director of the Christian world. With an intensity that is marvelous he is working with his lying wonders. Satan is represented as walking about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. He desires to embrace the whole world in his confederacy. Hiding his deformity under the garb of Christianity, he assumes the attributes of a Christian, and claims to be Christ Himself.--8MR 346 (1901).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 155}
