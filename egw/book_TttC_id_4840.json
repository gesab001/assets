    "word": "God is leading out a people to stand in perfect unity upon the platform of eternal truth. Christ gave Himself to the world that He might \"purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\" This refining process is designed to purge the church from all unrighteousness and the spirit of discord and contention, that they may build up instead of tear down, and concentrate their energies on the great work before them. God designs that His people should all come into the unity of the faith. The prayer of the Christ just prior to His crucifixion was that His disciples might be one, even as He was one with the Father, that the world might believe that the Father had sent Him. This most touching and wonderful prayer reaches down the ages, even to our day; for His words were: \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.\"",
