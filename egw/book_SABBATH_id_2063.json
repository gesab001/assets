{"word": "The work of Sabbath reform to be accomplished in the last days is clearly brought to view in the prophecy of Isaiah: \"Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice; for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.\" \"The sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer.\" [Isaiah 56:1, 2, 6, 7.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 283}
