{"word": "PAGE 276: SLAVES AND MASTER.--ACCORDING TO REVELATION 6:15, 16 THERE WILL BE SLAVERY AT THE SECOND ADVENT OF CHRIST. HERE WE FIND THE WORDS \"EVERY BONDMAN, AND EVERY FREE MAN.\" THE STATEMENT BY ELLEN WHITE UNDER DISCUSSION INDICATES THAT SHE WAS SHOWN IN VISION THE SLAVE AND THE SLAVE MASTER AT THE SECOND ADVENT OF CHRIST. IN THIS SHE IS IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE BIBLE. BOTH JOHN AND MRS. WHITE WERE SHOWN CONDITIONS THAT WOULD EXIST AT THE SECOND COMING OF OUR LORD. WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT NEGRO SLAVES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE FREED BY THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT SIX YEARS AFTER STATEMENT UNDER DISCUSSION WAS PENNED, THE MESSAGE IS NOT MADE INVALID, FOR EVEN TODAY THERE ARE MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN IN ACTUAL OR VIRTUAL SLAVERY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PASS JUDGMENT ON A PROPHECY OF THE FUTURE UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE TIME FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THAT PROPHECY.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 304}
