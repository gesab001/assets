{"word": "You have thought when you could realize a certain prosperity in your business, then you would obey the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. But the Lord requires of every one of His subjects entire obedience. God's requirements were upon you, and you have been making terms with God. And all the time Satan has been working to make it more and still more impossible as you look at the matter, to decide to keep the Sabbath. You have been growing less and less susceptible to the movings of the Spirit of God upon your heart. The Lord has given me a message for you and for your children to take up your long-neglected duty, to walk in the light as He is in the light. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind.\" \"This do,\" said Christ of a lawyer, \"and thou shalt live.\" This is the voice of God \n                                                                           243\nto yourself and to your children. The law of God is good as well as just and profitable to all who obey, and you will show honor to Him whom you obey.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 242}
