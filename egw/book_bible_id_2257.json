{"word": "\"These were my closing labors in the East on this journey,\" wrote Mrs. White of the Bible Institutes attended; \"and I have to say to the praise of God, that He has sustained me at every step. I have prayed in the night season; and in the day, when traveling, I have been pleading with God for strength, for grace, for light from His presence; and I know in whom I have believed. I return to California with more strength and better courage than I had when I left Oakland the 12th of August. [MRS. WHITE REACHED HER HEALDSBURG HOME DEC. 30, 1883, HAVING BEEN ABSENT NEARLY FIVE MONTHS.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 280}
