{"word": "The wise men were surprised at the questions that the child Jesus asked. . . . When there was a pause, Mary, the mother of Jesus, came up to her son and asked, \\93Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.\\94 Then a divine light shone from Jesus\\92 face, as He lifted His hand and said, \\93How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father\\92s business?\\94. . . They did not know what He really meant by these words, but they knew He was a true son, who would be submissive to their commands. Though He was the Son of God, He went down to Nazareth and was subject to His parents.\\97Youth\\92s Instructor, Nov. 28, 1895.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 223}
