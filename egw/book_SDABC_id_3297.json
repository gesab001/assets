    "word": "4 (2 Peter 3:18; 2 John 6). Love for Christ Need Not Flag.--\"Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.\" Thine is a decay, a declension in holy zeal--not forsaken is the object of it, but lost is the fervor. The first affection of the convert to Christ is deep, full, and ardent. It is not necessary that this love should become less as knowledge increases, as the more and increased light shines upon him. That love should become more fervent as he becomes better acquainted with his Lord. . . .",
