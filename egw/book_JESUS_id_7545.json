{"word": "The lessons contained in the words of Paul to Timothy are of the greatest importance to us today. He charges him to \"be strong\"--in his own wisdom? No, but \"in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.\" He who would be a follower of Christ is not to rely upon his own capabilities, or to feel confident in himself. Neither is to be dwarfed in his religious efforts, to shun responsibilities, and remain inefficient in the cause of God. He is to draw strength from a sure and safe source, that never fails those who would have divine power. The exhortation to us is, \"Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.\" If the Christian feels his weakness, his inability, by putting his trust in God, he will find the grace of Christ sufficient for every emergency.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 267}
