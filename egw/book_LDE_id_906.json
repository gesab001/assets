{"word": "And \"the rivers and fountains of waters . . . became blood.\" Terrible as these inflictions are, God's justice stands fully vindicated. The angel of God declares: \"Thou art righteous, O Lord, . . . because Thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and Thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy\" (Revelation 16:2-6).
