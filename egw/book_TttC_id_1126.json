    "word": "Brethren would better be contented with a small income, and handle that little prudently, rather than run risks to better their condition, and suffer continual losses thereby. Some Sabbathkeepers who have engaged in the sale of patent rights, have traveled among their brethren to save expense, and have induced them to invest their means in patent rights. Such will not be clear before God until they have made up the loss which these brethren have sustained.",
