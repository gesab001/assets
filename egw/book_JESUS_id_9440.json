{"word": "With all our sins and weakness we are not cast aside as worthless. \"He hath made us accepted in the beloved.\" Ephesians 1:6. The glory that rested upon Christ is a pledge of the love of God for us. It tells of the power of prayer--how the human voice may reach the ear of God, and our petitions find acceptance in the courts of heaven. The light that fell from the open portals upon the head of our Saviour, will fall upon us as we pray for help to resist temptation. The voice that spoke to Jesus says to every believing soul, \"This is my beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 156}
