{"word": "Then come, and seek, and find. The reservoir of power is open, is full and free. Come with humble hearts, not thinking that you must do some good thing to merit the favor of God, or that you must make yourself better before you can come to Christ. You can never do anything to better your condition. In the name of Jesus, come with full assurance of faith, because you are a sinner; for Christ said, \"I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\" (Matthew 9:13). Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. You are to ask, to seek, to knock, and to believe that you are accepted through Christ Jesus, trusting Him alone to do those things for you which you can never do for yourself. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 133}
