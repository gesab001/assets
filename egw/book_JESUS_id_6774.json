{"word": "Exalt the Word of God \n\n     If we work to create an excitement of feeling, we shall have all we want, and more than we can possibly know how to manage. Calmly and clearly \"Preach the Word.\" We must not regard it as our work to create an excitement. The Holy Spirit of God alone can create a healthy enthusiasm. Let God work, and let the human agent walk softly before Him, watching, waiting, praying, looking unto Jesus every moment, led and controlled by the precious Spirit, which is light and life.--2SM 16, 17 (1894).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 93}
