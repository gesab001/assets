    "word": "You cannot serve God and mammon. You are either wholly on the Lord's side or on the side of the enemy. \"He that is not with Me is against Me; and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\" Some persons make their religious life a failure because they are always wavering and do not have determination. They are frequently convicted and come almost up to the point of surrendering all for God; but, failing to meet the point, they fall back again. While in this state the conscience is hardening and becoming less and less susceptible to the impressions of the Spirit of God. His Spirit has warned, has convicted, and has been disregarded, until it is nearly grieved away. God will not be trifled with. He shows duty clearly, and if there is a neglect to follow the light, it becomes darkness.",
