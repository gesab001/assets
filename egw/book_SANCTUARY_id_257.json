{"word": "The intercession of Christ in man's behalf in the sanctuary above is as essential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the cross. . . . Through defects in the character, Satan works to gain control of the whole mind, and he knows that if these defects are cherished, he will succeed. Therefore he is constantly seeking to deceive the followers of Christ with his fatal sophistry that it is impossible for them to overcome. But Jesus pleads in their behalf His wounded hands, His bruised body; and He declares to all who would follow Him: \"My grace is sufficient for thee\" (2 Corinthians 12:9). . . . Let none, then, regard their defects as incurable. God will give faith and grace to overcome them.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 69}
