    "word": "I am just as anxious to write to you as you are to write to me. This afternoon I received a letter, Sister Haskell, which you sent to St. Helena. Sister Peck sent me the letter you wrote to her. I was very glad indeed to get these letters. Every letter that you have written me has been eagerly perused. You need never fear that I shall not be interested; for I am deeply interested in every crumb of news you send.--Letter 153, 1902, p. 5. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, September 27, 1902.)",
