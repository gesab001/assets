    "word": "MR No. 694 - Ellen White's Sister, Caroline Clough\n\n     You may be anxious to hear in regard to my sister, your aunt. You have never seen her. She is an understanding, intelligent woman, living, I think, up to the best light she has had. She is a powerful singer. This is as much her talent as speaking is mine. I think I never heard a voice that would thrill the soul like hers. We are having a most precious time. They have a very pretty location. The house is small, but convenient for this country. Brother Clough and Caroline are intent upon our remaining over.-- Letter 10, 1872, pp. 2,3. (To J. E. White and wife, July 4, 1872.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. February 20, 1979",
