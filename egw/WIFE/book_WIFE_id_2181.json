    "word": "May the Lord help your wife, as the Great Physician only can, and may the Lord give you wisdom to preserve yourself in your difficulties from so many burdens, and to unload every burden possible. May the Lord God give courage, but shun many responsibilities; shun all that you can. Walk circumspectly before God, which I believe you will do. Walk by faith. Cling to the Mighty One every moment and do not let go. There is a great work to be done. If you will work slowly and considerately and not become confused then you will not work unwisely, but you will gain nothing by overloading yourself.--Letter 294, 1903. (Written November 10, 1903, from Elmshaven, to P. T. Magan.) \n\nWhite Estate, Washington, D. C. November 3, 1983",
