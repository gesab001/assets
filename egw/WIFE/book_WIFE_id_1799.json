    "word": "You do not need the excitement of theaters and plays to while away your time. You have a character to form after the divine similitude. If you will believe with all your heart, you will be worked by the Holy Spirit. Then you will never hunger for cheap, earthly amusement. The grace of God will be your helper, your strength.--Letter 171, 1899, pp. 4-5. (To Harmon Lindsay and his wife Annie, Nov. 2, 1899.)",
