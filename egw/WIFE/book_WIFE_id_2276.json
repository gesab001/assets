    "word": "You say that J was engaged to some young lady in Topeka. I cannot speak concerning this, for I have not heard J's reasons for breaking his engagement, if he did so. But I had a personal knowledge of his former relations with his first wife K. J loved K far too well, for she was not worthy of his regard. He did all in his power to help her, and sought in every possible way to retain her as his wife. He could not have done more than he did do. I pleaded with her, and tried to show her the inconsistency of her course, and begged her not to obtain a divorce; but she was determined and willful and stubborn, and would have her own way. While she lived with him, she sought to secure all the money possible from him, but she would not treat him kindly as a wife should treat her husband. \n\n\n                                  -147-",
