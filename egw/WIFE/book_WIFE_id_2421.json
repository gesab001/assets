    "word": "We are pleasantly situated in Basel, but shall be prepared to leave in one year. I look home to California often, but not in the same way Lot's wife looked back to Sodom. But I have left home and all its comfort and all its attraction. I consider the cause of God and its workings of greater consequence to me than anything that I possess. I will not worry about home, but just as soon as my work is done I shall go back willingly. You will see by this letter that I want you both to move understandingly and with a consciousness that the Lord is leading and guiding. I cannot tell either of you your duty or where you shall go or what you will do. Let the Lord lead and guide you. I believe He will. With much love, I remain, your true friend.--Letter 78, 1886. \n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nApril 18, 1991. Entire Letter.",
