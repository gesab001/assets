    "word": "When  Abraham was nearly one hundred years old, the promise of a son was repeated to him, with the assurance that the  future heir should be the child of Sarah. But Abraham did not yet understand the promise. His mind at once turned to Ishmael, clinging to the belief that through him God's gracious purposes were to be accomplished. In his affection for his son he exclaimed, \"O that Ishmael might live before thee!\" Again the promise was given, in words that could not be mistaken: \"Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him.\" . . .",
