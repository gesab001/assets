    "word": "Some days ago I received copies of a number of testimonials written for Brother N_____ by different men in official positions. I read these testimonials. In the night season a representation passed before me. Brother and Sister N_____ were looking over these testimonials. As they were talking together, there stood by their side, not the One who appeared to Brother N_____ on a certain occasion--the Messenger of heaven--but an evil messenger, who insinuated into Brother N_____'s mind the belief that his brethren wanted to get control of his property, and to put him and his wife out of the work. . . .

Many false reports were received as truth. Next, Brother N_____ was represented to me as writing letters containing these false reports. . . .",
