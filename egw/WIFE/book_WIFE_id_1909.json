We know that we have counted pennies and means in every way in order that we might have enough means for the bare necessaries of life and to carry us from place to place, to present the truth to others. I well remember the first conference that was ever held by our people. It was in Connecticut [1848]. My husband worked at cutting cordwood at twenty-five cents a cord to earn money to take us to this meeting. He was not accustomed to this kind of labor and the rheumatism came in his wrist. He was unable to sleep nights, and night after night our prayers ascended, that God would relieve him of pain. He said, \"Wife, we must keep five dollars on hand, and even if we get short of food we must not use that.\" I fainted to the floor, with a nursing child in my arms more than once for the want of necessary food to eat. But when the call came from a few faithful souls, Cannot you come and hold a meeting with us in Connecticut, we felt the Lord \n\n\n                                   -131- \n\nwould have us go. When my husband settled with his employer, he had ten dollars. With this we made the journey. . . .",
