    "word": "Our laborers must learn to exercise economy, not only in their efforts to advance the cause of truth, \n                                                                           460\nbut in their home expenses. They should place their families where they can be cared for at as little expense as possible. Donations and bequests do not come to our work as they do to other denominations; and those who have not educated themselves to live within their means, will surely have to do this, or else engage in some other employment. Habits of self-indulgence, or a want of tact and skill on the part of the wife and mother, may be a constant drain upon the treasury; and yet that mother may think she is doing her best, because she has never been taught to restrict her wants or the wants of her children, and has never acquired skill and tact in household matters. Hence one family may require for its support twice the amount that would suffice for another family of the same size.",
