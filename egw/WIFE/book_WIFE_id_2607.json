    "word": "We have not a physician yet for St. Helena. We have no use for Dr. Sanderson and shall not give him another call. His wife is sufficient objection to his coming to St. Helena. Dr. Bush is promised to spend Sabbath and Sunday and to come to the call in an emergency. We dare not plant Dr. Sanderson and his wife on the hillside. We are afraid of the result. The Lord will send us a physician we believe, and we will watch and pray lest we enter into temptation. We see no call for Dr. Sanderson until he is a converted man.",
