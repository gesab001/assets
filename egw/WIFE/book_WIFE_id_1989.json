    "word": "We make our home at Brother Thompson's (at whose table we are now writing). He and his wife are whole-hearted in the truth. They have four \n\n\n                                    -340- \n\ndaughters with them in the faith. Their ages are 24, 22, 20 and 12. They are goodhearted girls and are trying to serve God. Their voices were never heard in prayer until after the Milton conference. We had a powerful season of prayer and the burden of their cases was rolled upon me. I pleaded the promises of God for them, and could not give it up, and finally their voices were raised in prayer to God.--Letter 7, 1851, p. 1. (To Brother and Sister Hastings, July 27, 1851.)",
