    "word": "P.S. Nearing Elko Station; about six o'clock. We have had a very pleasant day. A number of men stopped at Reno. Brother Balborn and wife called upon us while the passengers were taking breakfast. We had quite a pleasant visit. Besides us, there are only three men in the car. The porter has been an old hand on the train, kind as kind can be. We have had a little dust, and a small spurt of a shower.",
