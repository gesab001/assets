    "word": "MR No. 1224 - The Church is the Bride of Christ\n\n     God calls the church His body. The church is the bride, the Lamb's wife. God is the Father of the family, the Shepherd of the flock. But a mere outward connection with any church will not save a man. It is personal faith in a personal Saviour which brings the soul into spiritual union with Christ. This truth Christ plainly teaches in the sixth chapter of John.-- Ms 121, 1899, p. 17. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. October 30, 1986.",
