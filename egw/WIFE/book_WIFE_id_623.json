    "word": "In Eden, God said to Adam concerning the tree of knowledge, \"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\" \"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\" Adam listened to the voice of Satan speaking through his wife; he believed another voice than that which spoke the law in Eden. . . .",
