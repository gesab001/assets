    "word": "Elder Butler is strong in physical and spiritual health.  The Lord has proved and tested and tried him, as He did Job, and as He did Moses.  I see in Elder Butler one who has humbled his soul before God.  He has another spirit than the Elder Butler of younger years. He has been learning his lesson at the feet of Jesus. After caring so long for his suffering, afflicted wife, he has come forth from the furnace fire refined and purified. I respect and love my brother as one of God's servants.",
