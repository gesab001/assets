    "word": "You have a wife and children. Your wife has home duties, and you must not depend upon her to accompany you, and she must not depend upon you, feeling that she must be always with you. When you can do so, unite your efforts; when you cannot unite them, do your individual work manfully, drawing inspiration from righteous principles, from fixed religious principles and from convictions as to what God expects of you. If you do not feel that you are a part of God's great firm, then arouse yourself to realize the situation, face your responsibilities as one who must give account for your talent of time. If you have the abiding love of Christ in your heart, you would do your best for Christ's sake who gave his life for you.--Letter 126, 1900, pp. 3, 4. (To Brother Hickox, August 5, 1900.) \n\n\n                                    -47-",
