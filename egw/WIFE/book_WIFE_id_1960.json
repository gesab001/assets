    "word": "The work in Greater New York is to be carried on in a way that will properly represent the sacredness and holiness of the truth of God. Vegetarian restaurants, treatment rooms, cooking schools, are to be established. The people are to be taught how to prepare wholesome food. They are to be educated by showing the need of discarding tea, coffee, and flesh meat. There are to be suitable furnished rooms, where people can be received, and given religious instruction.--Letter 49, 1902, p. 12. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, February 5, 1902.)",
