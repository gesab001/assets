    "word": "Faultfinding and Rebukes Encourage Deception. --My brother, your overbearing words hurt your children. As they advance in years their tendency to criticize will grow. Faultfinding is corrupting your life and is extending to your wife and to your children. Your children are not encouraged to give you their confidence or to acknowledge their faults, because they know that your stern rebuke is sure to follow. Your words are often as a desolating hail which breaks down tender plants. It is impossible to estimate the harm thus done. Your children practice deception in order to avoid the hard words you speak. They will evade the truth to escape censure and punishment. A hard, cold command will do them no good.--Lt 8a, 1896. (AH 439, 440.)",
