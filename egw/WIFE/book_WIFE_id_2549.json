Haskell\n\n                                                      H - 13 - 1892 \n\n                                     North Fitzroy, August 22, 1892. \n\nDear Brother Haskell,-- \n     We received your letters last Thursday evening. The coming of the mail with news from our American friends is always a great event to us. As soon as we get off the mail to America we begin to reckon the days when the mail will arrive. I was somewhat surprised to learn that your wife had safely taken the long journey to California. And I sincerely hope and pray that she will have the peace of Christ, and rest content, and be happy in His love. This is her privilege. Jesus loves this daughter of Abraham and He will not be unmindful of her, but will care for her as a tender mother cares for her child. I think of her with sympathy and tender compassion.",
