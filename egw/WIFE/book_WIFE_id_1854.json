    "word": "Diary \n\n     December 24, 1886. In early morning we took the cars for Tramelan-- Elder Ings and wife and I. Waited one hour at Travannes, then we were taken in dummy to Tramelan. We had just five seats in the cars, and a small stove. We had just had a heavy snowstorm at Basel, but there had been a greater fall of snow as we neared the mountains. We passed slowly along, and the trees looked very beautiful laden down with pure, fresh snow. Some trees had blown over, one uprooted. I think I never saw anything equal to this for beauty-- the tall evergreen trees, their boughs loaded with snow. It is a picture of added loveliness. We have not seen a sight like this in magnitude for very many years. I was back in my girlhood in my native State, passing through the pine forests and exclaiming with delight at the lovely picture presented, but I had seen nothing to remind me of this scene so thoroughly as this morning. Thirty years ago such scenes were familiar in the State of Maine. We waited at depot some time for conveyance. At length Brother Roth's son came with sleigh for us, and we had the first sleigh ride we have had for \n\n\n                                    -26- \n\nyears. It was quite mild. We were welcomed by Brother Roth's family, and all was done for us to make us comfortable. In the evening Brother Erzberger spoke to the Germans. Several came in from Chaux-de-Fonds and Lausanne. Friday night we had a heavy fall of snow. At Travannes wrote to Professor Brownsberger.",
