    "word": "Isolation of T.B. Patients.--I have been conversing with you in the night season in regard to some matters that I will write you about. We were conversing in reference to Brother Hansen and his manufacturing health foods. In regard to the family, you understand that Sister Hansen must be carefully cared for, because she has had lung trouble. It would be well for them to be provided with a home by themselves. They can be so located that burdens shall not come upon Sister Hansen too heavily, and where she can care for their own family. She may entirely recover from her lung difficulty, but it will be well to take every precaution. Matters can be managed so that those who need to be connected with the institution may not in any way be exposed. You and your wife may be wise on this subject, and a word to the wise is sufficient.--Letter 329, 1905, p. 1. (To J. A. Burden, December 11, 1905.)",
