These prompt a desire for outward show and an appearance of being linked with the friendship of the world. Self-righteousness, which is so deceptive, is bound up with the unsanctified heart. The warning is given us, \"Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God\" (James 4:4).

Oh, that they may exalt the Lord God and let Him be their fear and their dread.--Letter 121, 1900, pp. 3-8. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, August 13, 1900.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C.
