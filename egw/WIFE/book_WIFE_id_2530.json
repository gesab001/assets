She stated that their family did not place any particular faith now in Sister White's testimony. She said Elder Smith, Elder Butler, Elder Canright, and mentioned other names of the elders, did not any longer regard the testimonies as they once did but they considered Sister White's work and influence was a thing of the past. We had got beyond the need of the testimonies. She claimed to know that she had good authority for her statements. She said a reproof was given to their family which was not true. Dr. Lay heard what his wife and girls said and he told Sister Douse not to let their words have any influence upon them. He said he was embarrassed to make the statement that his wife and children were not in a clear spiritual state, and he wished her to understand that he believed every word of the testimonies and those referring to their family he knew to be true, every word of them.",
