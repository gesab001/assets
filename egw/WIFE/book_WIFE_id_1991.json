    "word": "MR No. 628 - Pius VI, The Pope of the Deadly Wound\n\n     That afternoon [November 2] he [Elder Bourdeau] had us accompany him to the Cathedral [in Valence, France] and look upon the bust of Pius VI who was noted in prophecy, who was led into captivity and died in captivity. Here was the one marked in history who received the deadly wound. His heart is encased in the marble monument beneath where the bust is located. We felt rather solemn as we looked upon the monument of this man noted in prophecy.--Letter 110, 1886, p. 2. (To W. C. White and wife, November 4, 1886.) \n\nReleased June 21, 1978.",
