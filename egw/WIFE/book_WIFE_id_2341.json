    "word": "I counsel you, both husband and wife, to give up the financial management of the institution. Let this burden rest upon a carefully selected board, not chosen through your influence but by the judgment of those upon whom the responsibility rests. Let these directors wrestle with the problem of bringing the expenditure of the institution within the income, and there will be a binding about of the business transactions. The business will not be run wildly in accordance with your mind and your wife's mind and your brother's mind.",
