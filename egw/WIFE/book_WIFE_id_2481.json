    "word": "Rome, New York, Tuesday, October 14, 1890 \n\n     I arose at Adams Center, October 14, at four o'clock and my heart was filled with gratitude to God for His loving mercy and continual goodness to me. \n\n\n                                    -8- \n\nI have slept well. My heart is thankful. We have been preserved on the journey to this place; no accident or harm has befallen us. We left Adams Center at half past seven o'clock and went through to Rome without change. Brother Place engaged a hack and we rode one mile to his house. We were pleased to meet his wife and little son in his own home. We slept well through the night and were refreshed.--Ms. 42, 1890, p. 1 (Diary 16, p. 217).",
