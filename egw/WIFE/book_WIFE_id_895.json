    "word": "As you look upon your little ones, toward whom your wife so faithfully discharged her responsibilities as a  mother, you have reason for rejoicing that she has done what she could to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The blessed Saviour, who took little children in His arms and blessed them, will not leave your children or you comfortless. A double responsibility now rests upon you. May the Lord inspire the hearts of those who shall deal with these lambs of Christ's fold, to treat them gently, tenderly, lovingly, so that their young and  inexperienced feet may be ever guided to walk safely.",
