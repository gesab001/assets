    "word": "Elder Van Horn has done a great wrong. He has lessened your confidence in any helpers that might be sent you, so that you have become discouraged and jealous and suspicious. Now all this must cease. Elder Van Horn has proved himself unworthy of the presidency of your conference, and this makes me sad indeed. God designed he and his (wife) Adelia should stand side by side--Adelia making up the deficiencies of her husband in financial ability, and they two would make a complete whole, but they have burdened themselves with domestic cares and let these come in to the detriment of the cause of God, which work he was here to advance.",
