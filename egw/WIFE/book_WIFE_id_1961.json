    "word": "He to whom the Lord has given a commission is not to submerge his identity in any human being. God declares, \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.--A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.\" (James 1:5-8.)--Letter 17, 1902, pp. 4, 5. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, February 6, 1902.)",
