    "word": "MR No. 858 - Ellen White and Domesticity\n\n     I learn that Flora Merriam is dead. She was out at the camp meeting, but she now sleeps in Jesus. Her probation is ended. W. P. sickened and died suddenly. He professed to be a follower of Christ, but the attractions of the world ensnared him. When smitten by disease he was too sick to exercise his mind in repenting, and died, we fear, without expressing hope. Had he lived up to the light of health reform, he might not have died. I might relate several cases who have sickened and died suddenly without any time to prepare for their last change. I know not the facts in regard to Flora Merriam. She was an excellent girl--grave, sedate and retiring--more so than many who are older than she.--Letter 51a, 1874, p. 1. (To J. E. White and wife, Sept. 11, 1874.)",
