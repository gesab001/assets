    "word": "Elder Daniels, my heart is sad for you, for your wife, and your children, for I say to you in the fear of God, You are making a record that will be lasting as eternity; \"and if ye have not been faithful in that which \n\n\n                        [70] \n\nis another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?\" We are placed here as probationers, to prove whether we will, through the grace of Christ, develop all that the Lord exacts of us. We have been intrusted with great light in regard to the truths of his holy word, and with mental faculties susceptible of the highest cultivation. You are to love God supremely, and your neighbors as yourself. You are to prove yourself faithful even in the least temporal matters. If you disregard the plainest directions given by our Lord in his holy word, and by the testimony of his Spirit, and choose to walk in your own way, to follow the impulse of your own heart, you will be pronounced an unfaithful steward. If you prove yourself unfit to hold the smallest interests which your Master has placed in your hands here, how can God trust you with eternal interests? You may give your money quite freely to our institutions or to individuals, but does God honor you for this? If the money has been obtained unjustly, will he accept this offering at your hands? You may ease your conscience by saying, \"I give to the cause what others have given me.\" Tell these persons they should be stewards of their own means.",
