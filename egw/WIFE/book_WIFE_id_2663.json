    "word": "But I dare not counsel our ministers and missionaries who are continually moving from place to place, to encumber themselves by adopting children, especially helpless infants. Those who have children of their own must share the responsibility of training them to do service for God. It is the wife's duty to care for the children and husband. The Lord will give her strength to do this work if she will put her trust in Him and obey the laws of life and health. The husband and wife are to unite in the work of bringing up the children in the love and fear of God. A well ordered and well disciplined family will have a powerful influence for good. But if you have no children of your own, it may be that the Lord has a wise purpose in withholding from you this blessing. It should not be taken as evidence that it is your duty to adopt a child. In some cases this might be advisable. When the Lord bids you take an infant to bring up, then the duty is too plain to be misunderstood. But, as a rule, it is not God's will for a minister's wife to encumber herself with such a responsibility.",
