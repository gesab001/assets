    "word": "Elder Haskell has suffered a great deal from boils. He has taken treatment at the Sanitarium several times, but most of his treatment he has taken in his room in our house. Our home has been his sanitarium. He has been afflicted continuously, and has kept to his bed most of the time. Pulverized charcoal poultices have been used with good results. His wife is a good nurse, and she has taken faithful care of him. He has thought several times that he had overcome the affliction, and that he would recover rapidly, but as soon as he began to stir around, boils would again appear. His countenance looks clear and wholesome for a man of his age.",
