    "word": "This afternoon I received a letter from Willie. He seems to be of good courage. In his letter he asks whether Elder Haskell should remain longer in New York or go South. Elder Butler wants him to connect with him in the Southern field. I am in favor of Elder Haskell going to the South, and have written him a letter telling him this. I have been given a representation that makes it plain to me that as long as Elder J is in New York City he will see things in a perverted light and will create dissension, making it hard for Elder Haskell and his wife. Elder Haskell must have a respite from the strife, and he must be sustained in his labors. His wife also should be encouraged and sustained, for her labors are of great value, and she is a blessing and an encouragement to her husband.",
