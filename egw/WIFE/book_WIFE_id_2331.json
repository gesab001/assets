    "word": "Sorrow, deep sorrow, has his wife suffered, and if she cautioned her husband or warned him, it has fallen very lightly upon him. Sneeringly has he accused her of jealousy and of being faultfinding, when her heart was sore and aching as though it must burst. Hiram, guilt is upon your soul and a blot upon your life. Says the True Witness, \"I know thy works.\" All, all is noticed of God, passing in review before Him. He will judge for these things.",
