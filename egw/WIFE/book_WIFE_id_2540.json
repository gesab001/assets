    "word": "One of the Burnham girls has been a dressmaker, or rather the cutter of dresses, having many women in her establishment for whom she prepared work. She made forty dollars per week, but now she cannot obtain a situation. She would be glad to go to Battle Creek to school, but has not the means. The question may arise, If she has had the chance to earn so much, why is she destitute now? Her father was a wealthy man of business, but lost all his money. He might have taken the bankrupt law, but decided he could not do this, and if he did he would not be an honest man. He gave up everything but his wife. Had a little property in a house. It took part of this to settle the debts, and he stands before God as an honest man, but stripped of everything. He came down from one hundred thousand dollars to nothing.",
