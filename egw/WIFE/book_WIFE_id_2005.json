He is looking much better in health than when I saw him last, and his wife looks well. He had much to say in the short time he was with me, and he spoke clearly and distinctly. He always has a very interesting history to relate. He certainly is doing a good work. I hope he will be able to raise money for the place he has just purchased. How thankful I would have been if I could have given him something for this enterprise, but I was unable to do this.--Letter 62, 1908, p. 1. (To G. W. Reaser, Feb. 2, 1908.)",
