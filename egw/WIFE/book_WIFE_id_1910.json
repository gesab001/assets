    "word": "Brother Will Smith is a man that was converted last year. He was in the truth years ago, but for some reason gave it up, and the devil took \n\n\n                                   -151- \n\npossession of him, and he became a desperado. His wife kept the Sabbath. He is a tall, well developed, powerfully built man. He went into all sorts of lawlessness, stealing, and tried to kill, but his victim did not come in just when he was prepared to kill him. Last year at Fresno under the labors of Elder [E.P.] Daniels he was powerfully wrought upon, and he repented with another backslider who had gone with him in all his wickedness. Then commenced the work of confession and restitution. One man they went to see and met him in the road and down they went in the very dust and dirt on their knees, weeping and confessing, and the infidel wept like a child. \"Now,\" said they, \"We want you to forgive us, and we do not ask you not to arrest us for stealing your sheep, but we ask pardon; we will pay every cent of the cost of the sheep.\"",
