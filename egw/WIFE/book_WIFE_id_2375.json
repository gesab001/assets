    "word": "After this, just about the last interview we had with Dr. Maxson and wife, Sister Maxson stated that Sister Manch, Brother Rice's mother, told her all the circumstances of that one occasion of their lying on the bed together, and made it a very innocent, accidental affair. I said to Sister Maxson, I do not accept this statement, for I have had the matter from Sister Heald's lips. Everything shows that these parties, Brother and Sister Heald and Brother and Sister Maxson, and Elder Rice have been closely connected in bonds of sympathy, and when the board felt, for the prosperity of the institution, that Elder Rice must not officiate any longer, then all agreed to leave together, and did leave together. There has been some thought that they will unite together to start an institution on this coast, and this he has plainly stated in a letter to me that a wealthy man was urging them to do this and would help them. It is not improbable that Elder Rice may marry Dr. Maxson's niece.--Letter 53, 1888. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nApril 12, 1990. Entire Letter.",
