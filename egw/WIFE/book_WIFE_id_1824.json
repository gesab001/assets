    "word": "MR No. 202 - Counsel To The Wife of an Unbelieving Husband\n\n     We receive many letters soliciting advice. One mother says her husband is an unbeliever. She has children but they are taught by the father to disrespect the mother. She is deeply burdened for her children. She does not know what course she can pursue. She then expresses her anxiety to do something in the cause of God, and inquires whether I think she had a duty to leave her family if she is convinced she can do no good to them.",
