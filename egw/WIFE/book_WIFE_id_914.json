    "word": "The father in many cases, exercises less reason, and has less care, for his wife, and their offspring, before its birth, than he manifests for his cattle with young. The mother, in many cases previous to the birth of her children, is permitted to toil early and late, heating her blood, while preparing various unhealthy dishes of food to suit the perverted taste of the family, and of visitors. Her strength should have been tenderly cherished. A preparation of healthful food would have required but about one-half of the expense and labor, and would have been far more nourishing.",
