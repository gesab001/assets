    "word": "Edson, place yourself where Brother Shireman can have no cause for imagining that you mean to injure him. Arrange matters so that no suspicion shall rest upon you that you have been taking advantage of him. I know that you have been his true, disinterested, benevolent, tender-hearted friend and brother. Not one advantage would you knowingly take of him; but he imagines otherwise. I am sorry, so sorry that his soul and the soul of his wife are afflicted.",
