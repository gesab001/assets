    "word": "The general knowledge that your uncle has of mechanical work of all kinds is just the knowledge that the natives need. He can be an educator, and it is settled that they are to go. They leave New South Wales in one month in the company of Brother Cole, Brother Anderson and wife and little ones. For years \n\n\n                                  -128- \n\nBrother Belden and his wife have had a desire to go to the islands. Soon after we came here, they expressed a desire to go to Fiji, but I could not consent to their going because I knew that on account of its great heat it was a trying climate for Americans. I feel reconciled to their going to visit or reside in Norfolk Island, for they will there have an abundance of fruit and vegetables. They will not need money, for they could not use it if they had it. Your uncle's mechanical genius will be exactly what they will need, and he can exchange work for provisions. He will be able also to raise vegetables so that he can have an abundance without being obliged to toil very hard. I shall furnish them with clothing that will last them for some time, for wearing apparel is hard to procure on the island. A strong desire has been expressed that Byron and Sarah Belden should go to Lord Howe Island. This island is halfway between Sydney and Norfolk Island. I am not willing that Byron shall go there. It is necessary that he become a strong and able worker, and he is needed in other localities. We shall miss Brother and Sister Belden very much, but if they can become missionaries to the islands of the sea, I shall not hold them back one moment.--Letter 84, 1894, pp. 1,2. (To Edson and Emma White, November 14, 1894.)",
