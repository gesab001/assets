    "word": "Men and women, you will one day learn what is lust, and the result of its gratification. Passion may be found of just as base a quality in the marriage relation as outside of it. The apostle Paul exhorts husbands to love \n                                                                           54\ntheir wives \"even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.\" \"So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church.\" It is not pure love which actuates a man to make his wife an instrument to administer to his lust. It is the animal passions which clamor for indulgence. How few men show their love in the manner specified by the apostle: \"Even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it, that he might [not pollute it, but] sanctify and cleanse it,\" \"that it should be holy and without blemish.\" This is the quality of love in the married relation which God recognizes as holy. Love is a pure and holy principle. Lustful passion will not admit of restraint, and will not be dictated or controlled by reason. It is blind to consequences. It will not reason from cause to effect. Many women are suffering from great debility, and with settled disease, brought upon them because the laws of their being were not regarded. Nature's laws were trampled upon. The brain nerve-power is squandered by men and women because called into unnatural action to gratify base passions, and this hideous monster, base, low passion, assumes the delicate name of love.",
