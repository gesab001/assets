Smith, Leon Smith, Olsen, Fero, Watt, Prescott, Waggoner, McCoy, Larson, Porter, Colcord, Ballenger, Webber, Dan Jones, Wakeham, G. Amadon, Eldridge, Breed, and Prof. Miller. After prayer by Brother Smith, I said that Brother Waggoner had some things to say which I wished them to hear, which would disabuse some minds. He then took up the Sabbath School lessons, explaining the last lessons and the imputation that rested upon him as though it was done designedly. This, with Brother Jones' explanations, took about one hour. All had liberty to speak as they saw fit, asking any questions. All these things seemed to be satisfactory.",
