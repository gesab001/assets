    "word": "We returned to my home, about three quarters of a mile, took the two babies, Henry and Herbert White, and Sara and I rode in the country about five miles to Martinsville to purchase corn. We went to Mr. Smith's. We had a very pleasant visit with his wife and his daughter. They were very much delighted to see the twins trotting over the oilcloth floor. Mr. Smith had no corn to sell.
