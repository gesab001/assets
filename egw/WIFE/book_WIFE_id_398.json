    "word": "Husband and Wife Physicians Work Together Effectively.--In the medical missionary work to be done, women should give treatment to women.  A man and his wife who are both physicians can accomplish great good by laboring together.  The wife can visit other women, and when she finds suffering and disease, she can consult with her husband as to the best method of helping the sufferers.  We should have more women physicians than we have.  When women who are sick are treated and cared for by women, a door through which Satan tries to enter is closed against him.  Many cases have been presented to me where Satan has entered through this door to ruin families.  Let him not obtain any advantage upon any point.",
