    "word": "MR No. 912 - Counsel Regarding Ghost Writers\n\n     Edson, do not, I beg of you, write books and get this one and that one to write them for you, and then sign your name to them, even if you say these men have helped you. It hurts you as an author. You can write in simplifying the truth, but do not engage any man or woman to write for you. With close application you can read the Scriptures and make the thoughts your own. The Lord will help you if you will only take time for careful study. You have ideas; do not employ others to put their fingers and brains into the work. We want you here to plan on books. Come right along [to Australia] as soon as possible and escape the hard winter. I want you to take this matter to the Lord yourself, and pray about it. The Lord will teach all who seek Him earnestly.--Letter 240, 1899. (To J. E. White and wife, July 30, 1899.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. February 7, 1982",
