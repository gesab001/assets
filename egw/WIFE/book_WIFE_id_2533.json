    "word": "I have Garmire to meet and I have put everything in writing so that he cannot misstate me. He has a fine family of children, very bright, good looking, and well behaved. These children think everything of Sister White and I want to save them if possible, but Garmire is a zealous worker, seems to be honest, seems to want to be right. Then comes in Parmalee and his wife and Sister Marks. They want to get a house here in Petoskey. I hope they will not do so, although I have no genuine evidence that Sister Marks is not a child of God and seeking to do the will of God.",
