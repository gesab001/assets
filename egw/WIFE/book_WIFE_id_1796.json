    "word": "\"Shoulder Your Cross\"--\"Show Yourself a Man\" \n     I cannot see what more can be done in this case, and I think that the only thing that you can do is to give up your wife.

And as she has fully and determinedly set her stakes you can only shoulder your cross and show yourself a man. Letter 40, 1888, p. 1. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D.C. August 22, 1948",
