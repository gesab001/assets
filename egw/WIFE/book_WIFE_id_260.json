    "word": "Affection may be as clear as crystal and beauteous in its purity, yet it may be shallow because it has not been tested and tried. Make Christ first and last and best in everything. Constantly behold Him, and your love for Him will daily become deeper and stronger as it is submitted to the test of trial. And as your love for Him increases, your love for each other will grow deeper and stronger. \"We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory.\" 2 Corinthians 3:18. You now have duties to perform that before your marriage you did not have. \"Put on therefore, . . . kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering.\" Walk in \n127\nlove, as Christ also hath loved us.\" Give careful study to the following instruction: Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church. . . . Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it.\" Colossians 3:12; Ephesians 5:2, 22-25.",
