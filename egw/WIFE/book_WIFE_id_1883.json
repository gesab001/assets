    "word": "I do think we should have an institution in Michigan to which our Sabbathkeeping invalids can resort. Dr. Lay is doing well. He is in the very best place he could be in to learn. He is studying all his leisure moments and is coming out a thorough convert. His wife is doing well. She is gaining, walks well for her. She is one hundred percent better than when she came here. Dr. Lay is respected in this institution. He ranks among their physicians. I think they [would] be unwilling to have them leave. Dr. Lay thinks some of going to New York City to Dr. Trall's college to attend lectures, obtain a diploma, and come out a regular M.D. I believe the Lord's hand is in our coming to this place. We shall learn all we can and try to make a right use of it.",
