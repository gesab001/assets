    "word": "I would be glad to see a large work developed in Redlands. This is a most beautiful city, and additional efforts must be put forth there. Brother E. S. Ballenger lives there, and we spent several days with him and his wife at their home. I was able to speak to our people in Redlands on Sabbath morning. I spoke in the tasteful little church building that was built last spring, and as I stood in it I was in anticipation making an addition to it. If Redlands is worked as it should be, a larger church building will be required. And I wish that a small sanitarium could be started there.",
