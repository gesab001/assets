    "word": "At the different places which I have visited lately I have gathered some money for your work. I wish you would send me the amount you have received, so that if all has not been sent, I may write in regard to it. In every meeting we have attended there have been necessities that had to be met, and sometimes so many calls were made that I hardly dared to put in my plea. Nevertheless I will do my best to help you. I might hire money or perhaps get the loan of some without interest. Keep me informed as to your work.--Letter 62, 1901, p. 1. (To J. E. White and wife, June 26, 1901.)",
