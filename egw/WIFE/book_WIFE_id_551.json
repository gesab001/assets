    "word": "Notes of Travel.\nBy Mrs. E. G. White\n\nFrom California to Switzerland\n     July 13, 1885, in company with W. C. White and his wife, and Sister Sarah McEnterfer, I left California on my long-contemplated journey to Europe. For months I had looked forward to this journey with anything but pleasure. To travel across the continent in the heat of summer and in my feeble state of health, seemed almost presumptuous. Since attending the State camp-meetings in 1884, I had suffered great mental weariness and physical debility. For months at a time I had been able to write but very little. As the appointed time for us to go drew near, my faith was severely tested. I so much desired some one of experience upon whom I could rely for counsel and encouragement. My courage was gone, and I longed for human help, one who had a firm hold from above, and whose faith would stimulate mine. By day and by night my prayers ascended to heaven that I might know the will of God and have perfect submission to it. Still my way was not made clear; I had no special evidence that I was in the path of duty or that my prayers had been heard.",
