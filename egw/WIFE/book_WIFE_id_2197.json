    "word": "MR No. 1105 - Counsel to M. E. Cady and Members of the Healdsburg College Board\n\n     M. E. Cady Not to Serve as Adviser to His Successor. (Written to M. E. Cady, September 2, 1903, from \"Elmshaven,\" Sanitarium, California.) I wrote something in regard to you, the night after you left Healdsburg. Matters were opened before me, and I was instructed that you were correct in your statement to me that it would not be best to have two families serving in the same office of responsibility in the Students' Home. If Brother Sharpe and his wife should come in to serve in the place formerly occupied by yourself and wife, while you remained as an adviser, confusion would be liable to result.",
