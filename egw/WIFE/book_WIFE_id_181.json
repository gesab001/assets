    "word": "In a vision of the night, in his home in Beersheba, when he was one hundred and twenty years old, Abraham received the startling command, \u201cTake now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\u201d His son, his only son, the son of promise, to be sacrificed. There was no more sleep for Abraham that night. . . . God had promised him that his name was to be perpetuated in Isaac, but here was a severe trial of his faith. Abraham had clung to the promise of a son from his own wife Sarah, and God had fulfilled His promise. . . . He left Ishmael out of the question, saying, \u201cThine only son, Isaac.\u201d. . .",
