    "word": "\"There are very many girls who are married and have families who have but little practical knowledge of the duties devolving upon a wife and mother. They can read, and play upon an instrument of music; but they cannot cook. They cannot make good bread, which is very essential to the health of the family. They cannot cut and make garments, for they have never learned how. . . . It is this inexcusable ignorance in regard to the most needful duties of life which makes very many unhappy families.\"--Counsels, pp. 289, 290.",
