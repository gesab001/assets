    "word": "Brother [S. N.] Haskell has left us for a week or two to visit Adelaide. We deemed it advisable for him to go. His wife has remained to prepare matters for the opening of the school. We thought, as Brother Haskell had ordained both Brethren McCullagh and Hawkins, that he might possibly save these poor deluded men. He left us last Wednesday. At this time Brother Hare was in Sydney, procuring doors and necessary articles for the second building. He came back on Thursday, and was very much discouraged when he found that Brother Haskell had gone.--Letter 152, 1897, pp. 1,2. (To Edson, Emma, and Willie White, April 6, 1897.)",
