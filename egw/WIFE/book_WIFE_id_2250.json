    "word": "Now, my brother, Cecelia has not moral strength to withstand an atmosphere of skepticism. The seeds of doubt have already been planted in her soul, and I consider her upon the very verge of ruin. Your wife has not faith. She has cherished unbelief and questioning. If the husbandman sows corn, he reaps corn; if he sows thistles and weeds, he shall reap thistles and weeds. If we sow the corruptible, we shall reap the corruptible; and if we sow the imperishable, we shall reap the imperishable. The seed sown produces the harvest.",
