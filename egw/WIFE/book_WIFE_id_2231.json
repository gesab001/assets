    "word": "We met Elders Bourdeau and their wives, Elder Whitney and wife, and Brother Kellogg. We were to consider the matter of Brother A. C. going to Torre Pellice, Italy, to commence a work there. We told them that this work would move slowly at first, but if they labored in wisdom souls would be converted. When one or two souls were converted they would begin to labor for others, and there would be an army for the Lord raised up in that place. There are quite a number of places in the valley, and if they made a beginning the work would spread through all these places. Many honest souls were buried up in the rubbish of superstition and erroneous doctrines, which they received from their preachers, who educate the people to look to them as if they were the true teachers of righteousness.",
