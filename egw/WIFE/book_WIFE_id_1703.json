    "word": "Rulers and law-makers are not ignorant of the misery and degradation, the horrible and unceasing crime, that pollute the world through the influence of the liquor traffic. But though they are not ignorant, they do not take measures to stop the terrible traffic; but shall they escape judgment? \"Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?\" God will require for all this at the hand of him who has helped to speed the drunkard on the way to ruin. \"The destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together.\" Those who legalise the liquor traffic, and those who make gain by it, and those who are defiled through strong drink, shall be destroyed together. Let not the man who indulges in drink think that he will be able to cover his defilement by casting the blame upon the liquor-dealer; for his own sin for the degradation of his wife and children, he will have to answer. \"They that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.\" Isaiah 1:28.",
