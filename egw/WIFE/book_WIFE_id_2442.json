    "word": "I was consulting with Brother Prescott about the case of Brother J, who was unable to pay his quarterly rent of three pounds. I told Brother Prescott that I must have the remuneration for my past year's labor else I would be brought into very miserable circumstances. \"Here,\" said I, \"is three pounds that we must raise for this poor family. They ask it as a loan, but they will be no better able to pay the next quarterly rent than they are now. This means a gift. I have done this before and it is our duty to do it again.\" Well, before Professor Prescott left Cooranbong he sent me three pounds, one from himself, one from his wife, and one from Grace Prescott. I was relieved, for I could see no possibility of procuring the money.",
