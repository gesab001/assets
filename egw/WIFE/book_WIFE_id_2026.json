    "word": "We have not in any place had a more appreciative audience. Twenty-one were baptized last week, and several more are convinced of the truth, but \n\n\n                                    -350- \n\nare not fully decided. Sister James's two brothers' families, living in Adelaide, have been very much opposed, the children especially. Her sister kept the Sabbath alone twelve months. She was bitterly opposed by her eldest daughter, who took the liberty to cut off all communication to the mother from her friends by burning books and papers sent to her to strengthen her faith. But since the meeting in Adelaide commenced, there has been a change in their feelings. The son and the son's wife embraced the truth as the result of the Brighton camp meeting. None of the James family could go to Adelaide but the daughter-in-law; and the meeting has been a great blessing to her. She has identified herself now decidedly, and received baptism. She has good mental powers, has taken notes of the discourses and used them in the families of the sister and brothers of Sister James. She has influenced them to attend the meetings. The children are now grown-up young men and women, and these notes taken have been copied and the Scripture references made a matter of study. The daughters that opposed their mother so bitterly, burning her books and papers, have made a confession to her aunt, Sister James, where we now are making our home. Sister James is much rejoiced. We think the sister that was overcome with so great opposition will take the Sabbath again. She is a widow, but in good circumstances in life. The daughter-in-law from Ballarat and the aunt, the sister of Sister James, came to the cars to see us. We were much pleased with her appearance.",
