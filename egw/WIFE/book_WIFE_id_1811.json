    "word": "April 27. We have another beautiful morning. The snow-covered Alps look beautiful with the sun resting upon them. Brother Bourdeau, Brother Geymet, W. C. White and his wife, and I started, some on foot and some in a carriage, to ascend the mountains to Angrogna. We went up and up. We had a strong horse and carriage, but much of the way I was the only one in the carriage. This is the most striking scenery we have yet seen. It resembles Colorado very much in its wild rocky mountains, precipices, gulches, deep ravines, and very narrow valleys. These mountains of so great height are cultivated to the very summit. Dwellings are like nests, glued to the mountainsides, and houses are built upon the tops of the mountains. There are three villages in this mountainous place.",
