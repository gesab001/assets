    "word": "I was shown the cases of Bro. George Gaskill and his wife. Bro. George has good desires, but follows impulse too much. He does not move from principle, but from feeling. He needs a more thorough experience in the things of God, then will he be established, strengthened, settled. His character has been too changeable, his faith, wavering. His desires are strong enough, but he does not educate his mind to firmness of purpose. Disease has been upon him, which has been a great drawback to him, and has had an influence to becloud his intellect, that he has not clear perceptions of the exalted character of the work and truth of God. He should avoid being much in the society of unbelievers. He should come out \n                                                                           4\nfrom among them, and be separate, and the promise is, God will receive him, and will be a Father unto him. He should seek to be in the society of those who are the most spiritual, and should seek to be benefited with their light, and strengthened by their influence. Before he is aware of it, when in the society of unbelievers, he is partaking of their spirit, thinking as they think, and acting as they act. This is all wrong. He should plant his feet firmly on the platform of eternal truth, and be strong in the strength of God. Then will he have strength to exert a good influence over others. Then, instead of being borne down by the unbelief and darkness of others, when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him. He too frequently goes upon the enemy's battle field unarmed. He should not be there at all, but he realizes not his weakness, and walks right into danger without the armor on. He is kept in a state of continual weakness, when he might be growing in grace, and in the knowledge of the truth.",
