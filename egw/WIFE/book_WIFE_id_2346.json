    "word": "Walling's Mills, Sabbath, September 13, 1873. We arose early and walked out to have a private prayer in the grove. We feel perplexed to know just what is our duty. We decided to write to Mr. Walling to defer going to the Park until we could \n\n\n                                     -208- \n\nhear from Eli Glover. We depend upon him and his wife to keep our house while Brother Glover accompanies us on the trip to the Park. I wrote some upon life of Christ for Instructor. We had an early season of prayer. Willie rode on horseback to Black Hawk post office. Did not return until half past nine o'clock. He got half of the Review and one letter from Brother Uriah Smith. We were rejoiced to read its contents. He confesses his wrong course the few months past. If the scales are falling from his eyes, we praise God.",
