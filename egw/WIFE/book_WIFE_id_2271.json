    "word": "\"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, March 20, 1899. \n     Home again. I bore my testimony on Sunday to a goodly congregation. On Sabbath there sat in the meeting with his wife and family a man who two weeks before had cursed his wife because she decided to be baptized. Afterwards he told Brother Starr that he was ashamed of himself. We think that he will obey the truth and himself be baptized. We hope the Lord will open the way for him.",
