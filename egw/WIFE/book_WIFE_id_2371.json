I. Butler.) \n\n\n     Yesterday I had the pleasure of hearing W.C.W. read your good letter to him in reference to many important matters. There is one matter I wish particularly to notice--that is the subject of Dr. Gibbs in connection with Dr. Maxson. You know that he has resigned his position at the Health Retreat, and this will make it necessary for some facts to be presented before you and the Sanitarium at Battle Creek. I can feel that there is a determined purpose, whether Dr. Maxson and his wife are aware of it or not, to misinterpret and misunderstand Dr. Gibbs's method of practice; and notwithstanding I have plainly presented before Dr. Maxson that he certainly views matters in a wrong or incorrect light, yet this makes not a whit of difference with his ideas and plans of action.",
