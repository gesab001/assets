    "word": "Distant conferences should not be compelled to depend upon Battle Creek to manage for them. In every country men should be appointed to assist the presidents of the different conferences. The carrying forward of the message should be entrusted to willing men--men who, in the fear of God, will minister in His service. As these men do their best, according to their ability, working with a deep, earnest love for the souls for whom Christ has died, God will help them.--Letter 88, 1896, pp. 1, 2. (To W. W. Prescott and Wife, Sept. 1, 1896.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. July 20, 1981",
