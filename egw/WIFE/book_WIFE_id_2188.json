    "word": "In regard to divorce, I am not prepared to say. She has had all the light that I can give her, and it is useless to keep this matter constantly before her when she is perfectly decided to follow her own judgment. You asked me if I thought, if your wife left you, that you should marry again. I would say [that] if one understanding all the circumstances should choose to marry you, if you had not been married, I see no objections. But I am not fully prepared to give any judgment, whether in a Bible point of view you could marry again. [THE INDIVIDUAL ADDRESSED WAS A EUNUCH.] My mind is so fully occupied that it is not possible for me to consider this vexed question of marriage and divorces. I wish I could help you, but that, I fear, is not possible. \n\n\n                                   -297-",
