    "word": "Sister Edwards and I walked a short distance to call upon my sister Harriet's daughter, Emma McCann. She married Charlie Morrison. She is his second wife. His first wife was Mary McCann, her own sister. She left three children. All are married but one, whose name is Mabel. Emma was much pleased to see me. We visited her about two hours. In the afternoon Charlie Morrison, Emma's husband, came with his covered carriage for me to ride out. He took me to his sister's where his mother is staying. He introduced me to his mother and his two sisters. They received me courteously and the mother heartily. I had a little visit with them. I was glad to see Charlie's mother. She is a nice, sensible woman, plain, benevolent-looking, and wholesome. When we returned, the horse was afraid of the cars and we had to go a round-about way to get to Brother Edwards'. We were glad to retire early.",
