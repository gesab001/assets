    "word": "\"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, and He [referring to Christ], is the Saviour of the body,\" or church. Christ's rule is one of wisdom and love, and when husbands fulfill their obligations to their wives, they will use their authority with the same tenderness as Christ uses toward the church. When the Spirit of Christ controls the husband, the wife's subjection will only result in rest and benefit, for he will require from her only that which will result in good, and in the same way that Christ requires submission from the church.",
