{"word": "The brothers and sisters of Jesus were taught the multitudinous traditions and ceremonies of the rabbis, but Christ himself could not be induced to interest himself in these matters. While hearing on every hand the reiterated \"Thou shalt,\" and \"Thou shalt not,\" he moved independently of these restrictions. The requirements of society and the requirements of God were ever in collision; and while in his youth he made no direct attack upon the customs or precepts of the learned teachers, he did not become a student in their schools.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 161}
