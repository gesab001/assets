{"word": "The Old and the New Testament Scriptures need to be studied daily. The knowledge of God and the wisdom of God come to the student who is a constant learner of his ways and works. The Bible is to be our light, our educator. When we will acknowledge God in all our ways; when the youth are educated to believe that God sends the rain and the sunshine from heaven, causing vegetation to flourish; when they are taught that all blessings come from him, and that thanksgiving and praise are due to him; when with fidelity they acknowledge God, and discharge their duties day by day, God will be in all their thoughts; they can trust him for tomorrow, and that anxious care that brings unhappiness to so many lives, will be avoided. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" \n                                                                           15", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 14}
