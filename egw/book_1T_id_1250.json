    "word": "I was shown that this is the course which the believing young should take, but they do not; it is more congenial to their feelings to unite with the sinner in sport and pleasure. The young have a wide sphere of usefulness, but they see it not. Oh, that they would now exert their powers of mind in seeking ways to approach perishing sinners, that they might make known to them the path of holiness, and by prayer and entreaty win even one soul to Christ! What a noble enterprise! One soul to praise God through eternity! One soul to enjoy happiness and everlasting life! One gem in their crown to shine as a star for ever and ever! But even more than one can be brought to turn from error to truth, from sin to holiness. Says the Lord by the prophet: \"And they that turn many to righteousness [shall shine] as the stars for ever and ever.\" Then those who engage with Christ and angels in the work of saving perishing souls are richly rewarded in the kingdom of heaven.",
