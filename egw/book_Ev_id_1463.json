{"word": "There is not the least chance of getting into the little rough churches in the bush. We have been refused all chance to speak to the people in this way. But in the Lord's great temple, the open air--the heavens our dome, and the earth our floor--we can obtain hearers who otherwise would not hear. We feel intensely over the matter of lifting the standard of truth in these places. The people have no shepherd. The state church in Cooranbong stands locked week after week, and the people hear no preaching. We see that there is a great work to be done in out-of-the-way places in the open air. I have an appointment for such a meeting next Sunday afternoon at Dora Creek. We have now two places where these meetings are held.--Letter 79, 1899.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 427}
