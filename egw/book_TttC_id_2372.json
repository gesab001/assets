    "word": "Chap. 42 - Duties of the Husband and the Wife\n\n     Brother R: Last June your case was presented before me in vision. But I have been so constantly pressed with labor that I could not possibly write out the things shown me in regard to individual cases. I wish to write what I have to write, \n                                                                           297\nbefore I hear any account of matters in regard to your case; for Satan might suggest doubts to your mind. This is his work.",
