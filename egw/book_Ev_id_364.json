{"word": "The Fields in Your Neighborhood Are Ripe.--The truth will triumph gloriously. Let the churches begin to do the work that the Lord has given them-- the work of opening the Scriptures to those who are in darkness. My brethren and sisters, there are souls in your neighborhood who, if they were judiciously labored for, would be converted. Efforts must be made for those who do not understand the Word. Let those who profess to believe the truth become partakers of the divine nature, and then they will see that the fields are ripe for the work that all can do whose souls are prepared by living the Word.--Australasian Union Conference Record, March 11, 1907.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 114}
