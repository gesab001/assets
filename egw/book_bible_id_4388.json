{"word": "As a man soweth he shall also reap. All who study the Word with full purpose to cleanse away from the life all sin, and who search the Scriptures to learn what is truth, will welcome the truth of the Word as a Thus saith the Lord. They will repent under the sharp reproofs of Bible truth. . . . If a man sow true repentance he will reap the reward of sound good works. If he continues in the faith he reaps peace. If he becomes sanctified and cleansed from his appetite for cheapness and folly he shall . . . reap righteousness and perfect love. . . . A continuance in the well doing in overcoming makes him a daily victor because he keeps the mark of Christ's perfection ever before him.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 281}
