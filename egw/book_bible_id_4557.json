{"word": "We have been commissioned to go forth as God's missionaries. In the Bible we learn what work God has given us to do, and there, too, we learn how to do this work. No one can know the will of God so certainly as he who abides in Christ. There are some who are constantly inquiring and speculating and guessing, but who, instead of advancing, are retrograding. They are not united with Christ.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 190}
