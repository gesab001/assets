    "word": "We are living in an age when all should especially give heed to the injunction of the Saviour: \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.\" Let everyone bear in mind that he should be true and loyal to God, believing the truth, growing in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. The Saviour's invitation is: \"Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" The Lord is willing to help us, to strengthen and bless us; but we must pass through the refining process until all the impurities in our character are burned away. Every member of the church will be subjected to the furnace, not to consume, but to purify.",
