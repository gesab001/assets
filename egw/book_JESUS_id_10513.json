{"word": "That same Jesus who wrought those mighty works, is our Saviour today, and is as willing to manifest His power on our behalf as He was in the behalf of John the Baptist. When we are hedged about by adverse circumstances, surrounded by difficulties which it seems impossible for us to surmount, we are not to murmur, but to remember the past loving kindnesses of the Lord. Looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith, we may endure as seeing Him who is invisible, and this will keep our minds from being clouded by the shadow of unbelief.--Signs of the Times, Sept. 17, 1896.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 352}
