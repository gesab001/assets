{"word": "Jesus lives as your Advocate, your great High Priest. He is your representative before the Father in the courts of heaven. His mediation secures you everything that your faith claims. \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you\" (Matthew 7:7). Who has said it? The Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. He is your Saviour. Never will He fail to prove true to His word. Never will He falsify Himself. God hath promised. Let faith claim the promise.--Manuscript 24, Dec. 21, 1889, diary.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 364}
