{"word": "The Sabbath is the Lord's test, and no man, be he king, priest, or ruler, is authorized to come between God and man. Those who seek to be conscience for their fellow men, place themselves above God. Those who are under the influence of a false religion, who observe a spurious rest day, will set aside the most positive evidence in regard to the true Sabbath. They will try to compel men to obey the laws of their own creation, laws that are directly opposed to the law of God. . . . The law for the observance of the first day of the week is the production of an apostate Christendom. . . . In no case are God's people to pay it homage.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 59}
