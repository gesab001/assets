{"word": "God calls upon all who claim to be Christians to elevate the standard of righteousness, and to purify themselves even as He is pure. \"Be ye holy in all manner of conversation.\" \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above. . . . Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.\" \"Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance;\" for you are to walk in the light, while you have the light; \"but as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.\"--Letter 6a, 1890.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 147}
