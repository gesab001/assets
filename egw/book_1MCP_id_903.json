{"word": "Chap. 30 - Selfishness and Self-centeredness\n\n\n     By Nature We Are Self-centered.--Naturally we are self-centered and opinionated. But when we learn the lessons that Christ desires to teach us, we become partakers of His nature; henceforth we live His life. The wonderful example of Christ, the matchless tenderness with which He entered into the feelings of others, weeping with those who wept, rejoicing with those who rejoiced, must have a deep influence upon the character of all who follow Him in sincerity. By kindly words and acts they will try to make the path easy for weary feet.-- MH 157, 158 (1905).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 271}
