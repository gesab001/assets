{"word": "Chap. 9 - The Quality of Our Faith\n\nSERMON PREACHED BY ELLEN G. WHITE AT OTTAWA, KANSAS, ON SABBATH, MAY 11, 1889, JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE MINNEAPOLIS CONFERENCE, REPRESENTING HER SIMPLE, PRACTICAL PRESENTATION OF THE SUBJECT. ON FILE AS MANUSCRIPT 1, 1889. \n\nText: John 3:1-16 (read by the speaker) \n     If there is nothing more in all the Scriptures which point out definitely the way to heaven, we have it here in these words. They tell us what conversion is. They tell us what we must do in order to be saved. And, my friends, I want to tell you that this strikes directly at the root of the surface work in the religious world. It strikes directly against the idea that you can become a child of God without any particular change. There is a decided change wrought in us if the truth of God has found a place in our hearts, for it has a sanctifying power upon life and upon character. When we see the fruits of righteousness in those who claim to have advanced truth, as we claim to have it, then there will be a course of action which testifies that we have learned of Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 63}
