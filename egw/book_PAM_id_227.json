{"word": "Genuine love for Christ will lead directly to hearty obedience to all the law of God.--While men profess to rejoice in the intercession and grace of Jesus Christ they should not forget that harmony with Christ cannot be gained while there is a spirit of war in their hearts against his Father's commandments. Love genuine love to Jesus Christ will lead directly to hearty obedience of all the law of God, and there will be the deepest repentance whenever they break, or teach men by their example to break one of the least of God's commandments. Ministers who soothe the consciences of the people by participating with them in transgression through any cause, are rejoicing in iniquity. And when Christ comes, to judgment, the stoutest hearts, the most confident boasters of religious attainments while breaking the law of God, will faint and fail, every excuse will then be silenced, every heart corrupt in its disobedience will be revealed just as it is. There will be recriminations with the companions in pouring contempt upon the law of God; but the heaviest denunciations will come upon the unfaithful minister who professed to be sent of God to show them the way of salvation. Tempter and tempted will suffer condemnation according to their responsibility and the wrong that\n98\nthey have done in leading souls to transgression. Of all the crimes that God will visit none are in His sight so grievous as those who tempt and encourage others in sin. God would have His ministers ever in all places show themselves decidedly on the Lord's side, loyal and true to His commandments in a rebellious world, thus rebuking the disobedient however difficult or contrary to the natural feelings. \"Those that honor me,\" saith God, \"I will honor.\" God looks to those who bear His commission to be true and faithful, and to exalt the dignity of his claims.--ST May 20, 1880.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 97}
