God takes notice of you, unfaithful stewards; He will call you to account.

And those who should be wise heirs of salvation almost willingly let their Lord's money slip out of their hands into the enemy's ranks. In this way they strengthen Satan's kingdom, and seem to feel very easy about it! \n\n                                               -",
