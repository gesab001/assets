    "word": "When my husband's courage and hope began to waver, we could not benefit anyone at that place and could not be benefited by a further experience there. It was the will of God that my husband should not remain there shorn of his strength, but that in his state of weakness he should go among his brethren who could help him bear his afflictions. While separated from God's people in our affliction, we had an opportunity to reflect, to carefully review our past life, and see our mistakes and wrongs, and to humble ourselves before God and seek His face by confession, humility, and frequent, earnest prayer. While engaged in active labor, bearing the burdens of others, and pressed with many cares, it was impossible for us to find time to reflect and carefully review the past, and learn the lessons which God saw that it was necessary for us to learn. I was then shown that God could not glorify His name by answering the supplications of His people and raising my husband to health in answer to their prayers, while we were at -----. It would be like uniting His power with the power of darkness. Had He been pleased to manifest His power in restoring my husband, the physicians there would have taken the glory which should be given to God.",
