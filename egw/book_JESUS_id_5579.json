{"word": "We should make it our daily care to cultivate sympathy and affection for one another. This is the fruit that grows on the Christian tree; it does not produce the briers and thorns of hatred and strife. The harsh, unsympathetic words we sometimes hear spoken, and the hardheartedness we see manifested, are wholly satanic, and this spirit must be supplanted by the spirit of Christ. Jesus bids us, \\93Love one another, as I have loved you. . . . By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\\94 [John 13:34, 35.] He is our mighty Helper; and if he abides in our hearts, we shall manifest his spirit. We shall love one another; we cannot help it; for he is love.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 460}
