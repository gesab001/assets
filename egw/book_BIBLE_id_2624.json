{"word": "Chap. 74 - Doubts\n\n\n     Mysteries We Cannot Fathom.--The Word of God, like the character of its Divine Author, presents mysteries that can never be fully comprehended by finite beings. The entrance of sin into the world, the incarnation of Christ, regeneration, the resurrection, and many other subjects presented in the Bible are mysteries too deep for the human mind to explain, or even fully to comprehend. But we have no reason to doubt God's Word because we cannot understand the mysteries of His providence.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 671}
