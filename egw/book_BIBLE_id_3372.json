{"word": "But God's people are coming into the unity of the faith, and those who observe the Sabbath of the Bible are united in their views of bible truth. But those who oppose the Sabbath among the Advent people are disunited, and strangely divided.

But as his effort does not put the question to rest, and as the Sabbath cause progresses, and the children of the Lord embrace it still, another comes forward to overthrow it. But in presenting his views to get round the Sabbath, he entirely tears down the arguments of him who made the first effort against the truth, and presents a theory as opposite to his, as to ours.
