{"word": "The wives of ministers should live devoted, prayerful lives. But some would enjoy a religion in which \n213\nthere are no crosses, and which calls for no self-denial and exertion on their part. Instead of standing nobly for themselves, leaning upon God for strength, and bearing their individual responsibility, they have much of the time been dependent upon others, deriving their spiritual life from them. If they would only lean confidingly, in childlike trust, upon God, and have their affections centered in Jesus, deriving their life from Christ, the living vine, what an amount of good they might do, what a help they might be to others, what a support to their husbands, and what a reward would be theirs in the end! \\93Well done, good and faithful servants,\\94 would fall like sweetest music upon their ears. The words, \\93Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,\\94 would repay them a thousand times for all suffering and trials  endured to save precious souls.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 212}
