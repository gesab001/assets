    "word": "Chap. 98 - The \"Health Reformer\"\n\n     The people are perishing for want of knowledge. Says the apostle: \"Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge.\" After receiving the faith of the gospel, our first work is to seek to add virtuous and pure principles, and thus cleanse the mind and heart for the reception of true knowledge. Disease of almost every description is pressing upon the people, yet they seem willing to remain in ignorance of the means of relief and the course to pursue to avoid disease.",
