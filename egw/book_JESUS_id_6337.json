{"word": "A relentless and determined foe has prepared his wiles for every soul that is not braced for trial, and guarded by constant prayer and living faith. We cannot individually, or as a body, secure ourselves from his constant assaults; but in the strength of Jesus every temptation, every opposing influence, whether open or secret, may be successfully resisted. Remember that \\93your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.\\94 Therefore \\93be sober, be vigilant.\\94 \n     Wednesday morning, Sept. 23.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 136}
