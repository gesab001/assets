{"word": "The angel withdrew; the light faded away; Jesus was left standing, calm and self-possessed, with the bright beams of the moon upon his pale face, and still surrounded by prostrate, helpless men, while the disciples were too much amazed to utter a word. When the angel departed, the Roman soldiers started to their feet, and, with the priests and Judas, gathered about Christ as though ashamed of their weakness, and fearful that he would yet escape from their hands. Again the question was asked by the Redeemer, \"Whom seek ye?\" Again they answered, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" The Saviour then said, \"I have told you that I am he. If, therefore, ye seek me, let these go their way\"--pointing to the disciples. In this hour of humiliation Christ's thoughts were not for himself, but for his beloved disciples. He wished to save them from any farther trial of their strength.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 103}
