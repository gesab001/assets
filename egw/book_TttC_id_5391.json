    "word": "Every workman in the office should consider himself God's steward and should do his work with exactness and faithful vigilance. The constant inquiry should be: \"Is this in accordance with the will of God? Will this please my Redeemer?\" Bible religion elevates the reason until Christ is blended with all the thoughts. Every action, every word, and every moment of our lives should bear the impress of our holy faith. The end of all things is at hand, and we have no time to be idle or to live in pleasure, at cross-purposes with God.",
