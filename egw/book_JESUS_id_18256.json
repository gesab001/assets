{"word": "Brother A-----, you must cast away your fears. Leave consequences with the Lord and let go. You try too hard to save yourself, to do some great thing yourself which will commend you to God. All God requires of you, dear brother, is entire submission of yourself to Him with all the consequences that your acceptance of the whole truth involves. Satan says, \"What if it is error after all. Can you afford to run the risk?\" Jesus loves you, and if you will consecrate yourself and all that you have to Him, He will accept you and will be your Burden-bearer, your never-failing Friend.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 376}
