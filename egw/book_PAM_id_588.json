{"word": "Do not claim to be a miracle worker.--Multitudes have heard me speak, and have read my writings, but no one has ever heard me claim to work miracles. I have at times been called upon to pray for the sick, and the Word of the Lord has been verified: \"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.\" Christ is the great miracle-worker. To Him be all the glory.--19MR 372.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 233}
