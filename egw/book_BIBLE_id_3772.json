{"word": "An Effective Work in Uniting With Christian Temperance Workers.--Soon after my husband and I returned from California to Michigan in the spring of 1877, we were earnestly solicited to take part in a temperance mass meeting, a very praiseworthy effort in progress among the better portion of the citizens of Battle Creek. This movement embraced the Battle Creek Reform Club, six hundred strong, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, two hundred and sixty strong. God, Christ, and Holy Spirit, and the Bible were familiar words with these earnest workers. Much good had \n                                                                           221\nalready been accomplished, and the activity of the workers, the system by which they labored, and the spirit of their meetings, promised greater good in time to come. . . .", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 220}
