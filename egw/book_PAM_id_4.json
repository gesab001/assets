{"word": "A LARGE PORTION OF MRS. WHITE'S WRITINGS ARE ANECDOTAL; THAT IS, THEY ARE ACCOUNTS OF EVENTS THAT HAPPENED IN HER LIFE, THE LIFE OF ANOTHER PERSON, OR THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH. PRINCIPLES ARE SET FORTH, BUT OFTEN INDIRECTLY. TO FIND THESE PRINCIPLE REQUIRES MORE EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE READER THAN WOULD BE NECESSARY IF THE WRITINGS WERE STRAIGHTFORWARD ESSAYS. HOWEVER, THIS STYLE MAKES INTERESTING READING, AND MAKES CLEAR THE FACT THAT ELLEN WHITE'S WORK FOR THE CHURCH WAS A HANDS-ON WORK.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 13}
