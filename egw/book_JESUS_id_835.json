{"word": "The condition of the world previous to the first appearing of Christ is a picture of the condition of the world just previous to His second advent. The same iniquity will exist; Satan manifests the same delusive power upon human minds. . . . He is securing his army of human agents to engage in the last conflict against the Prince of life, to overthrow the law of God, which is the foundation of His throne. Satan will work with miraculous presentations to confirm people in the belief that he is what he claims to be\\97the prince of this world\\97and that victory is his. He will turn his forces against those who are loyal to God; but though he may cause pain, distress, and human agony, he cannot defile the soul. . . . The people of God in these last days must expect to enter into the thick of the conflict, for the prophetic Word says, \\93The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\\94Letter 43, 1895 (Review and Herald, Oct. 29, 1895).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 259}
