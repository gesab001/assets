    "word": "Other women were shown me in-----who were at war with the truth. One was presented before me who embraced a few points of truth, and then went no further with God's remnant people. She was exalted in her own eyes, and \n                                                                           331\nthought she understood it all. She was wise in her own opinion, and was shown me as constantly looking back and referring to an old experience; because she had received a degree of light in the past, she had become lifted up, and thought she had sufficient light and knowledge to instruct the whole body. Her faith is scattered and disconnected. Many of her ideas of truth are erroneous; yet she is egotistical, and righteous in her own estimation. She is forward to instruct, but will not be taught. She has despised instruction, and cast behind her the teachings of God through His servants. I saw her pointing to her righteousness, her devotion, her prayerful life. Like the Pharisee, she enumerates her good deeds. \"God, I thank Thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\" The Pharisee's prayer was not regarded; but the poor publican, who could only say, \"God be merciful to me a sinner,\" moved the pity of the Lord. His prayer was accepted, while the prayer of the boasting Pharisee was rejected. \"For everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\"",
