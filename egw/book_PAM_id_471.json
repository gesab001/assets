{"word": "Christ-centered\n \n\n     Study, and learn of Jesus.--The minister of the gospel is never exhorted to strive to be a smart preacher, a popular speaker, but is commanded to \"study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.\" Will every messenger of God give heed to these words? We are laborers together with God, and if those who accept the responsibility of holding forth the Word of life to others do not daily yoke up with Christ, and lift His burdens, and learn of Jesus day by day; it were better for them to seek some other employment.--TDG 119.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 190}
