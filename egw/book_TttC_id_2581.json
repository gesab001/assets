    "word": "It is a great responsibility to take the life of a human being in hand. And to have that precious life sacrificed through mismanagement is dreadful. The case of Brother D's family is terrible. These men may excuse their course; but that will not save the cause of God from reproach, nor bring back that son who suffered and died for the want of food. A little good wine and food would have brought him up from a bed of death and given him back to his family. The father also would soon have been numbered with the dead if the same course had been continued which had been pursued toward the son, but the presence and timely counsel of a doctor from the Health Institute saved him.",
