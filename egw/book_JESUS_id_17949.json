{"word": "Jesus appreciates the efforts of every tried and tempted soul. Please take in the precious words of invitation that have been spoken to you by Jesus. Christ alone can place a proper estimate upon the human soul. Those who strive for the crown of immortal life will find that the forces of Satan are arrayed against them, but remember that we are \"kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time\" (1 Peter 1:5). We are living in the last time, and Satan is now working with masterly power in order that with subtle temptations he may overcome those who believe in Jesus. But we are to be \"kept by the power of God\"; therefore, in temptation give glory to God who is able and will keep the believing soul so that he shall not be overcome by the wily foe. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 42}
