{"word": "\"Without me,\" Christ says, \"ye can do nothing.\" [John 15:5.] Our faith, our example, must be held more sacred than they have been held in the past. The word of God must be studied as never before; for it is the precious offering that we must present to men, in order that they may learn the way of peace, and obtain that life which measures with the life of God. Human wisdom so highly exalted among men sinks into insignificance before that wisdom which points out the way cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in. The Bible alone affords the means of distinguishing the path of life from the broad road that leads to perdition and death.--Review and Herald, Dec. 15, 1891. \n\n                                               -", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CE", "page": 98}
