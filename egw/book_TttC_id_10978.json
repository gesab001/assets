    "word": "Instruction to Workers \n\n     Slowly but surely the wheel of Providence is turning. We know not how soon our Lord will say: \"It is done.\" His coming is drawing nigh. Soon our opportunities for work will be forever past. Only a little while longer shall we be permitted to labor. My brethren, will you not strive with earnest effort to establish memorials for God throughout the Southern States? Churches should be raised up; houses of worship should be built; small schools and sanitariums should be established; and the publishing interests should be strengthened.",
