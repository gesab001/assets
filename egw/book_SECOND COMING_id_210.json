{"word": "One of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed in the Bible is that of Christ\\92s second coming, to complete the great work of redemption. To God\\92s pilgrim people, so long left to sojourn in \\93the region and shadow of death,\\94 a precious, joy-inspiring hope is given in the promise of His appearing, who is \\93the resurrection and the life,\\94 to \\93bring home again His banished.\\94 The doctrine of the second advent is the very key-note of the Sacred Scriptures. From the day when the first pair turned their sorrowing steps from Eden, the children of faith have waited the coming of the Promised One to break the destroyer\\92s power and bring them again to the lost Paradise. ... Enoch, only the seventh in descent from them that dwelt in Eden, he who for three centuries on earth walked with his God, was permitted to behold from afar the coming of the Deliverer. \\93Behold,\\94 he declared, \\93the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all.\\94 The patriarch Job in the night of his affliction exclaimed with unshaken trust: \\93I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:...in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.\\94", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 315}
