{"word": "God's Approval Won \n\n     The Lord regarded with approval the firmness and self-denial of these Hebrew youth, and His blessing attended them. He \"gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.\" At the expiration of the three years of training, \n                                                                           32\nwhen their ability and acquirements were tested by the king, he \"found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the king. And in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king required of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 31}
