{"word": "Chap. 12 - Heart Work in Sabbath-School Teacher and Scholar\n\n     Every teacher in the Sabbath-school should be a follower of Christ, and those who have not identified themselves as the disciples of Christ, showing by a consistent life that they are Christians, should not be invited to become teachers in the Sabbath-school, for they have need that some one first teach them the foundation principles of the love and fear of God. \\93Without Me,\\94 Christ says, \\93ye can do nothing.\\94 Then of what value would be the teaching of one who knew nothing by personal experience of the power of Christ? It would be a great inconsistency to urge such a one to take a class in the Sabbath-school, but it is even worse to permit a class to be under the influence of a teacher whose dress and deportment deny the Saviour, whom they profess to serve.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 54}
