{"word": "Disease Sometimes Produced by Imagination. [SEE CHAPTER 75, \"IMAGINATION AND ILLNESS.\"]--Disease is sometimes produced and is often greatly aggravated by the imagination.

Many die from disease the cause of which is wholly imaginary.--MH 241 (1905).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 588}
