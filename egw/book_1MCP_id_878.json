{"word": "(B) Dependence and Independence in \n                   Working Relationships \n\n\n     One Man's Mind.--It is a mistake to make men believe that the workers for Christ should make no move save that which has first been brought before some responsible man. Men must not be educated to look to men as to God. While it is necessary that there be a counseling together and a unity of action among the laborers, one man's mind and one man's judgment must not be the controlling power.--RH, Aug 7, 1894.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 263}
