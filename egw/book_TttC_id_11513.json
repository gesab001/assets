Had they remembered His wondrous dealings with them they would not have received the reproof: \n\n     \"Who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die, \n     And of the son of man that shall be made as grass; \n     And hast forgotten Jehovah thy Maker, \n     That stretched forth the heavens, \n     And laid the foundations of the earth; \n     And fearest continually all the day \n     Because of the fury of the oppressor, \n     When he maketh ready to destroy? \n     And where is the fury of the oppressor?\" \n                                     Isaiah 51:12, 13, A.
