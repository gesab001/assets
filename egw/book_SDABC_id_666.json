    "word": "2 (2 Chronicles 34:30). Josiah's View of His Highest Position.--To be a reader of the Book of the law, containing a \"Thus saith the Lord,\" Josiah regarded as the highest position that he could occupy. . . . The highest work of princes in Israel,--of physicians, of teachers in our schools, as well as of ministers and those who are in positions of trust in the Lord's institutions,--is to fulfill the responsibility resting upon them to fasten the Scriptures in the minds of the people as a nail in a sure place, to use their God-given talent of influence to impress the truth that \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" For the leaders in Israel to extend a knowledge of the Scriptures in all their borders is to promote spiritual health; for God's Word is a leaf from the tree of life (MS 14, 1903).",
