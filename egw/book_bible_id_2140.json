{"word": "If the Bible is not made the rule of life, our hereditary and cultivated habits and tastes will ensnare the soul. . . . The soul is of value, and is regarded by God as more precious than gold, even the golden wedge of Ophir. Christ has given us the estimate He places upon the human soul. Look at His humiliation, His sufferings, His death. Had He studied His pleasure, His choice, His convenience, He would never have left the royal courts of heaven. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 170}
