{"word": "In the parable [Matthew 18:32] the Lord summoned the unmerciful debtor, and \\93said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me; shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.\\94 \\93So likewise,\\94 said Jesus, \\93shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\\94 Those who refuse to forgive are thereby casting away their own hope of pardon.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 186}
