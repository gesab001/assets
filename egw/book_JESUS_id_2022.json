{"word": "The Way, the Truth, and the Life will be clearly revealed in the words, the spirit, and the deportment of those who believe in and learn of Jesus. Parents and teachers should manifest the tenderest interest and sympathy for those who are not believers in the truth. They should never, either by word or action, wound a soul, the purchase of Christ's blood. If the older ones manifest a cold, harsh, unsympathetic spirit, the children will manifest the same, and their characters will not be molded after the divine model. We must patiently educate the children and youth to feel that they are required of God to be missionaries, that they are not to be selfish, narrow, and bigoted, but broad in their ideas and sympathies. If \n                                                                           86\nall work in love and manifest Christian courtesy, they will be winners of souls, and will bring precious sheaves to the Master.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 85}
