{"word": "Self to the Background--In the first chapter of Corinthians, Paul has given us instruction which every true laborer needs to study, especially the following verses: \"But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men\" [1 Corinthians 1:23-25]. Here is a lesson of special consequence to every worker in the vineyard of the Lord. It will not result in solid work for men to preach to please the ears of the people, while the truth is not held forth in a manner to bring them to the cross of Jesus Christ. The messenger of God must present eternal truths plainly, and keep in distinct view before the people their peril in neglecting eternal interests. While self is kept out of sight Jesus Christ must be ever lifted up and exalted.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 322}
