    "word": "\"If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\" There was a point of time in the experience of such, when the light given them was not cherished, and it became darkness. Said the angel: \"Ye cannot love and worship the treasures of earth, and have the true riches.\" When the young man came to Jesus and said to Him, \"Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\" Jesus gave him his choice, to part with his possessions and have eternal life, or retain them and lose it. His riches were of greater value to him than the heavenly treasure. The condition that he must part with his treasures and give to the poor in order to become a follower of Christ and have eternal life, chilled his desire; and he went away sorrowful.",
