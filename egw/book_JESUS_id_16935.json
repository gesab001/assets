{"word": "We should keep our minds upon the love, the mercy, and the graciousness of our God. . . . It is no sign that Jesus has ceased to love us because we experience doubts and discouragements. Affliction comes to us in the providence of God in order that we may see that Christ is our helper, that in Him is love and consolation. We may receive grace whereby we may be overcomers and inherit the life that measures with the life of God. We must have such an experience that when affliction comes upon us we shall not depart from the faith. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 278}
