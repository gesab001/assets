{"word": "Can we be surprised, then, that Christ, who made all things, should choose the open air as His sanctuary; that He should desire to be surrounded by the works of His creation? . . . Jesus drew His lessons of spiritual instruction from the natural things with which His hearers were familiar. These He used to represent the truth. He would pluck the lilies, the flower of the valley, and place them in the hands of the little children, and by these simple instructors proclaim the truth of His Word. The Word of God and the things of nature around us are our lesson book. God has spread out before our senses the beauties of nature, and He watches with pleasure and a Father's joy the delight of His children in the beautiful things around them.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 98}
