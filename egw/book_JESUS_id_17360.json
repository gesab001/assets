{"word": "Then why should not the followers of Jesus walk in His light, reflecting the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness? They may do this. Christ has enjoined upon them to do this, and He makes it possible for them to do this, for He would never enjoin them to do that which it is not possible for them to do. What is possible should be done, not only for their own happiness and peace, but for the good of the world.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 364}
