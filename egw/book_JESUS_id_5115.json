{"word": "Forgetting the things that are behind, let us press forward in the heavenward way. Let us neglect no opportunity that, if improved, will make us more useful in God's service. Then like threads of gold, holiness will run through our lives, and the angels, beholding our consecration, will repeat the promise, \"I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir\" (Isaiah 13:12). All heaven rejoices when weak, faulty human beings give themselves to Jesus, to live His life.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 120}
