{"word": "The Holiness of God\n     May 14th, 1851, I saw the beauty and loveliness of Jesus. As I beheld his glory the thought did not occur to me that I should ever be separated from his presence. I saw a light coming from the glory that encircled the Father, and as it approached near to me, my body trembled and shook like a leaf. I thought if it should come near to me I should be struck out of existence; but the light past me. Then could I have some sense of the great and terrible God that we have to do with. Then I saw what faint views some have of the holiness of God, and how much they take his holy and reverend name in vain, without realizing that it was God, the great and terrible God, they were speaking of. I have seen that many, while praying, used careless and irreverent expressions which grieved the tender Spirit of the Lord and caused their petitions to be shut out of heaven.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ExV", "page": 58}
