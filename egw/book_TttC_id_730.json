    "word": "The prophet and these fathers did not regard the people of the land as worshipers of the true God, and though these professed friendship and wished to help them, they dared not unite with them in anything relating to His worship. When going up to Jerusalem to build the temple of God and to restore His worship, they would not ask help of the king to assist them in the way, but by fasting and prayer sought the Lord for help. They believed that God would defend and prosper His servants in their efforts to serve Him. The Creator of all things needs not the help of His enemies to establish His worship. He asks not the sacrifice of wickedness, nor accepts the offerings of those who have other gods before the Lord.",
