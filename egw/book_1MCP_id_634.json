{"word": "Textbooks and Thought Patterns. [SEE CHAPTER 13, \"FOOD FOR THE MIND.\"]--With solemn voice the Speaker continued: \"Do you find with these [infidel] authors that which you can recommend as essential to true higher education? Would you dare recommend their study to students who are ignorant of \n\n196 \n\ntheir true character? Wrong habits of thought, when once accepted, become a despotic power that fastens the mind as in a grasp of steel. If many who have received and read these books had never seen them but had accepted the words of the Divine Teacher in their place, they would be far in advance of where they now are in a knowledge of the divine truths of the Word of God, which make men wise unto salvation. These books have led thousands where Satan led Adam and Eve--to a knowledge that God forbade them to have. Through their teachings, students have turned from the Word of the Lord to fables.\"--RH, Mar 12, 1908.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 195}
