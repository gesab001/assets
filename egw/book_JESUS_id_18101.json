{"word": "Here is where thousands are failing. They do not really believe that Jesus pardons them individually. They fail to take God at His word. He has assured us that He is faithful that hath promised to forgive us and be just to His own law. His mercy is not wanting in anything. Were there one defective link in the chain, then we are hopelessly ruined in our sins. . . . There is not one flaw in it, not one missing link. Oh, precious redemption! Why do we not bring this great truth more fully into our lives? How broad it is, that God for Christ's sake forgives us--me, even me--the moment we ask Him to, in living faith, believing that He is fully able to do this.--Letter 85, July 24, 1886, to Uriah Smith, editor of the Review and Herald.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 219}
