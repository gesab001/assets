{"word": "Chap. 54 - Christ the Sum and Substance\n\n     Glory of the Incarnate God--If Jesus were made the sum and substance of every discourse, sinners would be convicted. By the message borne they would know what they must do to be saved. Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary, higher and still higher. Who can declare the glory of the incarnate God? What language can describe it? It is not the men learned in this world's wisdom who have true eloquence.--Ms 176, 1899.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 311}
