    "word": "Those who pursue such a course show that they cannot be trusted. After the evil has been done, they may confess their error; but can they undo the influence they have exerted? Will the \"well done\" be spoken to those who have been false to their trust? These unfaithful workmen have not built upon the eternal Rock, and their foundation will prove to be sliding sand. When the Lord requires us to be distinct and peculiar, how can we crave popularity or seek to imitate the customs and practices of the world? \"Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\" James 4:4.",
