WE CALL THE PARTICULAR \n        ATTENTION OF THE READER TO THE DECLARATION ON PAGE \n        442. IT IS THERE STATED THAT ELDER HULL NEEDED TO BE \n        LED AS A BLIND MAN WHO DEPENDS ON ANOTHER FOR SIGHT. \n        AT THE GENERAL CONFERENCE IN BATTLE CREEK, MAY, 1863, \n        ELDER HULL ACKNOWLEDGED THE JUSTNESS OF THE STATEMENT, \n        BUT HAS SINCE PROTESTED AGAINST IT. THE COMMITTEE NOW \n        MAINTAIN THAT HIS COURSE IN THE SHORT SPACE OF THE \n        PAST FOUR MONTHS, IN ABANDONING EVERY POINT OF RELIGIOUS \n        FAITH DEAR TO US AS A PEOPLE, IS A MOST PALPABLE \n        DEMONSTRATION OF THE CORRECTNESS OF THE ABOVE STATEMENT \n        THAT HE SHOULD FOLLOW THE COUNSEL OF HIS BRETHREN. \n                                                GEN. CONF. COM.] \n\n\n     November 5, 1862, I was shown the condition of Brother Hull. He was in an alarming state. His lack of consecration and vital piety left him subject to Satan's suggestions. He has relied upon his own strength instead of the strong arm of the Lord, and that mighty arm has been partially removed.",
