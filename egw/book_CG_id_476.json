{"word": "By Failure to Require Obedience.--If ungrateful children are fed and clothed and allowed to go uncorrected, they are emboldened to continue in their course \n                                                                           180\nof evil. And inasmuch as their parents or guardians thus favor them and do not require obedience, they are partakers with them in their wicked deeds. Such children might just as well be with the wicked, whose iniquitous course they choose to follow, as to remain in Christian homes, to poison others. In this age of wickedness every Christian must stand firm in condemnation of the evil, Satanic actions of wayward children. Evil youth should not be treated as kind and obedient, but as disturbers of the peace and corrupters of their companions.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 179}
