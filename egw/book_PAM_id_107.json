{"word": "Leadership necessitates gaining the confidence of those for whom you labor.--In order for a man to become a successful minister, something more than book knowledge is essential. The laborer for souls needs integrity, intelligence, industry, energy, and tact. All these are highly essential for the success of a minister of Christ.

Unless the laborer in God's cause can gain the confidence of those for whom he is laboring, he can do but little good.--3T 553.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 53}
