{"word": "Controlling the Imagination.--Had you trained your mind to dwell upon elevated subjects, meditating upon \n\n\n                                                    593 \n\nheavenly themes, you could have done much good. You could have had an influence upon the minds of others to turn their selfish thoughts and world-loving dispositions into the channel of spirituality. Were your affections and thoughts brought into subjection to the will of Christ, you would be capable of doing good. Your imagination is diseased because you have permitted it to run in a forbidden channel, to become dreamy. Daydreaming and romantic castle-building have unfitted you for usefulness. You have lived in an imaginary world; you have been an imaginary martyr and an imaginary Christian. --2T 251 (1869).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 592}
