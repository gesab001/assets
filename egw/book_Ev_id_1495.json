{"word": "The Lord desires that the truth shall come close to the people, and this can be accomplished only by personal labor. Much is comprehended in the command, \"Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that My house may be filled.\" There is a work to be done in this line that has not yet been done. Let God's workers teach the truth in families, drawing close to those for whom they labor. If they thus co-operate with God, He will clothe them with spiritual power. Christ will guide them in their work, entering the houses of the people with them, and giving them words to speak that will sink deep into the hearts of the listeners. The Holy Spirit will open hearts and minds to receive the rays coming from the source of all light.--Review and Herald, Dec. 29, 1904.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 436}
