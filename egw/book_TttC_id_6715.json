    "word": "When these things are dwelt upon as they should be, scoffers will be developed who walk after their own lusts, saying, \"Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\" But \"when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them.\" \"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.\" Thank God, all will not be rocked to sleep in the cradle of carnal security. There will be faithful ones who will discern the signs of the times. While a large number professing present truth will deny their faith by their works, there will be some who will endure unto the end.",
