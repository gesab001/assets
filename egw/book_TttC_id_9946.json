    "word": "Bear in mind that the work of restoring is to be our burden. This work is not to be done in a proud, officious, masterly way. Do not say, by your manner, \"I have the power, and I will use it,\" and pour out accusations upon the erring one. Do your restoring \"in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\" The work set before us to do for our brethren is not to cast them aside, not to press them into discouragement or despair by saying: \"You have disappointed me, and I will not try to help you.\" He who sets himself up as full of wisdom and strength, and bears down upon one who is oppressed and distressed and longing for help, manifests the spirit of the Pharisee, and wraps himself about with the robe of his own self-constituted dignity. In his spirit \n                                                                           399\nhe thanks God that he is not as other men are, and supposes that his course is praiseworthy and that he is too strong to be tempted. But \"if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.\" Verse 3. He himself is in constant danger. He who ignores the grave necessities of his brother will in the providence of God be brought over the same ground that his brother has traveled in trial and sorrow, and by a bitter experience it will be proved to him that he is as helpless and needy as was the suffering one whom he repulsed. \"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\" Verse 7.",
