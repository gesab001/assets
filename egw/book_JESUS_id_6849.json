{"word": "Section Seven - Shadow Over the Nest\n\nShadow Over the Nest \n\n\n     The heart yearns for human love, but this love is not strong enough, or pure enough, or precious enough to supply the place of the love of Jesus. Only in her Saviour can the wife find wisdom, strength, and grace to meet the cares, responsibilities, and sorrows of life. She should make Him her strength and her guide. Let woman give herself to Christ before giving herself to any earthly friend, and enter into no relation which shall conflict with this.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LYL", "page": 79}
