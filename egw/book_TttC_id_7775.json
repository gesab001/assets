    "word": "Chap. 44 - The Support of City Missions\n\n     Dear Brother M: A few days ago I received a letter written by you to Elder N, in which you raise very serious objections to leaving the ----- mission to be supported by your conference, and say that other conferences all over the field should have an equal interest in this mission. But if these conferences do not now have important missions to sustain in cities in their own borders, are there not places where such missions should be established? If your conference is asked to take the ----- mission under its care and carry it on under the supervision of the General Conference, the responsible men should feel that this is an evidence that their brethren have confidence in them, and they should say: \"Yes; we accept the sacred trust. We will do all in our power to make the mission a success and to show that the confidence of our brethren is not misplaced.
