In the sincerity of his heart John related the circumstance to his Master. Jesus said, \"Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. For he that is not against us is on our part\" (verses 39, 40).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SL", "page": 56}
