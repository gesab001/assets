{"word": "Jesus began His ministry at a wedding to show His desire to minister to human happiness.--Jesus did not begin His ministry by some great work before the Sanhedrin at Jerusalem. At a household gathering in a little Galilean village, His power was put forth to add to the joy of a wedding feast. Thus He showed His sympathy with men, and His desire to minister to their happiness. In the wilderness of temptation He Himself had drunk the cup of woe. He came forth to give to men the cup of blessing, by His benediction to hallow the relations of human life.--DA 144.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 201}
