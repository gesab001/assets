    "word": "Chapter 12 \n\n     4-6, 12 (Ephesians 4:4-13). Each Member to Work in His Appointed Place.--[1 Corinthians 12:4-6, 12 quoted.] The vine has many branches, but though all the branches are different, they do not quarrel. In diversity there is unity. All the branches obtain their nourishment from one source. This is an illustration of the unity that is to exist among Christ's followers. In their different lines of work they all have but one Head. The same Spirit, in different ways, works through them. There is harmonious action, though the gifts differ. Study this chapter. You will see from it that the man who is truly united with Christ will never act as though he were a complete whole in himself. . . .",
