    "word": "The Lord has not called young men to work among the churches. They are not called to speak to an audience that does not need their immature labors, that is well aware of the fact, and feels, under their ministration, no drawing of the Spirit. Let young men of ability connect with experienced laborers in the great harvest field. Very many will succeed best by beginning with the canvassing work and improving the opportunities afforded them for gospel ministry.",
