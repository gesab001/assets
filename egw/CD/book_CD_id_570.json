{"word": "Avoid an Impoverished Diet \n\n                                       (1870) 2T 366,367 \n     317. But what about an impoverished diet? I have spoken of the importance of the quantity and quality of food \n                                                                           199\nbeing in strict accordance with the laws of health. But we would not recommend an impoverished diet. I have been shown that many take a wrong view of the health reform, and adopt too poor a diet. They subsist upon a cheap, poor quality of food, prepared without care or reference to the nourishment of the system. It is important that the food should be prepared with care, that the appetite, when not perverted, can relish it. Because we from principle discard the use of meat, butter, mince pies, spices, lard, and that which irritates the stomach and destroys health, the idea should never be given that it is of but little consequence what we eat.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 198}
