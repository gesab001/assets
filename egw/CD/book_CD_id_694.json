{"word": "A child of about ten years was afflicted with chills and fever, and was disinclined to eat. The mother urged her: \"Eat a little of this sponge cake. Here is some nice chicken. Won't you have a taste of these preserves?\" The child finally ate a large meal for a well person. The food urged upon her was not proper for the stomach in health, and should in no case be taken while sick. The mother, in about two hours, was bathing the head of the child, saying she could not understand why she should have such a burning fever. She had added fuel to the fire, and wondered that the fire burned. Had that child been left to let nature take her course, and the stomach take the rest so necessary for it, her sufferings might have been far less. These mothers were not prepared to bring up children. The greatest cause of human suffering is ignorance on the subject of how to treat our own bodies.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 241}
