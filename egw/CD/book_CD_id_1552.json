{"word": "HERE IS OUR WEAKNESS UPON THIS SUBJECT. OUR PUBLICATIONS, WHICH GO OUT TO THE UNTAUGHT AND THOSE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO PREJUDICES, ARE IN ADVANCE, UPON SOME OF THESE POINTS, OF THE PRACTICES OF THOSE AMONG US WHO REPRESENT THE HEALTH REFORM. MRS. WHITE PLEADS TO HAVE THIS MATTER SO REVERSED THAT OUR PUBLICATIONS SHALL SPEAK OUT ONLY THOSE SENTIMENTS UPON WHICH THOSE STANDING AT THE HEAD OF THE REFORM ARE AGREED, AND THEN IN A STYLE NOT TO PREJUDICE, AND PUT GOOD MEN AND GOOD WOMEN BEYOND OUR INFLUENCE. LET THE UNITED PRACTICES OF HEALTH REFORMERS TAKE THE ADVANCE, AND THEN LET OUR PUBLICATIONS FOLLOW, AND SPEAK OUT WELL-MATURED SENTIMENTS AS THE UNTAUGHT CAN BEAR THEM.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 497}
