{"word": "Zwieback \n\n     Zwieback, or twice-baked bread, is one of the most easily digested and most palatable of foods. Let ordinary raised bread be cut in slices and dried in a warm oven till the last trace of moisture disappears. Then let it be browned slightly all the way through. In a dry place this bread can be kept much longer than ordinary bread, and if reheated before using, it will be as fresh as when new. \n     [ZWIEBACK GOOD FOR THE EVENING MEAL--273] \n     [ZWIEBACK IN DIET OF E.
