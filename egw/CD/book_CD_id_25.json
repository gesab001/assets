{"word": "[C.T.B.H. 52, 53] (1890) C.H. 121\n     18. God requires the body to be rendered a living sacrifice to Him, not a dead or a dying sacrifice. The offerings of the ancient Hebrews were to be without blemish, and will it be pleasing to God to accept a human offering that is filled with disease and corruption? He tells us that our body is the temple of the Holy Ghost; and He requires us to take care of this temple, that it may be a fit habitation for His Spirit. The apostle Paul gives us this admonition: \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price; therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.\" All should be very careful to preserve the body in the best condition of health, that they may render to God perfect service, and do their duty in the family and in society.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 21}
