{"word": "I would advise all to take something warm into the stomach, every morning at least. You can do this without much labor. You can make graham gruel. If the graham flour is too coarse, sift it, and while the gruel is hot, add milk. This will make a most palatable and healthful dish for the campground. And if your bread is dry, crumb it into the gruel, and it will be enjoyed. I do not approve of eating much cold food, for the reason that the vitality must be drawn from the system to warm the food until it becomes of the same temperature as the stomach before the work of digestion can be carried on. Another very simple yet wholesome dish, is beans boiled or baked. Dilute a portion of them with water, add milk or cream, and make a broth; the bread can be used as in graham gruel. \n     [SELLING CANDIES, ICE CREAM, ETC., ON CAMPGROUND--529, 530] \n     [NEEDLESS COOKING IN PREPARING FOR CAMP MEETING--57]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 86}
