{"word": "God had important work for the promised child of Manoah to do, and it was to secure for him the qualifications necessary for this work, that the habits of both the mother and the child were to be so carefully regulated. \"Neither let her drink wine nor strong drink,\" was the angel's instruction for the wife of Manoah, \"nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.\" The child will be affected for good or evil by the habits of the mother. She must herself be controlled by principle, and must practice temperance and self-denial, if she would seek the welfare of her child.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 218}
