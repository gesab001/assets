{"word": "No Prescription for Flesh Food \n\n                                                MS 64, 1901 \n     433. Instruction has been given me that physicians who use flesh meat and prescribe it for their patients, should not be employed in our institutions, because they fail decidedly in educating the patients to discard that which makes them sick. The physician who uses and prescribes meat does not reason from cause to effect, and instead of acting as a restorer, he leads the patient by his own example to indulge perverted appetite. \n                                                                           291", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 290}
