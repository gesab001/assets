{"word": "The Stupefied Transgressor Not Guiltless \n\n                                       (1890) C.T.B.H. 79, 80 \n     744. Satan sees that he cannot have so great power over minds when the appetite is kept under control as when it is indulged, and he is constantly working to lead men to indulgence. Under the influence of unhealthful food, the conscience becomes stupefied, the mind is darkened, and its susceptibility to impressions is impaired. But the guilt of the transgressor is not lessened because the conscience has been violated till it has become insensible.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 426}
