Must the vegetables be animalized, must they be incorporated into the system of animals, before we get them? Must we obtain our vegetable diet by eating the flesh of dead creatures? God provided fruit in its natural state for our first parents. He gave to Adam charge of the garden, to dress it, and to care for it, saying, \"To you it shall be for meat.\" One animal was not to destroy another animal for food.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 396}
