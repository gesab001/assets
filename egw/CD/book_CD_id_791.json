{"word": "Nut Ingredients to Be Used Sparingly \n\n                                            Letter 188, 1901 \n     410. The Lord would have people in all parts of the world become intelligent in regard to using the productions of the soil in every locality. The products of each locality are to be studied and carefully investigated, to see if they cannot be combined in such a way as to simplify the production of foods and lessen the cost of manufacture and transportation. Let all do their best under the Lord's supervision to accomplish this. There are many expensive articles of food that the genius of man can combine; and yet there is no real need of using the most expensive preparations.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 273}
