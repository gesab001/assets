You have been untrue to yourself. . . . You appeared like a person without a backbone. You were half reclining upon others, which is a wrong position for a lady to occupy in the presence of others. If you had only thought so, you could have walked as well and sat as erect as many others.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 398}
