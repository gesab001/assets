{"word": "Chap. 61 - Men and Women of the Bible\n\n                  Enoch \n\n     Conversation on Heavenly Things--Enoch's case is before us. Hundreds of years he walked with God. He lived in a corrupt age, when moral pollution was teeming all around him; yet he trained his mind to devotion, to love purity. His conversation was upon heavenly things. He educated his mind to run in this channel, and he bore the impress of the divine. His countenance was lighted up with the light which shineth in the face of Jesus.--2T 122.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 351}
