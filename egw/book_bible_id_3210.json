{"word": "Not to Take the Place of the Word.--The Lord desires you to study your Bibles. He has not given any additional light to take the place of His Word. This light is to bring confused minds to His Word, which, if eaten and digested, is as the lifeblood of the soul. Then good works will be seen as light shining in darkness.-- Letter 130, 1901.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 29}
