{"word": "As the tree of knowledge was placed in the midst of the Garden of Eden, so the Sabbath command is placed in the midst of the Decalogue. In regard to the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the restriction was made, \"Ye shall not eat of it, . . . lest ye die.\" Genesis 3:3. Of the Sabbath God said, Ye shall not defile it, but keep it holy. \"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" Exodus 20:8. As the tree of knowledge was the test of Adam's obedience, so the fourth command is the test that God has given to prove the loyalty of all His people.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 343}
