{"word": "In the days of Christ the educators of the youth were formalists. During his ministry, Jesus declared to the rabbis, \"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.\" And he charged them with \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\" Tradition was dwelt upon, amplified, and reverenced far above the Scriptures. The sayings of men, and an endless round of ceremonies, occupied so large a share of the student's life, that the education which imparts a knowledge of God was neglected. The great teachers were continually enlarging upon little things, specifying every detail to be observed in the ceremonies of religion, and making its observance a matter of highest obligation. They paid \"tithe of mint and anise and cummin,\" while they \"omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith.\" Thus there was brought in a mass of rubbish that hid from the view of the youth the great essentials of the service of God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 160}
