    "word": "\"Satan has ability to suggest doubts and to devise objections to the pointed testimony that God sends, and many think it a virtue, a mark of intelligence in them, to be unbelieving and to question and quibble. Those who desire to doubt will have plenty of room. God does not propose to remove all occasion for unbelief. He gives evidence, which must be carefully investigated with a humble mind and a teachable spirit, and all should decide from the weight of evidence.\" [VOL. 3, P. 255 (1873).] \"God gives sufficient evidence for the candid mind to believe; but he who turns from the weight of evidence because there are a few things which he cannot make plain to his finite understanding \n                                                                           676\nwill be left in the cold, chilling atmosphere of unbelief and questioning doubts, and will make shipwreck of faith.\" [VOL. 4, PP. 232, 233 (1876).]",
