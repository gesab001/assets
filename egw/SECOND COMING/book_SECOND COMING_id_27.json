{"word": "We are to be diligent workers; an idle man is a miserable creature. But what excuse can be offered for idleness in the great work which Christ gave His life to accomplish? The spiritual faculties cease to exist if they are not exercised, and it is Satan's design that they shall perish. All heaven is actively engaged in the work of preparing a people for the second coming of Christ to our world, and \"we are laborers together with God.\" The end of all things is at hand. Now is our opportunity to work.--Review and Herald, Jan. 24, 1893.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 84}
