{"word": "GOOD NEWS.\\97The gospel message proclaimed by Christ\\92s disciples was the announcement of His first advent to the world. It bore to men the good tidings of salvation through faith in Him. It pointed forward to His second coming in glory to redeem His people, and it set before men the hope, through faith and obedience, of sharing the inheritance of the saints in light. This message is given to men today, and at this time there is coupled with it the announcement of Christ\\92s second coming as at hand. The signs which He Himself gave of His coming have been fulfilled, and by the teaching of God\\92s Word we may know that the Lord is at the door.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 21}
