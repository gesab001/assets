{"word": "In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, such a work as that of John is to be done. God calls for men who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of the Lord. The message preceding the public ministry of Christ was, Repent, publicans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees; \"repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" As a people who believe in Christ's soon coming, we have a message to bear,--\"Prepare to meet thy God.\" [Amos 4:12.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW", "page": 55}
