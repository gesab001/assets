{"word": "IN THIS EPISTLE THE APOSTLE INTRODUCES THE SUBJECT OF THE SECOND COMING OF THE LORD. HE THEN DESCRIBES THE STATE OF THE UNBELIEVING WORLD AT THAT TIME, WHO ARE SAYING, \"PEACE AND SAFETY,\" WHEN THE DAY OF THE LORD IS ABOUT TO BURST UPON THEM, AND SUDDEN DESTRUCTION COME UPON THEM AS A THIEF IN THE NIGHT. HE THEN EXHORTS THE CHURCH, IN VIEW OF THESE THINGS, TO KEEP AWAKE, TO WATCH AND BE SOBER. AMONG THE EXHORTATIONS THAT FOLLOW ARE THE WORDS WE HAVE QUOTED, \"QUENCH NOT THE SPIRIT,\" ETC. SOME MAY THINK THAT THESE THREE VERSES ARE COMPLETELY DETACHED FROM ONE ANOTHER IN SENSE; BUT THEY HAVE A NATURAL CONNECTION IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY STAND. THE PERSON WHO QUENCHES THE SPIRIT WILL BE LEFT TO DESPISE PROPHESYINGS, WHICH ARE THE LEGITIMATE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT. \"I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH; AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL \n                                                                           142\nPROPHESY.\" JOEL 2:28. THE EXPRESSION, \"PROVE ALL THINGS,\" IS LIMITED TO THE SUBJECT OF DISCOURSE, PROPHESYINGS, AND WE ARE TO TRY THE SPIRITS BY THE TESTS WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN US IN HIS WORD. SPIRITUAL DECEPTIONS AND FALSE PROPHESYINGS ABOUND AT THE PRESENT TIME; AND DOUBTLESS THIS TEXT HAS A SPECIAL APPLICATION HERE. BUT MARK, THE APOSTLE DOES NOT SAY, REJECT ALL THINGS; BUT, PROVE ALL THINGS; HOLD FAST THAT WHICH IS GOOD.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 141}
