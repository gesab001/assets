{"word": "5, 6. The Elijah Message.--In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, God calls for men who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of the Lord. Just such a work as that which John did, is to be carried on in these last days. The Lord is giving messages to His people, through the instruments He has chosen, and He would have all heed the admonitions and warnings He sends. The message preceding the public ministry of Christ was, Repent, publicans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees; \"for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" Our message is not to be one of peace and safety. As a people who believe in Christ's soon appearing, we have a definite message to bear,--\"Prepare to meet thy God.\"", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "4BC", "page": 1184}
