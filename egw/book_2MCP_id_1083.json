{"word": "Two Elements of Character.--Strength of character consists of two things--power of will and power of self-control. Many youth mistake strong, uncontrolled passion for strength of character, but the truth is that he who is mastered by his passions is a weak man. The real greatness and nobility of the man is measured by the power of the feelings that he subdues, not by the power of the feelings that subdue him. The strongest man is he who, while sensitive to abuse, will yet restrain passion and forgive his enemies. Such men are true heroes.--4T 656 (1881).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 689}
