{"word": "My ministering brethren, do not think that the only work you can do, the only way you can labor for souls, is to give discourses. The best work you can do is to teach, to educate. Whenever you can find an opportunity to do so, sit down with some family, and let them ask questions. Then answer them patiently, humbly. Continue this work in connection with your more public efforts. Preach less, and educate more by holding Bible readings, and by praying with families and little companies.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 340}
