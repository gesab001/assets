    "word": "In our schools missionary nurses should receive  lessons from well-qualified physicians, and as a past of their education should learn how to battle with disease and to show the value of nature's remedies.

They should at the same time maintain an elevated standard in the training of the mind and the culture of the heart, that the Great Physician may co-operate with the human helping hand in doing a work of mercy and necessity in the relief of suffering.",
