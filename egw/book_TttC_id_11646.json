    "word": "Extract from a letter written in 1898 from Cooranbong, New South Wales.--My brother, the Lord God of Israel must be your counselor. Satan has come down with great power to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness. Lean hard on Christ. You have worked untiringly to bring about good results. Do not now make mistakes. Never, never seek to remove one landmark that the Lord has given His people. The truth stands firmly established on the eternal Rock--a foundation that storm and tempest can never move.",
