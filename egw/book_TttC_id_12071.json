    "word": "The Word of God our Safeguard \n\n     Our watchword is to be: \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\" Isaiah 8:20. We have a Bible full of the most precious truth. It contains the alpha and omega of knowledge. The Scriptures, given by inspiration of God, are \"profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.\" 2 Timothy 3:16, 17. Take the Bible as your study book. All can understand its instruction.",
