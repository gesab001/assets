    "word": "Paul writes to his Corinthian brethren: \"Ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are yet not carnal, and walk as men?\" It is impossible for minds distracted by envy and strife to comprehend the deep spiritual truths of God's word. \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\" We cannot rightly understand or appreciate divine revelation without the aid of that Spirit by whom the word was given.",
