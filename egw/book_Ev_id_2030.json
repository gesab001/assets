{"word": "Reaching Parents Through Children.--Our camp meetings are one of the most important agencies in our work. At every camp meeting work should be done for the children. Let suitable workers be constantly educating the children. Ask the blessing of the Lord on the seed sown, and the conviction of the Spirit of God will take hold of even the little ones. Through the children many parents will be reached. --Manuscript 52, 1900.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 584}
