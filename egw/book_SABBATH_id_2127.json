{"word": "Chapter XVI. - Return to Connecticut.\n\n     Thursday p. m. we were to take the boat for Middletown. It was our last opportunity to get to our appointment, unless we should travel upon the Sabbath. We had a season of prayer before leaving. All present did not realize that the boat would not wait for us, and the season of prayer was made too long for the occasion, and we had but a few moments to get to the boat. I took my husband's arm, and we ran about a mile to reach the boat. Brethren Gurney and Bates were on the boat, waiting for us. The captain was about to withdraw the plank, when Bro. Bates interceded, telling him that he had friends that were detained, and he must wait a few moments. He was prevailed upon to wait five minutes. He then declared he would not wait another minute. Just then we appeared in sight. Bro. Bates cried out, \"They are coming! They must go on the boat tonight! You must wait!\" We sprung upon the plank as it was being withdrawn, the boat started, and we were on our way to Conn.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 104}
