{"word": "He who prefers the society of the ignorant and vicious to that of the wise and good shows that his own character is defective. His tastes and habits may at first be altogether dissimilar to the tastes and habits of those whose company he seeks, but as he mingles with this class his thoughts and feelings change; he sacrifices right  principles and insensibly yet unavoidably sinks to the level of his companions. As a stream always partakes of the property of the soil through which it runs, so the  principles and habits of youth invariably become tinctured with the character of the company in which they mingle. --CT 221 (1913).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 610}
