{"word": "Circulate Without Discrimination \n\n     There are many places in which the voice of the minister cannot be heard, places which can be reached only by publications,--the books, papers, and tracts that are filled with the Bible truth that the people need. Our literature is to be distributed everywhere. The truth is to be sown beside all waters; for we know not which shall prosper, this or that. In our erring judgment we may think it unwise to give literature to the very ones who would accept the truth most readily. We know not what may be the good results of giving away a leaflet containing present truth.--Southern Watchman, Jan. 5, 1904.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 153}
