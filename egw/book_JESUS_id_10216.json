{"word": "Christ left all to save men from the consequence and penalty of the transgression of the law. The way from the manger to Calvary was marked with blood. The Son of God did not deviate from the path of unwavering obedience, even to the death of the cross. He endured all the woe of man's sin. . . . I beseech you, in the name of Christ, that you confess your sins and reform your ways, that your name may not be blotted out of the book of life, but may be confessed before the Father and before His angels. Jesus is pleading His blood before the Father; and now, while mercy lingers and probation is prolonged, seek the approbation of Heaven.--Review and Herald, June 29, 1911.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 57}
