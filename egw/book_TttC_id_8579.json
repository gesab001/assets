    "word": "\"The volumes of Spirit of Prophecy, [THE GREAT CONTROVERSY] and also the Testimonies, should be introduced into every Sabbathkeeping family, and the brethren should know their value and be urged to read them. It was not the wisest plan to place these books at a low figure and have only one set in a church. They should be in the library of every family and be read again and again. Let them be kept where they can be read by many.\" [VOL. 4, P.  390 (1880).]",
