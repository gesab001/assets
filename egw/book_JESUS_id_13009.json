{"word": "Seeing the tears and hearing the groans of Jesus, those who stood about said, \"Behold, how he loved him!\" Then they whispered among themselves, \"Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?\" Jesus groaned within himself at the unbelief of those who had professed faith in him. They thought his tears were because of his love for Lazarus, and that he who had done such mighty works had been unable to save Lazarus from death. Burdened by the blind infidelity of those who should have had faith in him, Jesus approached the grave, and in tones of authority commanded that the stone should be rolled away. Human hands were, on their part, required to do all that it was possible \n                                                                           365\nfor them to do, and then divine power would finish the work.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 364}
