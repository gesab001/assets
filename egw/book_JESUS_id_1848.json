Shall those who are \"looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works,\" be behind the religionists of the day who have no faith in the soon appearing of our Saviour?
