{"word": "Characters as Varied as the Flowers.--From the endless variety of plants and flowers, we may learn an important lesson. All blossoms are not the same in form or color. Some possess healing virtues. Some are always fragrant. There are  professing Christians who think it their duty to make every other Christian like themselves. This is man's plan, not the plan of God. In the church of God there is room for characters as varied as are the flowers in a garden. In His spiritual garden there are many varieties of flowers.--Lt 95, 1902. (Ev 99.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 54}
