    "word": "4 (chs. 10:18; 17:3). Christ's Life Was Unborrowed.--\"In Him was life; and the life was the light of men.\" It is not physical life that is here specified, but eternal life, the life which is exclusively the property of God. The Word, who was with God, and who was God, had this life. Physical life is something which each individual received. It is not eternal or immortal; for God, the Lifegiver, takes it again. Man has no control over his life. But the life of Christ was unborrowed. No one can take this life from Him. \"I lay it down of myself,\" He said. In Him was life, original, unborrowed, underived. This life is not inherent in man. He can possess it only through Christ. He cannot earn it; it is given him as a free gift if he will believe in Christ as his personal Saviour. \"This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" John 17:3. This is the open fountain of life for the world (ST Feb. 13, 1912).",
