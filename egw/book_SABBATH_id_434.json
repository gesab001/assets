{"word": "Need of Consecration in Sabbath School Workers \n\n\n     Those who engage in Sabbath school work should be persons who have consecrated themselves to God. They should be men and women of strong faith and warm sympathies, who are fervent of spirit, and interested in all that pertains to the cause of Christ. They should give themselves to the work with unselfish  endeavor, and at whatever sacrifice it may require, laying themselves on the altar, and pleading, with strong crying and tears, for the conversion of the youth who have been committed to their charge. Among those who would work for the Lord in the Sabbath school, let all selfish ambition be crucified, and \"let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.\" Let it be the Sabbath school worker's first ambition to educate the youth to do their duty in the fear of God and with simplicity.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 155}
