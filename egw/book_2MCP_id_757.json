{"word": "Superstition Arising Out of Imagination.--Your experience was shown to me as not reliable because opposed to natural law. It is in conflict with the unchangeable principles of nature. Superstition, my dear sister, arising from a diseased imagination, arrays you in conflict with science and principle. Which shall be yielded? Your strong prejudices and very set ideas in regard to what course is best to be pursued relative to yourself have long held you from good. I have understood your case for years but have felt incompetent to present the matter in so clear a manner that you could see and comprehend it and put to a practical use the light given you.--3T 69 (1872).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 594}
