    "word": "The advancement of the church is retarded by the wrong course of its members. Uniting with the church, although an important and necessary act, does not make one a Christian nor ensure salvation. We cannot secure a title to heaven by having our names enrolled upon the church book while our hearts are alienated from Christ. We should be His faithful representatives on earth, working in unison with Him. \"Beloved, now are we the sons of God.\" We should keep in mind this holy relationship and do nothing to bring dishonor upon our Father's cause.",
