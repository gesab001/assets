{"word": "Let not the aged workers think that they must carry all the responsibilities, all the loads.  New fields of labor are constantly opening before us.  Let the young men unite with experienced laborers who understand the Scriptures, who have long been doers of the Word, who have brought the truth into the practical life, relying upon Christ day by day, who seek the Lord as Daniel did.

The truth as it is in Jesus--the sword of the Spirit, which cuts both ways--was his weapon of warfare.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "RY", "page": 47}
