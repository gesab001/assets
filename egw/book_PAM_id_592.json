God had shown me those who keep God's commandments are to have nothing to do [in anointing and special prayer] for the sick of those who are daily trampling them underfoot, unless it is in some special case where souls are convicted of the truth and are decided to move out upon it. The partition wall between commandment keepers and those who trample them underfoot should be kept.--Lt 4, 1857 (Quoted in 1BIO 404.)", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 233}
