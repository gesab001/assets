{"word": "The Bible teacher should be one who is able to teach the students how to present the truths of the word of God in a clear, winning manner in public and how to do effective evangelistic work from house to house. It is essential that he be skillful in teaching those who have a desire to work for the Master how to use wisely that which they have learned. He should instruct the students to approach the study of the Bible in the spirit of humility, to search its pages, not for proof to sustain human opinions, but with a sincere desire to know what God has said.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 431}
