    "word": "Sources: Letter 295, 1905; 2MR pp. 70-71\n     My brethren and sisters in the South, will you not act your part in the good work of helping the Huntsville School? Have you not some time to spare in its behalf, that you can devote to the sale of Christ\u2019s Object Lessons? By taking up this work you will be acting as missionaries for the Lord Jesus. His approval will rest upon you as you try to assist the faithful workers in the Huntsville School. By circulating Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, not only will you be helping the Huntsville School but you will be placing in the hands of men and women a book containing the most precious spiritual instruction.",
