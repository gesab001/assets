    "word": "Christ is our High Priest. Satan stands before Him night and day as an accuser of the brethren. With masterly power he presents their objectionable features of character as sufficient reason for the withdrawal of Christ's protecting power, thus allowing Satan to discourage and destroy those whom he has caused to sin. But Christ has made atonement for every sinner. We may by faith hear our Advocate saying, \"The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the burning?\"",
