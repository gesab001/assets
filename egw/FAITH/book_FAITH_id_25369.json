    "word": "All this passed through my mind like a flash of lightning and I was sensible how little trust or dependence could be put in the friendship of men when human thoughts and human passions bear sway. Just as sure as the enemy is permitted to bear sway then we may expect anything. Human friendship, bonds, and ties of relationship are severed, and why? Because there is a difference of opinion in interpretation of the Scriptures. It is the same spirit which condemned the Lord of life and glory. The truth that sanctifies the soul produces no briers and thorns. \"By their fruits ye shall know them\" (Matthew 7:20). Then the words were spoken, \"Only lay hold of the strength of the Mighty One. He is a Friend that will never leave thee, never betray thee. He is thy refuge. No storm or tempest can move thee. In God is thy strength. Faith in God is thy shield and buckler. His grace is sufficient for thee.\"",
