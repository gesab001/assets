The Lord authorizes us to pray, declaring that He will hear the prayers of those who trust in His infinite power. He will be honored by those who draw nigh to Him, who faithfully do His service. \"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.\" Isaiah 26:3.
