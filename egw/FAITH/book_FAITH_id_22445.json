Under this training, students will come forth from our schools educated for practical life, able to put their intellectual capabilities to the best use. Physical and mental exercise must be combined if we do justice to our students. We have been working on this plan here with complete satisfaction, notwithstanding the inconveniences under which students have to labor.--Letter 47a, 1895, pp. 1, 4. (To Dr. and Mrs. J. H.
