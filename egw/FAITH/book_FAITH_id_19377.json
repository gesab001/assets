    "word": "Only God's Plans to be Followed. \n\n     You are not to limit the Holy One of Israel, whose power is of old, and whose ways are past finding out. If you mark out ways whereby you expect God to work, you will be disappointed. The kingdom of heaven cometh not with observation. You are to leave God to work in his own way, and you must walk, not by sight, but by faith. God has a work to be done, and it is a very solemn, sacred work. It is not wise to follow plans of your own devising. Some who now bear the message of truth, will let the banner fall from their hands, and trail in the dust, and will then trample it under their feet. Some who are now in the darkness of error will receive the truth, and be converted, and will lift aloft the banner from the hands of those who now hold it. Your only hope is in firm reliance upon God. Watch unto prayer; move forward in hope, expressing gratitude, revealing the victory of faith in your \n\n\n                       - 19 - \n\nown soul, and others will be influenced to follow the leadings of God.",
