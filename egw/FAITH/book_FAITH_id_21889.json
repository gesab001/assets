    "word": "We must not think that by walking in the path of obedience, we shall escape trials; for the enemy will do all in his power to hinder us from gaining heaven. But the Saviour has promised to help us. Have you trials? So had Jesus. Are you tempted? So was He--in all points like as we are. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him,. and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received him not. \"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\"  \"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.\"",
