    "word": "In all you do, make Christ the center of attraction. Constantly look to Him who is your pattern, the Author and Finisher of your faith. Cultivate constant, fervent gratitude to God for the gift of His beloved Son. Represent Christ. Squander not your moral forces upon trifles, but earnestly improve the opportunities given you to reflect the light of the Sun of Righteousness. Cease to glorify man. Glory in Christ and the truth. You may crown Jesus with honor, for though so meek and lowly He was a daily conqueror over temptation. Every soul who is a partaker of the divine nature is an overcomer in His own behalf, and is victorious, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.",
