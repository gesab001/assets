    "word": "A thorough and complete trust in Jesus will give the right quality to religious experience. Aside from this the experience is nothing. The service is like the offering of Cain--Christless. God is glorified by living faith in a personal, all-sufficient Saviour. Faith views Christ as He is--the sinner's only hope. Faith takes hold of Christ, trusts Him. It says, \"He loves me; He died for me. I accept the sacrifice, and Christ shall not have died for me in vain.\" \n                                                                           376",
