    "word": "After the passing of the time [1844], God entrusted to His faithful followers the precious principles of present truth. . . . Those who passed through these experiences are to be as firm as a rock to the principles that have made us Seventh-day Adventists. . . . Those who took part in the establishment of our work upon a foundation of Bible truth, those who know the way marks that have pointed out the right path, are to be regarded as workers of the highest value. They can speak from personal experience regarding the truths entrusted to them. These workers are not to permit their faith to be changed to infidelity; they are not to permit the banner of the third angel to be taken from their hands. They are to hold the beginning of their confidence firm unto the end.",
