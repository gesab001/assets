I am glad this matter has come to a head, and I am sure the time has come for a change in the atmosphere in Nashville. I am pleased that the exhibition of prejudice did not extinguish the exercise of mercy. The Lord is for us, and will be for us as long as we are for him. I think I will make an effort to raise some money. I will see what can be done. I found a long article in one of my diaries written some time ago in reference to the matters at Nashville,-- the location of the sanitarium. I am desirous that the work shall advance. I think we need not be discouraged in regard to the sanitarium in Nashville. Keep up good heart; have faith in God.",
