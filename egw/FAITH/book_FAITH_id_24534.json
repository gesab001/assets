    "word": "We have too little faith, too feeble a trust in God, too little conformity to the divine will. We have a great work to do, and if we are laborers together with God, the ministering angels will cooperate with us in the work. We can only reach the people through God. Then let us lay hold of this His mighty power by living faith, praying and believing, trusting and working. Then God will do that \n\n\n                                     -302- \n\nwhich only God can do. God and his workers are to be closely united.",
