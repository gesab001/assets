    "word": "\"Parents stand in the place of God to their children, and they will have to render an account whether they have been faithful to the little few committed to their care. Parents, some of you are rearing children to be cut down by the destroying angel unless you speedily change your course, and are faithful to them. He can not love unruly children who manifest passion, and he can not save them in the time of trouble. Will you suffer your children to be lost through your neglect? Unfaithful parents, their blood will be upon you, and is not your salvation doubtful with the blood of your children upon you?--children who might have been saved had you filled your place, and done your duty as faithful parents should. . . . . .",
