    "word": "Let ministers and teachers remember that God holds them accountable to fill their office to the best of their ability, to bring into their work their very best powers. They are not to take up duties that conflict with the work God has given them. When ministers and teachers, pressed continually under the burden of financial responsibility, enter the pulpit or the schoolroom weary and tired, with throbbing brain and overtaxed nerves, what can be expected but that common fire will be used instead of the sacred fire of God's kindling? The strained, tattered efforts hurt the speaker and disappoint the listeners. He has had no time to seek the Lord, no time to ask in faith for the unction of the Holy Spirit. Shall we not change this way of working?--Manuscript 101, 1902.",
