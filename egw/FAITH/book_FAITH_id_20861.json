    "word": "My brother, I wrote this while at the April meetings in Healdsburg and Oakland, and then so many and severe burdens came upon me I could not venture to gather more upon my soul. I am sorry, very sorry, that I did not give it to you then and there, without further delay. I again caution you in reference to your children. Do not indulge them. How does it agree with our profession of faith and your teaching to \n\n\n                         [39] \n\nothers to do as you are doing? Zua has qualities that with proper education and training, would make her a useful woman. But her parents' false ideas of life and their vanity in regard to their children are in danger of spoiling her. You now have light on this point, and should work together in harmony. Will you heed this light? I encouraged Sister Daniels to go with her  husband in his work, for I thought, yes, I knew, that another influence must be brought to bear upon the children if they were to be saved for the future immortal life. When you take your children with you, and encourage them in self-indulgence, and give to others an example of lax government, then I know your influence will not be as God would have it, and you would all do better to remain at home. You are not able to get your daughter a saddle pony and necessary equipments, neither are you able to get Paul a pony. You should encourage your oldest son to work with his hands. You should encourage your daughter to take up domestic duties. As a poor man's daughter, she should be useful and bear her own weight. Work will not be unhandy or disagreeable to her unless your own instructions, and the society you place her in, shall give her an education that will mar her prospects for both worlds.                                   E.G. White. \n\n                                               -",
