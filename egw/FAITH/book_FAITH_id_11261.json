    "word": "Vivid Memories of the Past \n\n     We arrived on the campground at Syracuse, New York, August 20.  The next day, Thursday, we were glad to greet Elder U. Smith and wife.  Here we met Elder Wheeler, with whom we became acquainted in New Hampshire thirty years ago.  Here was Elder Cottrell, whom we have known for thirty years; Elder Taylor, for more than twenty-five years; Brother Robinson, for thirty-five years.  My heart was touched as I looked upon these brethren who had long stood in defense of the faith.",
