    "word": "Hope of the Church\n[FROM THE REVIEW OF JUNE 10, 1852.]\n\n\n     As I have of late looked around to find the humble followers of the meek and lowly Jesus, my mind has been much exercised. Many who profess to be looking for the speedy coming of Christ are becoming conformed to this world and seek more earnestly the applause of those around them than the approbation of God. They are cold and formal, like the nominal churches from which they but a short time since separated. The words addressed to the Laodicean church describe their present condition perfectly. (See Revelation 3:14-20.) They are \"neither cold nor hot,\" but \n                                                                           108\n\"lukewarm\". And unless they heed the counsel of the \"faithful and true Witness,\" and zealously repent and obtain \"gold tried in the fire,\" \"white raiment,\" and \"eye-salve,\" He will spew them out of His mouth.",
