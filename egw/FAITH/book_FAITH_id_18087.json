    "word": "Human beings are Satan\u2019s captives and are naturally inclined to follow his suggestions and do his bidding. They have in themselves no power to oppose effectual resistance to evil. It is only as Christ abides in them by living faith, influencing their desires and strengthening them with strength from above, that they may venture to face so terrible a foe. Every other means of defense is utterly vain. It is only through Christ that Satan\u2019s power is limited. This is a momentous truth that all should understand. Satan is busy every moment, going to and fro, walking up and down in the earth, seeking whom he may devour. But the earnest prayer of faith will baffle his strongest efforts. Then take \u201cthe shield of faith,\u201d brethren and sisters, \u201cwherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.\u201d\u2014Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 293, 294.",
