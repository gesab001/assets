    "word": "God expects every man to do his duty. \"Ye are my witnesses,\" saith the Lord. Call men to repentance. Set before them in clear, distinct lines, their danger; point them to him who taketh away the sin of the world. Carry the offer of Christ's mercy and righteousness to those who are lost. Many will resent your testimony; you can expect nothing else, for they resented the testimony of the Son of God. But if we stand in God, faithful and true, our testimony will be as a hammer breaking in places the rocky hearts, a fire consuming the refuge of lies.",
