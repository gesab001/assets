    "word": "The Lord wants brother Nelson to clothe himself with the garments of righteousness, and to bring into his practical life the sweetness and fragrance of the character of Christ. This brother possesses qualifications of mind and character that if sanctified daily for the Master's use would enable him to become a vessel unto honor. But he needs the moulding and fashioning of Jesus. \"The love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things: and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.\"",
