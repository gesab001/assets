    "word": "\u201cBlessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly. . . . But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\u201d [Psalm 1:1-3.] It is only as the law of God is restored to its rightful position that there can be a revival of primitive faith and godliness among his professed people. \u201cThus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.\u201d [Jeremiah 6:16.]",
