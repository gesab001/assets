    "word": "Often the Lord sees that His workers are in doubt as to what they should do. At such times, if they will put their confidence in Him, He will reveal to them His will. God's work is now to advance rapidly, and if His people will respond to His call, He will make the possessors of property willing to donate of their means, and thus make it possible for His work to be accomplished in the earth. \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" Faith in the word of God will place His people in the possession of property which will enable them to work the large cities that are waiting for the message of truth.",
