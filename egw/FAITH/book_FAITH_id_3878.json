    "word": "Between the worldly man and the one who is faithfully serving God, there is a great gulf fixed. Upon the most momentous subjects,--God and truth and eternity,--their thoughts and sympathies and feelings are not in harmony. One class is ripening as wheat for the garner of God, the other as tares for the fires of destruction. How can there be unity of purpose or action between them? \"Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\" \"No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\"--Should Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? pp. 3-10. (1892)",
