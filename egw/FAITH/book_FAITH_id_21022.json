    "word": "Bro. Gage's influence, if unsanctified, endangers the souls of those who follow his example. His ready tact and ingenuity is admired, and leads those in connection with him to give him credit for qualifications that he does not possess. At the Office he was reckless of his time. If this affected only himself it would have been a small matter; but his position as foreman gave him influence. His example before those in the Office, and especially the apprentices, was not circumspect and conscientious. If Bro. Gage had, with his ingenious talent, a sense of high moral obligation, his services would be invaluable to the Office. If his principles had been such that no motive could have moved him from the straight line of duty, no inducement which could have been presented to him would have purchased his consent to a wrong action, his influence would have molded others; but his desires for pleasure allured him from his post of duty. If he had stood in the strength of God, unmoved by censure or flattery, his soul steady to principle, faithful to his convictions of truth and justice, he would have been a superior \n                                                                           29\nman, and would have won a commanding influence everywhere. Bro. Gage lacks frugality and economy. He lacks tact which would enable him to adapt himself to the opening providence of God to make him a minute man. He loved human praise. He was swayed by circumstances, subject to temptation, and his integrity could not be relied upon.",
