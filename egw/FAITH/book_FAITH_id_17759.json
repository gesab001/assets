    "word": "We are to beware of those who are denying their past experience, and who, through specious devising, would if possible deceive the very elect. He who is our Advocate in the heavenly courts is acquainted with every particular of the deceptive wiles of those who are doing this work. Those who are departing from the faith are at work to undermine the confidence of others, and they have been thus at work for years. Our warnings come from the One who is interested in us, because He sees our dangers, and is acquainted with the conniving of those who are opposed to His truth. . . .",
