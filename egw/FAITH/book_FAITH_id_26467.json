    "word": "(MS-3-'08.) \"Southern Calif. is a field that should depend more than it has upon its own resources. It should have more facilities, and should not be cramped as it has been in some respects. Southern Calif. is a missionary field, a large part of which has received but little missionary effort. Henceforth it should receive more attention. The various lines of work that can be carried on should be diligently studied, and the advantages of such cities as Redlands and Riverside and the need of putting forth decided effort for them, faithfully investigated. . . It was the Lord who placed in our possession the sanitarium at Loma Linda. . . . In Loma Linda we have an advantageous center for carrying on various missionary enterprises. We can see that it was in the providence of God that this sanitarium was placed in the possession of our people. (781) We should appreciate Loma Linda as a place which the Lord foresaw we should need, and which He gave.\"",
