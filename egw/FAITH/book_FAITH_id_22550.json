    "word": "But present in fervent words how punishment for finite man has rested upon the Innocent, even the divine Son of God, in order that man might have a mighty Advocate to plead in the sinner's behalf. Was this done that man might continue in sin and be saved in sin? Oh, no! Sin is the hideous thing for which there was no remedy. Christ took the penalty that man might, through faith in Him, have life. The sinner's heart will melt; the soul will be conquered.--Manuscript 55, 1890, pp. 1-7.
