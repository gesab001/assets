    "word": "But Nathanael was prejudiced against the Nazarenes: through the influence of false teaching, unbelief arose in his heart, and he asked, \"Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?\" Philip did not try to combat his prejudice and unbelief. He said, \"Come and see.\" Philip was wise, for as soon as Nathanael saw Jesus, he was convinced that Philip was right. His unbelief was swept away, and faith, firm, strong, and abiding, took possession of his soul. Jesus commended the trusting faith of Nathanael.",
