    "word": "Shall the faithful servant of God keep silent when there is under his notice those who make it evident by the way they perform their daily duties, that unless their evil habits are changed, he will work at a great disadvantage? There are some young men and women who have no method of doing their work. Though they are always busy, they can present but little results. They have erroneous ideas of work, and think they are working hard, when if they had practiced method in their work, and applied themselves much more in a shorter time. By dallying over the less important matters, they find themselves hurried, perplexed, and confused when they are called upon to do those duties that are more essential. They are always doing, and they think, working very hard; and yet there is little to show for their efforts. Under circumstances like these, where young men and women are making such mistakes in their life discipline, it would be sinful not to speak words of advice and counsel. \n\n\n                                 -78-",
