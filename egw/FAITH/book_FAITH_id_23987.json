    "word": "I have been thinking about the Mt. Vernon institute, and I have little faith in it. I dislike to have Dr. Gibbs mixed up with it, lest it go down entirely and he bear the censure of its failure. He is not a financier, and when placed in any of our institutions he should have a managing financier. I wish you had before you all that I have written about the Mt. Vernon institution; then you would better understand the light that has been, in clear lines, presented before Elder Underwood and Brother Irwin, and you would better understand the decided position I felt compelled to take in the council meetings in the Review office. If the conference or the sanitarium decide to shoulder the institution, I am clear in the matter.",
