    "word": "There is a work to be done in all our cities, and those who still work and walk humbly with God, striving daily to be overcomers, will gain precious victories day by day. The work that is done in humility will bear the divine credentials. Let us hide in God. That which I see most clearly is the necessity of men and women's being united in doing the work that needs to be done in our cities. . . . The Lord bears long with men, and He calls earnestly for everyone to repent. Will the ministers, will the physicians, take up this work that has scarcely been touched? May God help us to be faithful and to do the very work that is now most essential. \n                                                                           545",
