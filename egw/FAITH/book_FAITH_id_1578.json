    "word": "The Lord imparts a fitness for the work to every man and woman who will co-operate with divine power. All the requisite talent, courage, perseverance, faith, and tact will come as they put the armor on. A great work is to be done in our world, and human agencies will surely respond to the demand. The world must hear the warning. When the call comes, \"Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?\" send back the answer clear and distinct, \"Here am I; send me.\"--Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 331-333. (1900)",
