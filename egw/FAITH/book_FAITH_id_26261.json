    "word": "In those early days, how many seasons of fervent prayer were held! A holy, submissive, Christlike spirit was breathed upon us; for we knew that the Saviour was with us. No one was instructed to spend years in preparation for the work to be done. Practical, earnest knowledge was imparted. There was seen the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Few today are better armed and equipped for service than were the workers of that time. Christianity was seen to be the exemplification of the Holy Spirit's working on human hearts. God's wonderful, miracle-working power was exercised according to our faith. The manifest revealing of the grace of Christ carried a deeper conviction to souls than the logic of man could possibly have carried. \n\n\n                        -55-",
