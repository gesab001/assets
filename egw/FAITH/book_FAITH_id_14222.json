    "word": "When these children decide to leave the pleasures of the world themselves, and choose to be Christ's disciples, what a burden is lifted from the hearts of careful, faithful parents. Yet even then the labor of the parents must not cease. The children then should not be left to take their own course, and always choose for themselves. They have then just commenced the warfare in earnest against sin, pride, passion, envy, jealousy, hatred, and all the evils of the natural heart. And parents need to watch and counsel their children, and decide for them, and show them that if they do not yield cheerful, willing obedience to their parents, they cannot yield willing obedience to God, and it is impossible for them to be Christians.",
