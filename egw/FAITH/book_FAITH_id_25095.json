    "word": "Of those who do their part faithfully, it is said, \"Ye are laborers together with God\" [1 Corinthians 3:9]. Apart from divine aid, man can do very little; but the heavenly Father and His Son are ready to work through everyone who consecrates himself wholly on the altar of service. Every soul before me may cooperate with God, and labor for Him acceptably. The Lord desires us all to come into line. To every man He has given an appointed work, according to their several ability.",
