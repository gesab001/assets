    "word": "The Lord \"doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.\" \"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.\" He knows our heart, for he reads every secret of the soul. He knows whether or not those for whom petitions are offered would be able to endure the trial and test that would come upon them if they lived. He knows the end from the beginning. Many will be laid away to sleep in Jesus before the fiery ordeal of the time of trouble shall come upon our world. This is another reason why we should say after our earnest petition: \"Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.\" Such a petition will never be registered in heaven as a faithless prayer.",
