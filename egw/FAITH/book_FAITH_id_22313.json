    "word": "Elder [E.E.] Franke's gifts will be needed in the campmeetings, where he can do a work that God has chosen him to do. God designs that New York shall be stirred. He has a message for this wicked city. We know not what He will do to arouse it. But he will provide means. He knows what is best. Human judgment often makes mistakes, but the Lord Jesus never makes a mistake. I have faith that the loud cry is to be heard in Greater New York.",
