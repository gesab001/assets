    "word": "We are not surprised to find that Satan will work today as he has worked in the past. We must live by faith; for without faith it is impossible to please God. . . . Boasting claims of righteousness and noisy demonstrations are calculated to lead to a fanatical experience that will confuse many minds. If such things are encouraged, a wave of fanaticism will come into our ranks that will be detrimental to the work of God, and that will sweep away many souls in a dangerous delusion. These things are designed by Satan to deceive, if possible, the very elect.",
