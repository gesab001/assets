    "word": "Let us exercise faith in God, and keep close to the side of Christ in following His Word. The Lord will teach His people if they will be taught.

Whole legions of devils are watching their opportunities to get hold of human minds, but if we keep close to the Word, we shall not be overcome. \"Wherefore,\" said Paul to Timothy, \"I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of hands. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\"",
