    "word": "Dear Mary, how pleasant it will be to see the King in His matchless loveliness and be where there is no pain, no sorrow, no sickness, no sadness. I feel so clear that we shall be victorious, and I feel clear that the communication is opened between God and your soul. It seems so sure to me that you have the divine Presence and that Jesus is your constant helper. Oh, He loves you; He loves you, and is looking upon you with pitying tenderness. Never doubt Him for a moment. Commit your case to Him, having faith that He will do for you the very thing that is best for your eternal interest. . . .",
