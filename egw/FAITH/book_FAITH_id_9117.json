    "word": "In the time of trial before us God\u2019s pledge of security will be placed upon those who have kept the word of His patience. Christ will say to His faithful ones: \u201cCome, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpast\u201d (Isaiah 26:20). The Lion of Judah, so terrible to the rejectors of His grace, will be the Lamb of God to the obedient and faithful. The pillar of cloud which speaks wrath and terror to the transgressor of God\u2019s law is light and mercy and deliverance to those who have kept His commandments. The arm strong to smite the rebellious will be strong to deliver the loyal. Every faithful one will surely be gathered. \u201cHe shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other\u201d (Matthew 24:31).",
