    "word": "In our camp meetings call to the front men of long experience and of the very best talent -- men who can impress hearts by bringing forth clearly the strong reasons of our faith; men who obey the words, \"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\"",
