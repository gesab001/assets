    "word": "To know the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ is everything to us individually. We must wear the yoke of Christ. Only in submission and consecration is rest found. God in Christ is full of mercy, love, goodness, and truth. His compassion cannot be measured. Look at the cross of Calvary. Behold God's precious gift. We should set a high estimate upon the Gospel, building our hopes on the sure Rock, Christ Jesus. The time has come, and this will be seen more and more plainly, when a faithful standard bearer for God, who ministers in word and doctrine, is far more secure than those who possess gold and silver.--Ms 87, 1898, p. 1.
