    "word": "God was to be manifest in Christ, \"reconciling the world unto himself.\" Man had become so degraded by sin that it was impossible for him, in himself, to come into harmony with Him whose nature is purity and goodness.

Thus by repentance toward God and faith in Christ, the fallen children of Adam might once more become \"sons of God.\"",
