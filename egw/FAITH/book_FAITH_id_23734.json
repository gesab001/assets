    "word": "While probationary time lasts, men should work the works of God, \"for the night cometh, when no man can work.\" God requires of every one vigilant work, combined with faithful waiting and watching. Working alone will not do. Bustle and continual activity are not enough to satisfy the requirements of God. We must \"rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him.\" We must not move hurriedly. We must work and watch and pray and wait.",
