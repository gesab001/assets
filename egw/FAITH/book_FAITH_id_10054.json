    "word": "Character and future destiny\n     \u201cThe righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ,\u201d this is our dependence. Through the merits of Jesus, you can be made clean and white in character, if you consecrate yourselves to Him, with a determined purpose that right here in this school you will live a Christian life. You are now forming characters that will determine your future destiny, for life or for death. If there are those here that have never taken hold of Christ by living faith, I entreat of you to do this at the earliest possible moment; for you will suffer great loss if you neglect this.",
