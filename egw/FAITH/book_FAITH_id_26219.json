    "word": "To Every Man His Work \n\n     We are laborers together with God. We must have spiritual workers, not only laborers who labor in the pulpit for the churches but those who will do personal work among the people. Too much time is devoted to the churches in preaching. This is not attended with the best results. The work of the Lord's ambassadors is to organize a company of workers to hunt for souls who need help, but hours are spent in preaching that had better be devoted to personal house to house labor. In the Spirit of Christ, with the heart all aglow with his love, seek to win the hearts of those in the family. Give faithful admonitions and \n                                                                           154\ninstructions from the Word of God. There are appropriate and applicable Scriptures that need to be presented, and to be presented in love for souls for whom Christ has died. \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" But many souls have had no personal labor. Words of kindly instruction in the application of Scriptures have not been spoken to them.",
