    "word": "Prayer Makes a Hedge About Children.--In the morning the Christian's first thoughts should be upon God. Worldly labor and self-interest should be secondary. Children should be taught to respect and reverence the hour of prayer. . . . It is the duty of Christian parents, morning and evening, by earnest prayer and persevering faith, to make a hedge about their children. They should patiently instruct them--kindly and untiringly teach them how to live in order to  please God. \n                                                                           520",
