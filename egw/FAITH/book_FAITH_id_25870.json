    "word": "Brethren Prescott, Jones, and Waggoner are fallible. You are fully as fallible. They may err in some points. You also may err in some points. Do not let any bitterness enter your soul; for it will do more harm than you suppose. The end is near, the Lord is soon to come, and you need to have your life insured. This will be the very best life insurance policy that was ever instituted. \"Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. . . . Wherefore, the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\"",
