    "word": "MR No. 1571 - Our Need of Christ's Transforming Grace, Humility, and Love\n\n     (Written February 8, 1886, from Basel, Switzerland, to Brother and Sister Harmon.) \n\n\n     I was very glad to receive letters from you, but I am unable to answer them at present. For two weeks I have suffered with congestion of the brain and eyes. Last Thursday I had a two-hours' chill and was very sick all day. Friday morning our people arrived from America. Sabbath I had another chill, lighter, but was unable to sit up through the day. Have been quite sick today. How this will terminate I cannot tell, except that I do have faith in God that I will have strength to accomplish the great amount of work that is now in my hands in writing and arranging books. I am astonished at the amount of labor that God has given me strength to do since I have been here in Europe.",
