    "word": "God's Plan All Sufficient. \n\n     He has given his people a plan for raising sums sufficient to make the enterprise self sustaining. God's plan in the tithing system is beautiful in its simplicity and equality. All may take hold of it in faith and courage, for it is of divine origin. In it are combined simplicity and utility, and it does not require depth of learning to understand and execute it.",
