    "word": "I am instructed by the Lord to say that position never gives a man grace or makes him righteous. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" Some men entrusted with positions of responsibility entertain the idea that position is for the aggrandizement of self. Let no manager think that all minds must be subjected to his mind, that all wills must be subordinate to his will, and that all methods must be laid aside for his methods. Greater injury cannot be done to any institution than by allowing such a man to remain in his position, after proper test and trial. It is a sin against God to permit unfaithful stewards to remain in positions of trust; for the Lord's people are liable to be misled by their unfaithfulness.--MS. 154, 1902. \n                                                                           166",
