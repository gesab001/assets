    "word": "Some zealous ones who are aiming and straining every energy for originality have made a grave mistake in trying to get something startling, wonderful, entrancing, before the people, something that they think others do not comprehend; but often they do not themselves know what they are talking about. They speculate upon God's word, advancing ideas that are not a whit of help to themselves or to the churches. For the time being they may excite the imagination; but there is a reaction, and these very ideas become a hindrance. Faith is confounded with fancy, and their views may bias the mind in the wrong direction. Let the plain, simple statements of the word of God be food for the mind; this speculating upon ideas that are not clearly presented there is dangerous business.",
