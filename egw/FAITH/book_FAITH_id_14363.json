    "word": "The thieves who were crucified with Jesus suffered like physical torture with Him: but one was only hardened and rendered desperate and defiant by his pain. He took up the mocking of the priest, and railed upon Jesus, saying, \"If Thou be Christ, save Thyself\n223\nand us.\" Luke 23:39. The other malefactor was not a hardened criminal. When he heard the sneering words of his companion in crime, he \"rebuked him, saying, Dost thou not fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man hath done nothing amiss.\" Luke 23:40, 41. Then, as his heart went out to Christ, heavenly illumination flooded his mind. In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging upon the cross, he saw his Redeemer, his only hope, and appealed to him in humble faith: \"Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee today, [BY PLACING THE COMMA AFTER THE WORD TODAY, INSTEAD OF AFTER THE WORD THEE, AS IN THE COMMON VERSIONS, THE TRUE MEANING OF THE TEXT IS MORE APPARENT.] shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.\" Luke 23:43.",
