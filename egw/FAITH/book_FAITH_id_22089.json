    "word": "I have felt greatly perplexed to know just what to do in the case of your father. He seems to have mind enough, but is forever studying his own feelings, which eclipses faith. He gets habits and notions, such as wetting his head and hands and feet. All these are innocent, but carried to excess are doing him great injury. . . . The restlessness, wanting to be riding continually, is very difficult to manage. . . . These habits keep his mind centered upon himself. . . . I feel so sorry for poor Father.--Letter 18, 1878, pp. 1, 2. (To W. C. White, March 20, 1878.)",
