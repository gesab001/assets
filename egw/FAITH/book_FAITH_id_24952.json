    "word": "If we are to do as the apostle recommends us to do--give to every man a reason of the hope that is within us with meekness and fear--then we want the truth stamped upon our hearts. Here is where the great lack has been with many, very many. They have a nominal faith. There has been too much time devoted to small things unworthy of the least thought, and the mind is dwarfed and bound about with the things it dwelt upon. Shall we have the converting power of God in our midst? Christ says, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and \n\n\n                -24- \n\nknock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.\" Clear away the rubbish you have piled before the door of your heart and let Jesus come in.",
