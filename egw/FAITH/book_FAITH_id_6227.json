    "word": "What we need now is untiring energy and perseverance, so that we will not be broken off from the work by difficulties and home perplexities. If we do allow our interest to be thus separated, the enemy will understand it, and he will make trouble right in our families to draw us away from the work. But if we firmly take our stand as God's workmen, saying, \u201cThe Lord has given us a message, and we cannot be faithful watchmen unless we stand at our post of duty; we will carry the work through at all hazards,\u201d then we shall find that angels of God will minister to our households at home, and will say to the enemy, \u201cStand back.\u201d It is a great and solemn work in which we are engaged, and God will help us to carry it forward, if we learn to rely wholly upon him.",
