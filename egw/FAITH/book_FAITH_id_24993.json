    "word": "When things become entangled, and cannot easily be adjusted, we are not to lose heart and courage and faith, and talk doubts and unbelief. Discouragement will spread and become as a deadly malady. Again and again during the last forty years of our experience we have been brought into strait places, but the Lord's own power, not human philosophy or wisdom, set things straight. The Lord made His voice to be heard, guarding against rebellion, the seeds of which are sown in hearts that are not right with God. It is the Lord that has saved us from rebellion and apostasy. We cannot fall as long as we hope and trust in God.",
