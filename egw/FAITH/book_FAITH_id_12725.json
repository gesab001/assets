    "word": "Christ himself, the foundation and the crowning glory of God's temple, became \"a rock of offense to them that stumble at the word.\" Yet that chief foundation stone, \"disallowed indeed of men,\" was \"chosen of God and precious.\" Though rejected by the Jewish builders, it became the head of the corner.
