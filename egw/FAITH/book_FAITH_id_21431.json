    "word": "As health reformers, it is a part of our work to make known to the world the principles of health reform. The question of diet means much to everyone. I am charged to instruct our workers to demonstrate the value of the health reform principles, for such a demonstration will give them wider influence. In our churches instruction should be given in the principles of healthful living. We need a faith that is a working efficiency.--Letter 172, 1909, p. 3. (To Elder and Mrs. J. E. White, Dec. 22, 1909.)",
