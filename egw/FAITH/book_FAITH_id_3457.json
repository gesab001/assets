    "word": "CHARLES FITCH, A PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER, ACCEPTED THE ADVENT MESSAGE FROM READING WILLIAM MILLER'S LECTURES AND THROUGH HIS MEETING WITH JOSIAH LITCH. HE THREW HIMSELF WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE PROCLAMATION OF THE EXPECTED ADVENT OF CHRIST AT THE CLOSE OF THE 2300-YEAR PERIOD, AND BECAME A PROMINENT LEADER IN THE ADVENT AWAKENING. IN 1842 HE DESIGNED THE PROPHETIC CHART USED SO EFFECTIVELY AND REFERRED TO IN EARLY WRITINGS ON PAGE 74. HE DIED A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK BEFORE OCTOBER 22, 1844. HIS DEATH CAME ABOUT THROUGH ILLNESS CONTRACTED THROUGH OVER-EXPOSURE IN CONDUCTING THREE BAPTISMAL SERVICES ON A CHILLY AUTUMN DAY. (SEE PROPHETIC FAITH OF OUR FATHERS, VOL. 4, PP. 533-545.)",
