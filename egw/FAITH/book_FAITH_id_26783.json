    "word": "Several times, even before they took up the work in Berrien Springs, Brethren Magan and Sutherland expressed to me their burden for the work in the South. Their hearts are there. Do not blame them for going. Do not put any impediments in their way. Let them go, and may God go with them, and may His blessing attend them. They will take with them from this place many pleasant memories of seasons of peace and joy. There have been times of sorrow, but they do not go because of this. They think that they can better glorify God by going to a new field. This is their own choice; I have not persuaded them. They did not know but what Sister White would stand in their way. But when they laid the matter before me this morning, I told them that I would not hinder them for one moment. Any one who takes up work in the South has before him a hard battle. The work there should be far in advance of what it is now. We should encourage the men who go there, and hold them up by our faith and by our prayers.",
