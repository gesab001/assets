    "word": "The Lord would have had New York with all its surrounding localities and cities worked many years ago, and now, that the opportunity is more plainly revealed, in all localities, in every church, hearts should be drawn out and connected with the progress of the gospel message. In all the neglected parts of the vineyard hearts should be thrilled with a genuine, living experience; and now that there is a great work started, no one must fold his hands, but all must regard with interest every movement of the church. The churches now in different parts of Greater New York are to feel their sacred, \n\n\n                     (9) \n\nGod-given responsibilities. The word of the Lord is for this wide missionary field to be faithfully worked, and every vestige of criticism, and fault-finding and separating of brethren to cease. The prejudices, their thinking and speaking evil are to be put away. God will not tolerate any longer the spirit that has been controlling matters in our New York churches. The fields here are ready for harvest. In whatever direction we look our brethren must do their appointed work, which stretches to a large, unmeasured circumference. Those who would cherish and foster prejudice are not to be listened to. The work is to go forward under the direction of God, and those who wish to keep up the spirit of dissension should take themselves out of the way, and let God's work move onward.",
