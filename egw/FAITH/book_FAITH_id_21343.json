    "word": "The training and discipline you undergo in order to be successful in your games is not fitting you to become faithful soldiers of Jesus Christ, to fight His battles and gain spiritual victories. The money expended for garments to make a pleasing show in these match games is so much money that might have been used to advance the cause of God in new places, bringing the word of truth to souls in darkness of error. O that God would give all the true sense of what it means to be a Christian! It is to be Christlike. He lived not to please Himself. Letter 47, 1893, p. 7. (To Professor W. W. Prescott, October 25, 1893.)",
