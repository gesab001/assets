    "word": "GOD DOES NOT ALWAYS ANSWER AS WE EXPECT, BUT ALWAYS FOR OUR GOOD.\u2014Ask, then; ask, and ye shall receive. Ask for humility, wisdom, courage, increase of faith. To every sincere prayer an answer will come. It may not come just as you desire, or at the time you look for it; but it will come in the way and at the time that will best meet your need. The prayers you offer in loneliness, in weariness, in trial, God answers, not always according to your expectations, but always for your good.\u2014(Messages to Young People, 250.)",
