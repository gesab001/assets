    "word": "We need missionary ministers, ministers who are missionaries in deed and in truth, who place themselves in communication with the Lord Jesus Christ by living faith and earnest prayer, by complete surrender to God, so that Heaven's message through them may be given to the world. Then \n                                                                           5\nthey will not fail to make decided impressions, inciting those who hear them to repentance, faith, love, joy, and earnest work for the Master. But in order to have life-giving power from the Source of all light and knowledge, the workers must be responsive to every movement of the Holy Spirit, that divine light may shine through them to the church and to the world. Ministers should not allow themselves to take a low level, they should aim high. In order to exercise themselves unto godliness, in order to rightly take hold of the sacred work in which they are engaged, they need daily to be lifted up by the Holy Spirit, to breathe the pure atmosphere of spiritual holiness.",
