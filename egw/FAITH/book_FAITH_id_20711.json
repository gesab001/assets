    "word": "Danger of Accepting Darkness. \n\n     The Spirit of God is departing from many among his people. Many have entered into dark, secret paths, and some will never return. They will continue to stumble to their ruin. They have tempted God, they have rejected light. All the evidence that will ever be given them they have received, and have not heeded. They have chosen darkness rather than light, and have defiled their souls. No man or church can associate with a pleasure-loving class, and reveal that they appreciate the rich current which the Lord has sent to those who have simple faith in his word. The world is polluted, corrupted, as was the world in the days of Noah. The only remedy is belief in \n\n\n                     -35- \n\nthe truth, acceptance of the light. Yet many have listened to the truth spoken in demonstration of the Spirit, and they have not only refused to accept the message, but they have hated the light. These men are parties to the ruin of souls. They have interposed themselves between the heaven-sent light and the people. They have trampled upon the word of God, and are doing despite to his Holy Spirit.",
