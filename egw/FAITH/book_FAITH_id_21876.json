    "word": "MR No. 313 - Work Among the Jews\n\n     Israel trusted in the ark of God and worshiped it instead of the God which the ark represented. And the Lord removed from His people the symbol of His presence, the assurance to them of the presence and power of God. Then the Jewish nation no longer stood as a chosen generation, a royal priesthood. They had forgotten their God, and were scattered into all parts of the world. Those who were loyal and steadfast and true in obedience to His commandments, the Lord favored. He manifested Himself to them in order to keep up the light of His presence, the beams of the Sun of Righteousness. In the absence of the ceremonial ordinances, the outward display and glory of God was removed from the Jewish nation for such a time as God determined; but the inner glory of representative men was to shine forth. Even in the land of their captivity was the Lord God revealed. For all who were faithful, wherever they were, the way was left open to approach God through prayer and supplication and heavenly communion.--Ms 122, 1897, pp. 7, 8. (\"Daniel,\" March 10, 1897.)",
