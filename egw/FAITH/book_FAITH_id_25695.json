The cross of Christ must occupy the central place, Christ be lifted up as never before, \n                                                                           857\nand the attention of the people be riveted upon the world's Redeemer. We know comparatively little of the glory that attends the truth. O, we have so little faith! Jesus came to be the center of the recovered world. Says Christ, \"I will implant the holy Spirit in every heart that will open to me; I will be a living, abiding power in every element of influence, and engage every holy agency in the universe. All evil influences have confederated to corrupt and destroy. All who believe on me, shall under my banner combine to oppose them; I will conduct the warfare; I will give efficiency to the whole.\"",
