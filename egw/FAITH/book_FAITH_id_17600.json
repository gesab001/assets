    "word": "Christ the sinless One, upon whom the Holy Spirit was bestowed without measure, constantly acknowledged His dependence upon God, and sought fresh supplies from the Source of strength and wisdom. How much more should finite, erring man feel his need of help from God every hour and every moment. How carefully should he follow the leading Hand, how carefully treasure every word that has been given for his guidance and instruction! \"As the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress,\" so should our eyes be upon the Lord our God. His commands should be received with implicit faith, and obeyed with cheerful exactness.",
