White \"Relief Books.\" [THE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALE OF CHRIST'S OBJECT LESSONS (1900) AND THE MINISTRY OF HEALING (1905) WERE DONATED BY ELLEN WHITE FOR THE RELIEF OF INDEBTEDNESS ON OUR EDUCATIONAL AND MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. GREAT SUCCESS ATTENDED THE INITIAL DRIVES TO SELL THESE BOOKS, AND THE SPIRITUAL AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS WERE CONSIDERABLE.]--Many have never learned how to sell the books dedicated to the advancement of our institutional work. But such should not excuse themselves. They should study diligently how they may do their part faithfully in connection with the circulation of these precious books. Our schools and sanitariums must be conducted on a high plane of efficiency, and a solemn responsibility rests upon us all to help place these institutions on vantage ground by giving the relief books a wide circulation. God will be glorified by everyone who takes an active interest in the work of placing these books in the hands of the multitudes who are in need of the saving truths of the gospel.",
