THIS LETTER TO THE EPHESIANS \n                                                                           141\nWAS WRITTEN IN A.D. 64, ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE PAUL TOLD TIMOTHY THAT HE WAS READY TO BE OFFERED, AND THE TIME OF HIS DEPARTURE WAS AT HAND. THE SEEDS OF THE APOSTASY WERE NOW GERMINATING IN THE CHURCH, FOR PAUL HAD SAID TEN YEARS BEFORE, IN HIS SECOND LETTER TO THE THESSALONIANS, \"THE MYSTERY OF INIQUITY DOTH ALREADY WORK.\" GRIEVOUS WOLVES WERE NOW ABOUT TO ENTER IN, NOT SPARING THE FLOCK. THE CHURCH WAS NOT THEN RISING AND ADVANCING TO THAT PERFECTION IN UNITY CONTEMPLATED IN THE TEXT, BUT WAS ABOUT TO BE TORN BY FACTIONS AND DISTRACTED BY DIVISIONS. THE APOSTLE KNEW THIS; CONSEQUENTLY HE MUST HAVE LOOKED BEYOND THE GREAT APOSTASY, TO THE PERIOD OF THE GATHERING OF THE REMNANT OF GOD'S PEOPLE, WHEN HE SAID, \"TILL WE ALL COME INTO [MARGIN] THE UNITY OF THE FAITH.\" EPHESIANS 4:13. HENCE THE GIFTS THAT WERE SET IN THE CHURCH HAVE NOT YET SERVED OUT THEIR TIME.",
