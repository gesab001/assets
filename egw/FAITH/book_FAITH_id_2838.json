    "word": "All who shall unite to praise and honor and glorify those who have lifted the banner of Satan are fighting against God. Our work now is to enlighten the world, in the place of bearing a peace-and-safety message. A banner has been placed in our hands, upon which is inscribed, \"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the  faith of Jesus.\" This is a distinct, separating message,-- a message that is to give no uncertain sound. It is to lead the people away from the broken cisterns \n                                                                           103\nthat contain no water, to the fountain of living waters.--Letter 60, 1898.",
