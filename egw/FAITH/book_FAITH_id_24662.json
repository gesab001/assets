    "word": "Many Will Be Stirred \n     Many young men and women now engaged in secular labor will feel earnestly stirred to give themselves to the service of God, to become channels of light. Some will feel a burden to enter the canvassing field, and will become able evangelists. Let these be given an opportunity to obtain an education for the work of God. And let all God's workers help and cheer and encourage one another with their prayers and faithful conversation, impressing one another with the dignity and responsibility of the work in which they are engaged. All missionary work is sacred. Said Paul, \"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.\" --Letter 66, 1901 \n                                                                           45",
