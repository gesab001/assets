    "word": "When beginning to recover, so that in his feebleness and poverty he commenced to labor some, he asked of those who then stood at the head of matters at the Office forty per cent discount on a one hundred dollar order for books. He was willing to pay sixty dollars for the books which he knew cost the Association only fifty dollars. He asked this special discount in view of his past labors and sacrifices in favor of the publishing department. But he was denied this small favor. He was coolly told that they could give him but twenty-five per cent discount. My husband thought this very hard, yet he tried to bear it in a Christian manner. God in Heaven marked the unjust decision, and \n                                                                           103\nfrom that time took the case in his own hands, and has returned the blessings removed, as he did to faithful Job. And from the time of that heartless decision he has been working for his servant. God raised him up above his former health of body, clearness and strength of mind, and freedom of spirit. And he has, since that time, had the pleasure of passing out with his own hands thousands of dollar's worth of our publications without price. God will not utterly forget nor forever forsake those who have been faithful, even if in their course errors sometimes occur.",
