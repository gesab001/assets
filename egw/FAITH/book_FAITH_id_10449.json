    "word": "As a shield from temptation and an inspiration to purity and truth, no other influence can equal the sense of God\u2019s presence. \u201cAll things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\u201d He is \u201cof purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.\u201d Hebrews 4:13; Habakkuk 1:13. This thought was Joseph\u2019s shield amidst the corruptions of Egypt. To the allurements of temptation his answer was steadfast: \u201cHow . . . can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\u201d Genesis 39:9. Such a shield, faith, if cherished, will bring to every soul.",
