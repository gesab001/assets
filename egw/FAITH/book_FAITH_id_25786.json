    "word": "The Lord Jesus is dishonored whenever brethren of the same faith accuse another and lessen the influence of one of God's delegated messengers. The enemies of truth will make the very most of the least item by which they can excite suspicion of the men through whom God is giving light to the people. To place any obstruction in the way of this light coming to the people, will be registered as a grievous sin in the sight of God. Better lose the right arm or the right eye than to be found in this kind of work. \"It must needs be that offenses come; but woe unto that man by whom the offense cometh.\" Let not the influence graciously given you of God to save souls from ruin be employed in weakening the influence of others whom the Lord is using.",
