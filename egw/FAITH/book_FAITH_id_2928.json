    "word": "Arriving at the place of execution, the prisoners were bound to the instruments of torture. . . . The  mother of Jesus, supported by John the beloved disciple, had followed the steps of her Son to Calvary. She had seen Him fainting under the burden of the cross, and had  longed to place a supporting hand beneath His wounded head, and to bathe that brow which had once been pillowed upon her bosom. But she was not permitted this mournful privilege. . . . Her heart would sink as she recalled the words in which He had foretold the very scenes that were then taking place. . . . Must she give up her faith that Jesus was the Messiah?  Must she witness His shame and sorrow, without even the privilege of ministering to Him in His distress?  She saw His hands stretched upon the cross; the hammer and the nails were brought, and as the spikes were driven through the tender flesh, the heart-stricken disciples bore away from the cruel scene the fainting form of the mother of Jesus.--DA 741-744 (1898).",
