    "word": "The Lord God of heaven, who made our world, and who created man, guards the interest of every soul. To every man he has given his work. We are laborers together with God. There are diversities of gifts, and every man should appreciate the moral and spiritual capital which God has entrusted to him. No one should treat these entrusted talents with indifference. No one is accountable for talents he has never had: none should complain of the smallness of their gifts. Every one is to trade on that which God has entrusted to him, working where he can, doing the best possible service for the Master. One talent \n                                                                           1440\nwell used, will gain other talents, and these still others. The man with a few pence can serve God with his pence; if he does this, he is in God's sight judged as faithful as the one who has improved five talents.",
