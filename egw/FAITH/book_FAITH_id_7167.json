    "word": "\"I desire the love of Jesus as I never desired it before. I see reason to praise God for His goodness, His preserving care, and for the sweet peace, joy, and courage He gave me on this journey. I started out by faith, and not by sight; and I have seen the hand of God in every day's labor, and daily His praise has been in my heart and on my lips. His Spirit has helped my infirmities in so marked a manner that I cannot fear to commit myself to His keeping. I have the perfect assurance of His love. He has heard and answered my prayers, and I will praise Him.\" [REVIEW AND HERALD, FEB. 5, 1884.]",
