    "word": "There are thousands that have been addicted to complaining; they are chronic grumblers. But all such will never enter heaven. How can you be cured? Christ tells you: \"A new heart will I give you.\" Do they profess to believe the truth? I shall know it when there is a change in that unruly member, the tongue. \"A new heart will I give thee.\" We shall find in the place of a stirring up by the leaven of disaffection, we shall find there are words that cement; there are words that bind together. They will not see something in everyone around them to find fault with but themselves, and expatiate upon other's evil. But they are beginning to look and say, Am I right? Have I that love, that faith that works by love and purifies the heart for the second, the latter, rain, the descent of the Holy Spirit of God?",
