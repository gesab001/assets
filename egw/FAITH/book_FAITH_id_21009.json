    "word": "In the testimony given me one year ago last January, I was shown that the Health Institute was not in a prosperous condition. In some matters, Bro. G_____ might fill the position of superintendent, while he is deficient in many respects. He has not a retentive memory, nor is he careful and painstaking. He is willing to occupy responsible positions, but is unwilling to bear the necessary burdens of his post with faith and patience. Such responsibilities rest lightly upon \n                                                                           20\nBro. G_____. He has much pride and self-confidence, and makes more effort to please and gain favor, than to bear the real burdens of the work in which he is engaged.",
