    "word": "Day and night I have been sending my prayers up to the Lord. . . . I have been weighed down as I have thought of the situation of those who have had such great light, and yet have gone steadily on step by step in rejection of light. . . . I long to see the unbelief break. I long to see Satan defeated and expelled. . . . I am holding on by the gift of faith.--Letter 84, Feb. 17, 1906, to Elder and Mrs. E. W. Farnsworth, laboring in Battle Creek, Michigan.",
