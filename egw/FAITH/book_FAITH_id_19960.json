    "word": "The Christian soldier will be trained through daily tests to prove his fidelity. If in compliance with the conditions, efforts are constantly made to \"cleanse ourselves \n\n\n                           -7- \n\nfrom all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\" then God will do all he has promised; we shall have our names registered in the Lamb's book of life, and in the investigative judgment, the True Witness says, I will not blot out his name out of the book of life.\" The names of the faithful will stand as sons and daughters of God, members of the royal family, children of the Heavenly King. I have been shown that there exists a lamentable ignorance in regard to the guile that lurks in the human heart, which constantly inclines to self-indulgence, to pride, to self-importance, to love of self-exaltation, to seek the praise of men.",
