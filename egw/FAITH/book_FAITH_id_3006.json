    "word": "I am so glad to know that Jesus our Saviour is soon to come, and that then we may all meet around the great white throne. I mean to be there, and, if we are both true and faithful to the end, I believe that we shall meet your husband. We may have to pass through trying scenes, but we are safe as we hide our lives in Christ in God. Many will give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, and the only hope for every soul is to look constantly unto Jesus, the Author and the Finisher of our faith.",
