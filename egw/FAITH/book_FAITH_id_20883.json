    "word": "It is unfortunate that men so closely connected with the work as Brn. Aldrich and Walker, should possess just the turn of mind they do. They have with them a tendency to spiritual sloth, and a love to engage in worldly commerce. They are not helps to one another in the right way. Their interest is not kept awake by their association together, and strengthened by mutual zeal and devotion to the work. A mist and cloud is gathering over the Office. Things are not as God would have them. There is not a consecration to the work. Self and self-interest are too prominent. There is not that sanctified judgment \n                                                                           12\nexercised that should be in the management of all pertaining to the Office. There is not a nice discrimination with regard to the workers. Some have received too liberal wages, while others who have been just as faithful, have had less, though they have been more needy.",
