    "word": "I have expected that some account of these matters would be sent to me, and that counsel would be asked, and thus the way would be opened for me to let the light from my past experience shine forth.

It is a terrible mistake to accept and present before the people that which we have not had unmistakable evidence is the revelation of God, when so many deceptions are presenting themselves.",
