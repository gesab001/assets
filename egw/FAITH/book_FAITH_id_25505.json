    "word": "My brethren, we must have Jesus enthroned within, and self must die. We must be baptized with the Holy Spirit, and then we shall not sit down, saying unconcernedly, \"What is to be will be. Prophecy must be fulfilled.\" Oh, awake, I pray you, awake! for you bear the most sacred responsibilities. As faithful watchmen you should see the sword coming, and give the warning, that men and women may not pursue a course through ignorance that they would avoid if they knew the truth. The Lord has enlightened us in regard to what is coming upon the earth that we may enlighten others, and we shall not be held guiltless if we are content to sit at ease, with folded hands, and quibble over matters of minor importance. The minds of many have \n                                                                           506\nbeen engrossed with contentions, and they have rejected the light given through the Testimonies because it did not agree with their own opinions. God will not work a miracle to convince these rebellious ones of the truth of the Testimonies, and compel them to acknowledge His message. He has given sufficient evidence for their faith, and it is only the stubbornness of the natural heart that prevents them from acknowledging the light.",
