    "word": "So it may be now. Let Christians put away all dissension and give themselves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them ask in faith for the promised blessing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was \"the former rain,\" and glorious was the result. But the latter rain will be more abundant. What is the promise to those living in these last days? \"Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even today do I declare that I will render double unto thee\" (Zechariah 9:12) \"Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field\" (Zechariah 10:1).--Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 20, 21.",
