The obligation to use your talents in the Master's service rests heavily upon you. Come to the Lord, and make an entire surrender of all to Him. You can not afford to lose one day. Take up your neglected work. Put away your querulous unbelief, your envy and evil-thinking, and go to work, in humble faith and with earnest prayer to the Lord to pardon you for your years of unconsecration. Ask Him for help. If you seek Him earnestly, with the whole heart, you will find Him, and He will strengthen and bless you. \n\n                                               -",
