    "word": "Open the door of your heart, and Christ, the heavenly guest, will come in. . . . You may have a nominal faith, just such a faith as the people had who crowded about Jesus in the streets of Judea, but this faith will not connect you with Him. You need a faith similar to the faith of the poor woman who had been diseased for many years. She had sought help from the physicians, but her disease grew worse and worse. She heard of Christ, and her faith went out to Him. She believed that if she could only touch the hem of His garment she would be made whole. Christ understood the longing of her heart; He understands the desire of every heart that is drawn out after Him, and He responds to it. This poor woman who yearned after help improved her first opportunity to come into the presence of Jesus. The multitude were all about Him, but she pressed through the crowd, until she could touch His garment, and that moment she was healed. Christ realized that virtue had gone out of Him. The woman had felt her desperate \n64\nneed, and her faith had made her whole. So it will be with every one of you who go in your need to Jesus and lay hold upon Him by living faith.",
