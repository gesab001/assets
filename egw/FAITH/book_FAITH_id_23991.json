    "word": "It is the positive duty of all Christians professing to believe the truth, to reveal its principles at all times and in all places. They are enjoined to fight the good fight of faith. Satan is walking about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour; he works with his angels to put every soul off his guard in little things. Those who with becoming fortitude recognize great tests and bereavements and calamities in life as ordered or permitted of God, and rely upon God for grace according to the day, are upset and lose self-control over some petty vexation or some words spoken. And the enemy, walking about, watching his chance and seeking whom he may devour, is full of exultation, for he can work with his satanic cunning to separate very friends. He [who] would repay the deepest injury with kindness, is irritated and loses his self-control by an act of discourtesy or an act of scorn. The man who feels at times sincerely, and would willingly give his life to save a soul from death, will fail to conquer a spirit and habit, and will by wrong words and unwise actions imperil a soul and throw him on Satan's battleground where he cannot be rescued. \n\n\n                                     -94-",
