    "word": "\"IN THE LIFE OF CHRIST THE PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW ARE MADE PLAIN; AND AS THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD TOUCHES THE HEART; AS THE LIGHT OF CHRIST REVEALS TO MEN THEIR NEED OF HIS CLEANSING BLOOD AND HIS JUSTIFYING RIGHTEOUSNESS, THE LAW IS STILL AN AGENT IN BRINGING US TO CHRIST, THAT WE MAY BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH. 'THE LAW OF THE LORD IS PERFECT, CONVERTING THE SOUL.'",
