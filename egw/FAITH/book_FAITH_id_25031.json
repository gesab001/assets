    "word": "I love Jesus, and I want you to love Him. If you depend upon the power that is above every human power, you will gain the victory. Have faith in God. Human expectations may fail, but there is no failure in the promises of God. They are Yea and Amen in Christ. I claim God's promises, and I know that He will respond to my faith. He will do just as He has said He will do. I want you to have the comfort of the grace of God. I want you to feel that you are not alone, that you have a Comforter.",
