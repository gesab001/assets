    "word": "How E. G. White Faced the Future and Christ's Coming--The Lord is soon to come, and I must be prepared to meet Him in peace. I am sure that the world is ripening for the last great conflict. I am determined to do all in my power to impart light to those around me. I am not to be sad, but cheerful, and I am to keep the Lord Jesus ever before me. He is coming soon, and we must be ready and waiting for His appearing. O how glorious it will be to see Him and be saved through His merits. Long we have waited, but our faith is not to become weak. It is to grow stronger as we see the signs of the times fulfilling. The end is near and we are to put all our energies into the work of preparing to move from this lower school to the school above.--Letter 94, 1903, p. 1. (To Lucinda Hall, May 21, 1903.) \n\n\n                                  -280-",
