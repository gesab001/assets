    "word": "Meat in Due Season.--Permit me to express my mind, and yet not my mind , but the word of the Lord. I am troubled in regard to the Signs of the Times. There are plenty of newspapers and magazines that publish many of the things which are put into the Signs.

I think if the editor of this paper could discern the necessity of being a faithful householder, he would give meat in due season to the flock of God.

Let there be fewer pictures, and more real, solid, spiritual food. . . .",
