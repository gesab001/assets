    "word": "Christ can do nothing for those who are yoked up with the enemy. His invitation to us is, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" When in our daily experience we learn His meekness and lowliness, we find rest. There is then no necessity to search for some mysterious science to soothe the sick. We already have the science which gives them real rest--the science of salvation, the science of restoration, the science of a living faith in a living Saviour.--MS. 105, 1901.",
