    "word": "Many look upon a study of books as the principal purpose of their scholastic life. They know very little of practical business management, and are therefore one-sided. Their faculties have not been developed proportionately. They have not plowed deep, to understand the weak points in their character-building, and they do not realize their own deficiency. They start wrong. They feel too unconcerned in regard to becoming involved in debt. They do not look critically at the outcome of this. What is faith? True faith takes in the whole man. It enables the soul to rise out of an imperfect, undeveloped state, and to understand what wisdom is. See Proverbs 8.",
