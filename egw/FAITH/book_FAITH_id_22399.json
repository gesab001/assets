    "word": "I waited no longer, but went trusting in God. I saw most of the brethren and sisters. As I warned them of their dangers, some were rejoiced that God had sent me, others refused to listen to my testimony as soon as they learned that I was not in union with their spirit. They said I was going back to the world, that we must be so straight and plain and so full of glory, as they called their shouting and hallooing, that the world would hate and persecute us. Our brethren had hardly faith enough to let us go. They thought we were presumptuous to place ourselves in the way of an excited and wrathful community. We did not listen to their suggestions, but followed the Lord's bidding.",
