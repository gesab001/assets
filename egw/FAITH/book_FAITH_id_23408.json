    "word": "I know you all are earnestly struggling after the higher life and for clearer views of heavenly things, yet how slow the progress. How difficult for the mind to rise to the full assurance of hope that maketh not ashamed. In spite of all our efforts, we are often discouraged because the flesh warreth against the spirit. Let not the common cheap things engross the mind that the presence of Jesus shall be withdrawn. The life of the church is communicated from Christ, and He to the church, and we help the church when we work in harmony with the life giving power, when we lose sight of ourselves and seek to build one another up in the most holy faith. \n\n\n                                     -149-",
