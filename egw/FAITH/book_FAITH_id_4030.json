    "word": "The Scriptures are to be received as God's word to us, not written merely, but spoken. When the afflicted ones came to Christ, He beheld not only those who asked for help, but all who throughout the ages should come to Him in like need and with like faith. When He said to the paralytic, \"Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee\"; when He said to the woman of Capernaum, \"Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace,\" He spoke to other afflicted, sin-burdened ones who should seek His help.",
