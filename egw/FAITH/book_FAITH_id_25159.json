    "word": "Parents cannot commit a greater sin that to neglect their God-given responsibilities in leaving their children with nothing to do; for these children will soon learn to love idleness, and grow up to be shiftless, useless men and women. When they become old enough to earn their living, and are taken into employment, they will work in a lazy droning way, and will think they will be paid just the same if they idle away their time, as if they did faithful work. There is every difference between this class of workers and those who realize that they must be faithful stewards. In whatsoever line of work they engage, the youth should be \"diligent in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,\" for he that is unfaithful in that which is least, is unfaithful also in much. \n\n\n                             -28-",
