    "word": "Abel, Enoch, and Noah were representative men in that age to the inhabitants of the old world. Everyone had had their test upon the law of God. Would they obey God, would they do just as He told them to do, or would they disobey and realize the results? If Noah had been like many in our day who say, \u201cBelieve, believe; all you have to do is believe,\u201d then he would not have condemned the world. But Noah had that genuine faith, that faith that works. He testified by his faith and works to the inhabitants of the Noachic world that he believed God. Had he stood back and said, \u201cI cannot build this ark; why, I will be considered crazy if I build this ark on dry land,\u201d then he would have had no influence for good upon them. But he believed just what God had said, and carried it out by his works.",
