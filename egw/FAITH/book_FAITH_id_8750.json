    "word": "God has given us talents to use for Him. To one He gives five talents, to another two, and to another one. Let not him who has but one talent think to hide it from God. The Lord knows where it is hidden. He knows that it is doing nothing for Him. When the Lord comes, He will ask His servants, What have you done with the talents I entrusted to you? And as he who received five and he who received two tell Him that by trading they have doubled their talents, He will say to them, \"Well done, good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. . . . Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" Thus He will say also to him who has improved the one talent lent him. . . .",
