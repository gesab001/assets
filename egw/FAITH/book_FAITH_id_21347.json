    "word": "MR No. 97 - Simplicity in Dress \n\n     As I have seen many Sabbathkeeping Adventists becoming worldly in thought, conversation, and dress, my heart has been saddened. The people who claim to believe that they have the last message of mercy to give the world are attracted by worldly fashions, and make great exertions to follow them as far as they think their profession of faith allows them to go. Worldly dress among our people is so noticeable that unbelievers frequently remark, \"In their dress you cannot distinguish them from the world.\"  This we know to be true, although there are many exceptions.",
