    "word": "The life of a Christian is a life regulated by the Word of God just as it reads. All the truths of the Old and the New Testaments form a complete whole. These truths we are to cherish, believe, and obey. To the true disciple, faith in God's Word is a living, active principle; for \"with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\" (Romans 10:10). By faith man believes that he receives the righteousness of Christ.",
