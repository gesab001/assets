    "word": "Those whom you suppose to be your friends may love the halfhearted, unconsecrated, unchristlike life you are living. They may through their association with you encourage you to think that in order to be happy you must have pleasurable enjoyments called innocent amusements, but masked by Satan to destroy your spirituality and theirs. They cannot pay a ransom for your soul, neither can you pay a ransom for theirs. Everyone who is saved must be saved by his faith in Jesus Christ. . . .",
