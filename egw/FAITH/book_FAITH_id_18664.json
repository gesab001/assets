    "word": "Those who hold fast their faith unto the end will come forth from the furnace of trial as fine gold seven times purified. Of this work the prophet Isaiah says, \"I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir\" (Isaiah 13:12). When in trouble, remember that faith tried in the furnace of affliction is more precious than gold tried with fire. Remember that there is One watching every movement, to see when the last particle of dross is taken away from your character.--Manuscript 110, Oct. 5, 1901, \"The Christian's Hope.\"",
