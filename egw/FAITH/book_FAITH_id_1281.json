    "word": "We have too little faith. We limit the Holy One of Israel. We should be grateful that God condescends to use any of us as His instruments. For every earnest prayer put up in faith for anything, answers will be returned. They may not come just as we have expected; but they will come--not perhaps as we have devised, but at the very time when we most need them. But, oh, how sinful is our unbelief! \"If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\" John 15:7.",
