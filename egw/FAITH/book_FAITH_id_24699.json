    "word": "The writers who are quoted in articles discussing these subjects are much pleased to have their views thus introduced to our people. But this is sowing tares.

They are to present the reasons of our faith, and never reproduce the seductive heresies that will continually appear. No time or study is to be given to these seducing theories. The enemy stands close beside those who proclaim his sentiments.",
