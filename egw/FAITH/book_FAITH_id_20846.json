    "word": "Sister Daniels has lessons to learn in economy. I saw that you, Brother Daniels, had been tested by poverty, and that the Lord would test you with prosperity. If your use of his blessings and the advantages he gives you should not be in accordance with your faith and your instructions to others; if you should not appropriate the means God brings in your hands, in accordance to your faith, then he would come closer to you by affliction, disappointment, and privations; for I saw that you do not know yourself. You would be led on by your natural inclinations, building high hopes on future prospects, but God would put his hand against you. He can in a moment remove your wisdom. He can in \n\n                      [3] \n\na moment take from you the power he has intrusted to you, by which you should glorify him. If left to yourself, to follow your own will and judgment, you will surely ruin your soul. Both you and your wife need to learn in the school of Christ.",
