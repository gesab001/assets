    "word": "God is not glorified by those whom He has called out of darkness into His marvelous light being untidy, careless, and slovenly. We want to copy the heavenly Pattern as far as order and neatness are concerned, and, if heaven is desirable and attractive, I want that my premises shall be attractive in their simplicity and order. We all need to consider that thoroughness, neatness, and order should prevail among those who love and fear God, for in this we are recommending our faith.",
