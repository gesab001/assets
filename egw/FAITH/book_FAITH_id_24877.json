    "word": "The evidence of the soon coming of Christ is right upon us, and many of us are asleep. We do not half gather up the important truths that are for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. If we did receive and believe the Word of God, we should be farther in advance spiritually than we are today. Iniquity abounds everywhere, and the love of many has waxed cold. Unless we understand the importance of the moments that are swiftly passing into eternity, and make ready a people to stand in the great day of God, we shall be registered in the books of heaven as unfaithful stewards. The watchman is to know the time of the night. Everything is now \n\n\n                                     -291- \n\nclothed with a solemnity that all who believe the truth should feel and sense. They should act in reference to the great day of God. The plagues of God are already just upon the world, and we need to be preparing for that great day. We have not time now to spend in speculative ideas, or in hap-hazard movements. We should fear to skim the surface of the Word of God. When the light shines in our hearts, we shall, by all our words and works, live in accordance with that light, understand the words of God, and make it our spiritual, daily food, as represented by Christ as eating His flesh and drinking His blood. Then we will be prepared to teach the Word of God as we never have done before. We must sink the shaft deeper in the mines of truth. All the little things of life are but a mote now. Those that pertain to eternity are of great consequence.--Ms. 41a, 1896. (Written Dec. 20, 1896, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, N.S.W.) (MR 900.24)",
