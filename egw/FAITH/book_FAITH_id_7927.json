    "word": "A Commendation for Soul Winners \n\n     There will be a blessed commendation, a holy benediction, on the faithful winners of souls. They will join the rejoicing ones in heaven, who shout the harvest home. How great will be the joy when the redeemed of the Lord shall all meet, gathered into the mansions prepared for them! Oh, what rejoicing for all who have been impartial, unselfish laborers together with God in carrying forward His work in the earth! What satisfaction \n                                                                           135\nwill every reaper have when the clear, musical voice of Jesus shall be heard, saying, \"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world\"! . . .",
