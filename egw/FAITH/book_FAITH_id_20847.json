    "word": "Our conflict with Satan and his host must be earnest and determined. The enemy will use these rebellious ones to worry, confuse, and perplex those who would stand as bold, faithful soldiers for Jesus. We wish you to understand your danger, to know what gins and snares Satan has set for you. The warfare is waging now, and will continue to the end. The church must be a unit. I wish, my brother, that you had spiritual discernment, but in this you are deficient. I entreat you in the name of Jesus to seek wisdom from God; for Satan is surely coming to you as an angel of light. It is not easy to meet and withstand foes who wear the same dress as do the soldiers of Christ. But let the Lord come in and work with your efforts. God would have you and your wife consecrated to his service, but you both need divine enlightenment, you need to be careful with whom you connect, to take heed whom you admit into your confidence. The Lord will help you if you feel the need of his help. But he is found only of those who seek him with faith, in earnest, humble prayer. May the Lord guide and control you is my prayer. \n          Yours with love,       Ellen G. White. \n\n\n                      [8]",
