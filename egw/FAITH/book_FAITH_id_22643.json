    "word": "It is time that we planted our feet upon the Rock of Ages. To give the impression that our faith and our religion is not a dominating power over individual self in our lives is greatly to dishonor God. Thus we turn from His commandments, which are our life, and deny that He is our God and we His people. We are not to confederate with any pleasing philosophy. Some have lost themselves in the fog of deception. Clean, holy principles are to be maintained at any cost.",
