    "word": "To outward appearance, the enemies of truth were triumphing, but God's hand was moving unseen in the darkness.  God permitted His faithful servant to be placed where Christ could give him a more wonderful revelation of Himself, and of divine truth for the enlightenment of the churches.  In exiling John the enemies of truth had hoped to silence forever the voice of the faithful disciple; but on Patmos he received a message, the influence of which his enemies could not destroy, and which was to continue to strengthen the church to the end of time.  Though not released from the responsibility of their wrong act, those who exiled John became instruments in the hands of God to carry out His purpose; and the very effort to extinguish the light placed the truth in bold relief. \n                                                                           174",
