    "word": "Those who labor hardest to secure their own happiness are miserable. Those who forget self in their interest for others have reflected back upon their own hearts the light and blessings they dispense to them. It is our duty to work for Christ; all that we possess is given us by him. If it were not for his advance capital of grace, we should \n                                                                           14\nhave nothing to improve. All that we have is given us on trust. Yet when he rewards us with his approval, it is as though the merit were our own: \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" It is not the greatness of the work which we do, but the love and fidelity with which we do it, that wins the approval of the Saviour. It is the use which we make of our talents which determines our woe or weal. We may have faith to remove mountains, and understand all mysteries, and give our bodies to be burned, yet without charity--that love which finds utterance in good works, that feeds the hungry, clothes the naked, and visits the afflicted--we are \"as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.\"",
