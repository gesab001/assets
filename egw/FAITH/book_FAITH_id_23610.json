    "word": "The Lord has provided antidotes for disease in simple plants, [SEE FOOTNOTES ON PAGE 289 OF SELECTED MESSAGES, BOOK 2.] and these can be used by faith, with no denial of faith; for by using the blessings provided by God for our benefit we are cooperating with Him. He can use water and sunshine and the herbs which He has caused to grow, in healing maladies brought on by indiscretion or accident. We do not manifest a lack of faith when we ask God to bless His remedies. True faith will thank God for the knowledge of how to use these precious blessings in a way which will restore mental and physical vigor. \n\n\n                                     -249-",
