    "word": "If you are sick, you should call in a physician. But if you go to the Lord in faith, believing His promises and taking special care of yourself, He will give you strength and blessing. Take periods of rest. Husband the strength that God has given you. If during the summer the heat is very severe, you must not endanger your life by remaining in the city. The Lord does not require anyone to remain in a place at the risk of health and life.",
