    "word": "In Acts 20:17-35 we see outlined the character of one Christian minister who faithfully performed his duty. He was an all-round minister. We do not consider that it is obligatory upon ministers to do in all respects as Paul did, yet we say to all that Paul was a Christian gentleman of the highest type. His example shows that mechanical toil does not necessarily lessen the influence of anyone, that working with the hands in any line of honorable labor should not make a man coarse and rough and uncourteous.",
