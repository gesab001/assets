    "word": "The Assurance of Salvation Now \n\n     The perishing sinner may say: \"I am a lost sinner; but Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost. He says, 'I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance' (Mark 2:17). I am a sinner, and He died upon Calvary's cross to save me. I need not remain a moment longer unsaved. He died and rose again for my justification, and He will save me now. I accept the forgiveness He has promised.\"--\"Justified by Faith\" (a pamphlet published in 1893), p. 7. Reprinted in Selected Messages, book 1, p. 392.",
