    "word": "Parents Must Say \"No\" to Temptation.--Mothers, by not following the practices of the world, you may set before your children an example of faithfulness to God, and so teach them to say no. Teach your children the meaning of the precept, \"If sinners entice thee, consent thou not.\" But if you would have your children able to say no to temptation, you yourself must be able to say no. It is as needful for the man to say no, as for the child.",
