    "word": "Let us trust fully, humbly, unselfishly, in God. We are His little children, and thus He deals with us. When we draw near to Him, He mercifully preserves us from the assaults of the enemy. Never will He betray one who trusts in Him as a child trusts in its parents. He sees the humble, trusting souls drawing near to Him, and in pity and love He draws near to them, and lifts up for them a standard against the enemy. \"Touch them not,\" He says, \"for they are mine. I have graven them upon the palms of my hands.\" He teaches them to exercise unquestioning faith in His power to work in their behalf. With assurance they say, \"This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\" 1 John 5:4.",
