    "word": "The most solemn promises were made to me by Brother C. H. Jones that if I would reduce the royalty on \"Great Controversy\" to ten cents, the Pacific Press would push the book with all their power. Yet in spite of these promises \"Bible Readings\" was brought in, and being sold cheap hindered the sale of the books that God had commanded to be written, that the light of truth might be given to the world, to prepare a people for the great day of God. Every appeal was made that I could make, but without effect. . Stoutly and strangely was the unjust work carried forward. Brother C. H. Jones thought he did not do the right thing by me but he must follow the lead of B.C. At the conference at Minneapolis, in the autumn of 1888, Captain Eldridge faithfully promised me that he would take hold of these works and push them the next spring. Did he do it? No, they were kept back decidedly, determinedly, and your voice did much to accomplish this; you discouraged their sale, and exalted \"Bible Readings\", and the influence of Captain Eldridge was united with yours. I have forgiven you this, and mention this matter that you may understand what the reference to selfishness means.",
