    "word": "The Lord asks us to walk with Him, to cleave constantly to Him. If we follow Him in faithfulness, He will be our wisdom. Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Let our faith grow stronger as we think of the tender watchcare of the Lord, and His lovingkindness toward us. Our faith must pierce the cloud, and reach to the light beyond. However dark the cloud, we should always see the light on the other side. Our love increases as our faith becomes more certain, for we touch the Source of an abiding strength and confidence.",
