    "word": "In the Garden of Gethsemane, Christ prayed to His Father, saying, \"O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me\" (Matthew 26:39). The cup which He prayed should be removed from Him, that looked so bitter to His soul, was the cup of separation from God in consequence of the sin of the world. . . . \"Nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt\" (Matthew 26:39). The spirit of submission that Christ manifested in offering up His prayer before God is the spirit that is acceptable to God. Let the soul feel its need, its helplessness, its nothingness; let all its energies be called forth in an earnest desire for help, and help will come. . . . Let faith pierce the darkness. Walk with God in the dark as well as in the light, repeating the words, \"He is faithful that promised\" (Hebrews 10:23). Through the trial of our faith we shall be trained to trust in God.",
