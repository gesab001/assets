    "word": "I want to tell you that Christ lives. He makes intercession for us, and He will save every one who will come to Him in faith and obey His directions. But remember that He does not want you to give your energies to criticism of your brethren. Attend to the salvation of your own soul. Do the work God has given you. You will find so much to do that you will have no inclination to criticize someone else. Use the talent of speech to help and bless. If you do the work God has given you, you will understand what is meant by the sanctification of the Spirit.",
