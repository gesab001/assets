    "word": "There is a great work to be done. The truth for this time is to go forth with simplicity and yet with power. It is to be told in words that will be understood by all classes, that all may be blessed thereby. Even the unlearned are to comprehend the precious lessons which the Lord desires us to teach.

He will make the words of the faithful worker so impressive that the hearers will have no excuse for saying, I did not understand what the message meant. . . .",
