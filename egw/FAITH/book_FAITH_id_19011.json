    "word": "The Spirit that reveals also works in him the fruits of righteousness. Christ is in him \"a well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (John 4:14). He is a branch of the True Vine, and bears rich clusters of fruit to the glory of God. What is the character of the fruit borne? \"The fruit of the Spirit is love.\" Mark the words--love, not hatred; it is joy, not discontent and mourning; peace, not irritation, anxiety, and manufactured trials. It is \"longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law\" (Galatians 5:22, 23).",
