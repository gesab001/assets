    "word": "Positive\n \n\n     Let us show that we have a living hope.--I have been referred by the Spirit of God to the many encouragements given to us in the Psalm. If more\n196\nof our ministers were filled with soul-longings for God, His people would take hold of these encouragements, and thanksgiving and praise would flow from human lips. Encouragement and hope would come to many souls who are now weary and discouraged. If our people would realise the possibilities that lie in increased faith and prayer, there would be a decided change in our churches. Those who are now downcast and worried, would be lifted up from their discouragements, and would rejoice in the Lord. Brethren and sisters, let us show that we have a living hope, that our service is a living service.--AUCR Apr. 29, 1907.",
