    "word": "Men wonder at the course of Judas who sold his Lord for thirty pieces of silver; but are not similar sins still committed by those who have the name of being the disciples of Christ? Do not men, yes, physicians, consider themselves at liberty, through pretense and sophistry originating from the suggestions of Satan, to sell their honor [and] sacrifice integrity in order to secure some worldly advantage? Do they not resort to policy, [and] work in an underhand manner, to bring about certain plans that deny their faith and separate the God of Israel from them? This kind of ingenious sinning is common in the health institutions.",
