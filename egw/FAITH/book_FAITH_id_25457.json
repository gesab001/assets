Shall he not covet the best and most enduring substance? Shall he not seek the crown of glory that is imperishable, the riches which moth and rust doth not corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal?

He has a soul longing for the heavenly riches, an intense desire which will not suffer him to be idle. His business on the earth is to secure eternal riches. He cannot, will not consent, after tasting of the heavenly gifts of God, to be a pauper, left in destitution for eternity. The soul passion is more, more. This is the real want of the soul.
