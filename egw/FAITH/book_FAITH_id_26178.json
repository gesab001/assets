    "word": "If some continue, as they have been doing, to speak idle, foolish, and -- I am sorry to say -- profane words, they will block the way to their advancement. \"Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.\" Teachers have a responsibility that they do not sense as they should. As they see the spirit that is working in the children of disobedience, they have perplexity and heartache. They do not want to appear harsh and severe; but unless they watch for souls as they that must give account, unless they are faithful and true to their trust, they will prove themselves to be unfaithful stewards. Students, you can make it hard for them. By your conduct you can cause them sadness of heart as they carry the terrible load of responsibility, while you go on, \n\n\n                                   - 99 - \n\nheedless and careless; or you can help your teachers to help you to advance in a knowledge of Christian obligations. Thus you can make this school one of the best that has ever been held. It rests with you to decide whether you will be thought unworthy and unfit to remain in the school, or whether you will be an ornament to it. One thing cannot be allowed. The rooms that have been dedicated to God must not be defiled by your improper conversation and lawless course of action. Let all heed the words spoken to the Hebrews: \"Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.\"",
