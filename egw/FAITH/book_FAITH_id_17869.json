    "word": "I am instructed to say to you, \"Trust not in self, but trust in God. This is the measure by which we are judged in the sight of heaven--our faith in God. Seek earnestly to work the works of God. Ever maintain the simplicity of true godliness. \"He that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul\" (Proverbs 8:36). Study the Scriptures; for there is nothing that will so firmly establish your faith in God or your belief in His truth, as this. If you will have faith in God, you cannot fail of coming out victorious.",
