    "word": "Great dishonor is shown to God in the lack of faith and respect that is manifested for one another. Christ's likeness must be cherished. God can not use to his name's glory those who are self-satisfied. We must advance but it must be done with great consideration. God's work must not bear the imperfections of man. We must move solidly and healthfully, doing a work that will not need to be raveled out because of dropped stitches.",
