    "word": "Christ counted it essential to remind His people that obedience to the commandments of God is for their present and future good. Obedience brings a blessing, disobedience a curse. Besides, when the Lord in a special manner favors His people, He exhorts them publicly to acknowledge His goodness. In this way His name will be glorified; for such an acknowledgment is a testimony that His words are faithful and true. \"Thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee\" (Deuteronomy 26:11).",
