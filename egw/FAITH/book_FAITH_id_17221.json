    "word": "All Ability is from God \n\n     There are those who are not learned and who have not a large endowment of gifts, but they need not become discouraged because of this. Let them use what they have, faithfully guarding every weak point in their characters, seeking by divine grace to make it strong. There is no man living that has any power or ability which he has not received from God, and the source from whence it came is open to the weakest human being. If he will draw near to God, the unfailing source of strength, he will realize that God fulfills His promise. But in this work, we need not call men thousands of miles to give us aid; for Christ has promised, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find.\"",
