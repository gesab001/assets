    "word": "God expects His church to discipline and fit its members for the work of enlightening the world. But let no one feel that because he is not educated he can not be expected to take part in the work. God has a work for you to do. He has given to every man his work. You can search the Scriptures for yourself. \"The entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\" The prayer of the sincere heart, offered in faith, will be heard in heaven.",
