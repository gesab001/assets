    "word": "The enemy of righteousness left nothing undone in his effort to stop the work committed to the Lord's builders. But God \"left not himself without witness\" (Acts 14:17). Workers were raised up who ably defended the faith once delivered to the saints. History bears record to the fortitude and heroism of these men. Like the apostles, many of them fell at their post, but the building of the temple went steadily forward. The workmen were slain, but the work advanced.",
