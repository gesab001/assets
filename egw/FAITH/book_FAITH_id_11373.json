    "word": "Chap. 5 - Daniel in the Lions' Den\n\n     When Darius took possession of the throne of Babylon, he at once proceeded to reorganize the government. He \"set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes . . . ; and over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first\" (Daniel 6:1, 2). And \"Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm\" (verse 3). The honors bestowed upon Daniel excited the jealousy of the leading men of the kingdom. The presidents and princes sought to find occasion for complaint against him. \"But they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him\" (verse 4).",
