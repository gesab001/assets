    "word": "Oh, that we will have the meekness and lowliness of Christ! My dear brother in Christ, we will not allow Satan to triumph by expressing one doubt of the love of God for us. We may suffer sickness and bereavement, \n\n\n                                  -268- \n\nbut God is our loving heavenly Father still, and we will not murmur. In trouble, however trying, let us heed the precious words of encouragement. \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\" This is the privilege of all God's people. The promise is not for a favored few. Jesus lives, my brother. He will go with you over the broad waters. Your faith will be tried; but you must believe, believe, believe. Cling to the arm of infinite power. God's hand will hold you more firmly than you can hold to Him. While you trust in Him, He will never let you go or leave you to perish. May the Lord bless you day by day is the prayer of you sister, Ellen G. White.--Letter 52, 1894. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. February 13, 1986. Entire Letter.",
