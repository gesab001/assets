    "word": "Workings of an Unsanctified Heart. Dear Brother Butler. [THIS LETTER WAS SENT TO ELDER GEORGE I. BUTLER, THE GENERAL CONFERENCE PRESIDENT, BUT ELLEN WHITE ALSO DIRECTLY ADDRESSES ELDER H, THE GUILTY MINISTER]I am troubled in regard to Elder H. He writes me nothing, and I feel deeply pained on his account. It seems sometimes to me that the Lord is testing us to see whether we will deal faithfully in regard to sin in one of our honored men. The time is close at hand when the General Conference \n                                                                           186\nwill have to decide the points whether or not to renew his credentials.",
