A much broader work would have been accomplished there had our people moved forward in faith and self-denial. It was God\u2019s design that Huntsville should have convenient school buildings and a sanitarium for the colored people. This sanitarium building has become a positive necessity. Some of the brethren have been free to give their advice concerning this institution, saying that it should be \u201ca small sanitarium.\u201d The advice I have had to give has been that we should have a modest but roomy sanitarium, where the sick can be taken in and treated. The colored race should have the\n162\nbenefits of such an institution as verily as should the white people.",
