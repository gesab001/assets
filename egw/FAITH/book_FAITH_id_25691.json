    "word": "On Sabbath [Jan. 3] I spoke from Matthew 11:16-27. I made a decided application of this lesson to those who had great light, precious opportunities, and wonderful privileges, and yet their spiritual growth and advancement was not in accordance with the blessings of the light and knowledge given of God. There was a solemn impression made upon the congregation, and fully two thousand persons were present. I had great freedom in speaking. In the afternoon the meetings were divided, and I hear there were excellent meetings in these divisions. Monday [Jan. 5] Elder Smith came to me and we had an earnest, faithful talk, I could see that he had a very different spirit from that he had months ago. He was not hard and unimpressible; he felt the words I spoke to him, laying before \n                                                                           852\nhim faithfully the course he had taken, and the harm he had done through this position. He said he wanted to come into harmony with the testimonies of the Spirit of God. I had written to him thirteen pages [Dec. 31, 1890] and sent them to him--very plain words. Tuesday [Jan. 6] he called again to see me and asked if I would meet with a select few, that he had something to say. I told him I would. Yesterday, Wednesday [Jan. 7], the meeting was held in my room in the office, and Elder Smith read the letter I had sent him, read it to them all, and said he accepted it as from the Lord. He went back to the Minneapolis meeting and made a confession of the spirit he had occupied, casting on me very heavy burdens. Brother Rupert confessed also, and we had a very profitable, excellent meeting.",
