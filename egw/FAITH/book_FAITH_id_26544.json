    "word": "Never Be Discouraged \n\n     Whatever may arise, never be discouraged. The Lord loves us, and He will perform His Word. Try to encourage in the patients a trust in God. Bid them be of good courage. Talk hope, even to the last. If they are to die, let them die praising the Lord. He ever lives; and though some of His faithful followers may fall in death, their works will follow them, and theirs will be a joyous awakening in the resurrection morning.",
