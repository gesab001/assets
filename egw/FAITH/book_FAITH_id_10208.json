    "word": "PRAYER WILL PREVAIL AGAINST SATAN.\u2014The prayer of faith is the great strength of the Christian and will assuredly prevail against Satan. This is why he insinuates that we have no need of prayer. The name of Jesus, our Advocate, he detests; and when we earnestly come to Him for help, Satan\u2019s host is alarmed. It serves his purpose well if we neglect the exercise of prayer, for then his lying wonders are more readily received.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, 296.)",
