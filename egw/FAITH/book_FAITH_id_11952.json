    "word": "Trust in Christ Essential--1879.--Christ has been loved by you, although your faith has sometimes been feeble and your prospects confused. But Jesus is your Saviour. He does not save you because you are perfect, but because you need Him and in your imperfection have trusted in Him. Jesus loves you, my precious child. You may sing, \"Under the shadow of Thy throne Still may we dwell secure; Sufficient is Thine arm alone, And our defense is sure.\"--Letter 46, 1879.",
