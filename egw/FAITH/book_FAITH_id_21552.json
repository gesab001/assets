    "word": "Willie, I must tell you about Margaret's cats. She has two cats just alike. They are just the color of a rat, Maltese color. Sister Folsom takes a piece of meat and holds it up to her shoulder and the kitties will give a spring and climb to the top of her shoulder for the meat and then get down and eat it. These kitties are good, faithful kitties. They catch great big rats. They don't eat them, but bite off their heads and leave them.",
