    "word": "We Are to Follow No One but Christ--When Christ told Peter what should come upon him because of his faith, Peter turned to John, and asked, \"Lord, and what shall this man do?\" The Lord said, \"What is that to thee? Follow thou Me\" (John 21:21, 22). If Elder C or Elder D should reject the message of truth that the Lord has sent to the people of this time, would their unbelief make the message error?--No. We are to follow no one but Christ. If men who have occupied leading positions feel at liberty to despise the message and the messenger, their unbelief is no excuse for others. Our salvation is an individual work. Neither Brother C, Brother D, nor any other mortal man can pay a ransom for my soul or yours in the day of judgment. In that day there will be no excuse to offer for neglecting to receive the message the Lord sent you. . . .",
