    "word": "Now let the love of God flow out of our hearts for the gift of His Son. It is our work to come out of darkness and grasp the rays of light that continue to shine upon our pathway, and thus in turn let them shine upon the pathway of others. We have great light. Shall it be established at Nimes? Let us cling to the mighty arm of Jesus by faith and obedience and stand firm for truth, and then we shall know of the doctrine.--Ms 45, 1886, pp. 1-5. (\"God's Law the Standard of Character,\" sermon at Nimes, France, Oct. 23, 1886.)",
