    "word": "And again I say, \"Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon\" [Isaiah 55:6, 7]. Go to work and confess your sins before God. Seek God, for you know but very little of this kind of work. Put your thoughts to work upon pure, holy subjects. Tax your powers. Send your supplications to heaven in earnest contrition of soul. Let your conversation, your thoughts, your deportment, be in harmony with the holy faith you claim to be defending. And when all like yourself shall repent and find the pardoning love of God, we shall see that God will work in a wonderful manner with His people. Sinners will be converted; backsliders will be reclaimed. \n\n\n                                      -145-",
