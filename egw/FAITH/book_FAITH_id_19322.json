    "word": "Character of Christ. \n\n     We are privileged to see Jesus as he is, to know him as One who is full of compassion, courteousness, and divine politeness. He is good and merciful, and will forgive our sins. Of him it is written, \"Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.\" We should cherish love and gratitude, we should look unto Jesus, and become transformed into his image. The result of this will be increased confidence, hope, patience, and courage. We shall be drinking of the water of life of which Christ spoke to the woman of Samaria. He said, \"If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. . . . Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\"",
