    "word": "(734) Acting under the advice of these communications, steps were taken to establish the Loma Linda College of Evangelists. This was opposed by some and a communication was sent of which the following is an extract,--\"Be very careful not to do anything that would restrict the work at Loma Linda. It is in the order of God that this property has been secured, and He has given instruction that a school should be connected with the sanitarium. A special work is to be done there in qualifying young men and young women to be efficient medical missionary workers. They are to be taught how to treat the sick without the use of drugs. Such an education requires an experience in practical work. The work at Loma Linda demands immediate consideration. Preparations must be made for the school to be opened as soon as possible. Our young men and young women are to find in Loma Linda a school where they can receive a medical missionary training, and where they will not be brought under the influence of some who are seeking to undermine the truth. The students are to unite faithfully in the medical work, keeping their physical powers in the most perfect condition possible, and laboring under the instruction of the great medical Missionary. The healing of the sick, and the ministry of the word, are to go hand in hand.\" In harmony with this instruction, the school was established with a three years' medical evangelistic course, supplemented by a strong three years' nurses course, designed to qualify workers with all the ability of physicians, in harmony with the testimonies given.",
