    "word": "The important truths of practical godliness must be presented. The people must be made to realize that faith and love must be brought into the soul; for it is the exercise of these graces that will give the proper training to the soul. Christ must be formed within, the hope of glory. These things must be taught, line upon line, and precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little. The holiness and consecration which Christ requires of his followers, must ever be kept before the mind.",
