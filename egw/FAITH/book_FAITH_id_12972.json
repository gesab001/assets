    "word": "We are to have free access to the atoning blood of Christ. This we must regard as the most precious privilege, the greatest blessing, ever granted to sinful man. And how little is made of this great gift! How deep, how wide and continuous is this stream. To every soul thirsting after holiness there is repose, there is rest, there is the quickening influence of the Holy Spirit, and then the holy, happy, peaceful walk and precious communion with Christ. Then, O then, can we intelligently say with John, \"Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.\" Talk it, pray it. Let it be the theme of sacred song,--to be washed, to be cleansed; the believing soul claims that love, and by its virtues stands before the throne of God pardoned, justified, sanctified. . . . Its cleansing virtue gives strength and vigor to faith, power to prayer, and happiness in cheerful obedience. \n                                                                           225",
