    "word": "The noble life which Christ has made it possible for us to live--one of obedience and service--makes us partakers of the divine nature. Cannot we experience the inner strength of piety which animated Jesus Christ? \"I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\" That life will reveal that it is a part of Christ's life, wearing Christ's yoke, lifting His burdens. The transformation of the human character makes the yoke of Christ easy and His burden light. Through faith everyone can, if he will, become one with Christ in his obedience and his service.",
