    "word": "In return for so infinite a sacrifice, what are we willing to do for Christ? The Father has given to His Son all heaven, that we may have every opportunity of overcoming the enemy. To us are granted heaven's richest gifts; but how often we fail to reach up and grasp them by living faith! We would have much more strength to resist temptation if we would exercise greater faith. We should cherish and cultivate the faith that works by love and purifies the soul.",
