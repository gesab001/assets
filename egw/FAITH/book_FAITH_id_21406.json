    "word": "There was instruction given by the One whose hands held the records and whose eyes were tracing every feature of the records. His words were, You cannot trust in your own human ability or wisdom. You must have union of effort, union of faith; and you must counsel together. Not one of you is sufficient to be a leader. God will work for His people if they will give Him a chance--give Him their hearts and minds.",
