    "word": "Those who are admitted as nurses should be firm in the faith. No trifling ones, no persons of superficial character are to be taken in for one light, frivolous mind may be used by Satan to do mischief which few can anticipate. Such ones misrepresent the high standard of righteousness. There are those who are easily influenced by them, and together, by their foolish talking, their loud laughing, their love of amusements, they injure the reputation of the institution. The patients are disgusted by their indecorous conduct. Those who have any part to act in our sanitariums are to be circumspect. They are to act like men and women who carry grave responsibilities.--Ms 104, 1901, pp. 5, 6. (\"The Need of a Reform,\" October 8, 1901.)",
