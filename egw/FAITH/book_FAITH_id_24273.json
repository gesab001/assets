    "word": "MR No. 1478 - The Need for Simplicity and Consecration in School Work\n\n     This morning I will put my trust in God. We have had much consultation in regard to our future work, for, as we consider matters, perplexities present themselves. Our school work is a very important, sacred work. It must advance, but its simplicity must and will prove its success. The light given me is that the crib must not be placed too high. We must have the simplicity of the apostles. If we walk humbly with God in prayer and in faith, we can and will advance. But our hearts must blend in unity and love. Not one thread of selfishness must be woven into the school fabric. This is a missionary enterprise, and our counsel and help must come from God. We must pray; our hearts must be emptied of self; for just as soon as self gains the supremacy, the Spirit of God is quenched.",
