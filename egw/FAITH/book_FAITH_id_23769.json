    "word": "Why are we so dull of comprehension? Why do we not cling to Jesus, and draw from Him by faith the strength and perfection of His character as the vine-branch draws the sap from the living vine? We are to look to Jesus, and climb up step by step in the work of overcoming, as the temptations close us about. Abiding in Christ, we become one with Him. Then we are safe, entirely safe, against all the assaults of Satan. Christ living in the soul is revealed in the character. Man is nothing without Christ. But if Christ lives in us, we shall work the works of God. We shall represent Christ in our life. We shall talk of Christ because we meditate upon Him. We shall grow up into Christ to the full stature of men and women in spiritual understanding.",
