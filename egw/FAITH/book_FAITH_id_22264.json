    "word": "We hope that a most earnest effort will be made by our people in England to inspire their brethren in Scandinavia with courage and faith. Brethren, we must come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Do not, by word of unbelief call down the denunciation of God. Do not act like the priest and the Levite, who looked at the wounded man lying in his grievous condition, and passed by on the other side. Wake up, brethren. Let the work move forward with power. May the Lord help His people to do their best.--Ms 26, 1901, pp. 4, 5. (\"The Canvassing Work and the Scandinavian Institutions,\" March 5, 1901.) \n\nReleased April 28, 1976.",
