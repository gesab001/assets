    "word": "Jesus is perfect. Christ's righteousness is imputed unto them, and He will say, \"Take away the filthy garments from him, and clothe him with change of raiment.\" Jesus makes up for our unavoidable deficiencies. Where Christians are faithful to each other, true and loyal to the Captain of the Lord's host, never betraying trusts into the enemy's hands, they will be transformed into Christ's character. Jesus will abide in their hearts by faith.",
