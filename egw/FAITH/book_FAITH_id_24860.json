    "word": "You cannot keep the law. No. It is impossible for man of himself to keep the law. He cannot do it. But what can he do?

Here Satan is dethroned; he is emptied out of the house, and the vacuum is supplied by the righteousness of Jesus Christ. Christ sits enthroned in the human soul. Christ never wars against Christ.",
