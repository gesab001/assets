    "word": "The false and cruel words of discouragement spoken by the unfaithful spies were received by the people and excited them to desperation. They felt that they were greatly abused, and they mourned and lamented over themselves, and manifested distrust in God, forgetting His mighty works in delivering them from Egyptian bondage, opening the Red Sea before them, and destroying their pursuing foes. Let not one in our ranks be so ungrateful, so forgetful of God, as to repeat the sin of murmuring, rebellious Israel.",
