    "word": "God's people are on trial before the heavenly universe; but the scantiness of their gifts and offerings, and the feebleness of their efforts in God's service, mark them as unfaithful stewards. If what they are doing were the best they could do, condemnation would not come upon them; but with their resources they could do much more. \n                                                                           2\nThe world knows, and they know, that they have to a great degree lost the spirit of self-denial and cross-bearing.",
