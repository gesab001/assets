    "word": "\"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.\" There can be no misunderstanding here unless there is wilful blindness. We are to be holy and without blame before him in love. The condition upon which we receive an increase of grace is that we improve upon the light we already have. If we would find, we must go on continually seeking; if we would receive, we must continue to ask; if we would have the door opened, we must perseveringly knock. The responsibility of our own ruin will lie at our own door. The Word of God speaks to us as if everything depended upon our own efforts. We must come, we must resist the devil; we must strive to enter in at the strait gate; we must run the race with patience; we must fight the fight of faith; we must wrestle with principalities and powers; we must agonize before God in prayer, if we would stand blameless before the throne of God. We must have the faith that works, or it will be powerless. Good works will not pay the price of our redemption; they are the fruit of our faith in Jesus Christ, who is our righteousness.",
