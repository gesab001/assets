    "word": "Our sanitarium workers are required of God to stand on higher ground. They need to cultivate kindness and tenderness of heart. They need a strong determination and faith in Christ. This it is their privilege to have; and this is their eternal safety. The promise to them is, \"If ye do these \n                                                                           8\nthings ye shall never fall; for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\" These words were repeated three times: \"It is your eternal life insurance policy.\" If the workers will take hold of the faith of Christ, and in humbleness of mind seek daily to bring into the life-- into the words and actions--the sanctification imparted by the Spirit of God, they shall never fall. And this experience manifested in the life of the workers will make upon the minds of those who come into the institution, impressions for good which will be carried away with them. The light of heaven will come in, and it will shine into the hearts and minds of unbelievers, making impressions that will be a lasting influence for good in their lives.",
