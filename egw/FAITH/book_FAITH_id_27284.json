    "word": "If your faith in the word of God is strengthened, if you will fully accept the truths that have called us out of the world, and made us a people denominated by the Lord as his peculiar treasure, if you will unite with your brethren in standing by the old landmarks,--then there will be unity. But if you remain in unbelief, unsettled as to the true foundation of faith, there can be no more hope of unity in the future than there has been in the past.",
