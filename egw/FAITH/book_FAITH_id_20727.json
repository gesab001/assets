    "word": "The faith of Jesus and the testimony of Jesus are blended. They are to be clearly presented to the world. But in God's word we are shown the consequences of proclaiming this message. \"The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\" A refusal to obey the commandments of God, and a determination to cherish hatred against those who proclaim these commandments, leads to the most determined war on the part of the dragon, whose whole energies are brought to bear against the commandment-keeping people of God. \"He causeth all, \n\n\n                         -7- \n\nboth small and great . . . to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.\" Not only are men not to work with their hands on Sunday, but with their minds are they to acknowledge Sunday as the Sabbath. \"And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\"",
