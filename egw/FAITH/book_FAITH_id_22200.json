    "word": "This recent apostasy has been a great trial to us, and has largely increased my burdens and writing. It has hurt my soul. But having done all, we must stand. Paul wrote to Timothy, \"As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith; so do. Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned; from which some having swerved, have turned aside unto vain jangling; desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm. . . . Now unto the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; holding faith and a good conscience; which some having put away, concerning faith have made shipwreck.\"",
