    "word": "It was to impress Abraham\u2019s mind with the reality of the gospel, as well as to test his faith, that God commanded him to slay his son. The agony which he endured during the dark days of that fearful trial was permitted that he might understand from his own experience something of the greatness of the sacrifice made by the infinite God for humanity\u2019s redemption. No other test could have caused Abraham such torture of soul as did the offering of his son. . . . What stronger proof can be given of the infinite compassion and love of God? \u201cHe that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\u201d (Romans 8:32).\u2014Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 153, 154.",
