    "word": "In our institutions and in all our work there is need of conscientious, godly men, men who have been wrestlers in their life work, who have maintained faith and a clear conscience, men who are seeking, not for the applause of the people but for the favor of God, men through whom the Lord can work. We want men who will make it their first business to wrestle with God in prayer, and then go forth in the wisdom of the inspiration that God can give. Then we are a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. If men would not have their minds darkened, their hearts hardened, they must obey God at any cost to themselves. They are not only to pray to God, but to act their prayers.",
