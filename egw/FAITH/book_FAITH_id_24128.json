If this purpose of the devil could only be carried out, then [it] appears to you [that] your work would be considered as most wonderful in conception.

There would be a representation given to the outsiders not of our faith just what would suit them, that would develop traits of character which would cause great confusion and occupy the golden moments which should be used zealously to bring the great message before the people. The presentations upon any subject we have worked upon could not all harmonize, and the results would be to confuse the minds of believers and unbelievers. This is the very thing that Satan had planned that should take place--anything that could be magnified as a disagreement.",
