I read it and I am thankful that you view things in a clear light. I have felt deeply in reference to your case, and I feel sincerely to sympathize with all your sorrows and disappointments. With this I send you copies of letters written in regard to Byron's death. We counted much upon Byron and Sarah. They have been true believers in the truth, ready to be anything or do anything that the Lord would have them do. Byron won the esteem of all who were acquainted with him, and his death has pained me sore, for I loved him as I loved my own son, and I loved Sarah as a daughter. Well, faithful, true hands are folded over his breast, and his eyes are closed to see and grieve over the painful view of wickedness no more. When these eyes shall again open it will be to behold the King in his beauty.",
