    "word": "The workers gave their time, receiving nothing so far as money is concerned, but receiving a reward of infinitely greater value. Individual action brought a consciousness of well-doing. Those who engaged in the work improved in health of body and health of mind. They gained an experience that made their hearts glad in the Lord. They had no time to speak needless words.

A happy enthusiasm filled the hearts of the workers.",
