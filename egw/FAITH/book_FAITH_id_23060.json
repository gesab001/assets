    "word": "If those who are placed in responsible positions are faithful, living in daily communion with Christ, they will learn to place the same estimate upon man that God does. Personal preferences manifested for a few will give way to a true spirit of charity toward all. You know not whom God may have chosen to be heirs of His kingdom. They may be the very ones you would not think at all qualified for the work. The great Shepherd will call His own sheep by name, [and] one by one will lead them out. The men upon whom you place so low an estimate may be those whom God will choose to do a special work for Him, notwithstanding your judgment to the contrary.",
