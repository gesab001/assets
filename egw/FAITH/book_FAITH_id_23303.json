    "word": "The work of the ministry is to retain its sacred, holy character. Disappointing results may be seen, as in Christ's day in the case of Judas. And Paul mentions some who departed from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits. Others for love of gain left the work in which the apostles took such an interest and carried forward with such rejoicing. But although errors may have to be corrected, although some of the workers cause great sorrow, yet the ministry is not to be belittled or ignored.",
