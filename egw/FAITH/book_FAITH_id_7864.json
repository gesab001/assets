    "word": "Time to Advance \n\n     It behooves every soul whose life is hid with Christ in God to come to the front now. Something is to be done. We are to contend most earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. The spirit in which truth is defended and the kingdom of God advanced must be as it would be if Christ were on this earth in person. If He were here, He would be drawn out to render a solemn rebuke to many who claim to be medical missionaries, but who have not chosen to heed the injunction He has urged upon them, to learn of Him His meekness and lowliness of heart. In the lives of some of those who occupy the highest positions, self has been exalted. Until such ones rid themselves of every desire to uplift self, they cannot clearly discern the character and glory of the great Medical Missionary. . . .",
