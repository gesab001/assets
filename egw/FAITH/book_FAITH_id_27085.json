    "word": "I know I can say, Thou, Lord, hath made me Thy messenger. Thou, Lord, hast laid upon me great responsibilities in various lines, and I am grieving my soul because of my physical weakness. Thou hast commissioned me to speak the words Thou hast given me and declare with pen and with voice the things Thou hast shown me. I have tried and am trying to do this in messages of reproof, messages of warning, and also messages of encouragement; but my hope is failing, that those who are departing from the faith will receive the messages.",
