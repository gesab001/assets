    "word": "Dec. 16. I rise to write at two o'clock. What gives the proper level to the human mind? It is the cross of Calvary. By looking unto Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of our faith, all the desire for self-glorification is laid in the dust. There comes, as we see aright, a spirit of self-abasement that promotes lowliness and humbleness of mind. As we contemplate the cross, we are enabled to see the wonderful provision it has brought to every believer. God in Christ and Christ as God, if seen aright, will level human exaltation and pride. There will be no self-exaltation, but there will be true humility.",
