Paul's prayer to God for the Ephesians was, \"That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with all might by His Spirit in the inner man: That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith: that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height: And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God\" (Ephesians 3:16-19).--Ms 24, 1900, p. 9.
