    "word": "Dear Brother and Sister Haskell, I am so glad that God manifests through you His power and His grace in favor of the truth. I hope that you will be sustained and strengthened and blessed. And you surely will be if you walk humbly with God. Be of good courage. God's providence will certainly open your way and give you precious victories. It is our duty to place ourselves where God has signified we should be. He was in your going to New York City, working just as you have been working for those not of our faith.--Letter 132, 1901, pp. 2, 7, 8. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, October 7, 1901.)",
