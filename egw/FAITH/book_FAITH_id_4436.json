    "word": "Many who profess to believe in Christ do not wear His yoke. They think that they do, but if they were not deluded and deceived by Satan, they would have thoughts corresponding with their faith, and with the great truths which they profess to believe. They would realize that the words of Christ mean something to them. \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" If you follow Jesus, you are His disciple; if you follow your own impulses, your own unsanctified heart, you say plainly, I want not Thy way, O Lord, but mine.",
