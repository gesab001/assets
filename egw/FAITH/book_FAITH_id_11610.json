    "word": "Look to Jesus \n\n     Let the soul look to Jesus. \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). No one will be forced to look to Christ; but the voice of invitation is sounding in yearning entreaty, \"Look and live.\" In looking to Christ, we shall see that His love is without a parallel, that He has taken the place of the guilty sinner, and has imputed unto him His spotless righteousness. When the sinner sees his Saviour dying upon the cross under the curse of sin in his stead, beholding His pardoning love, love awakes in his heart. The sinner loves Christ, because Christ has first loved him, and \n                                                                           375\nlove is the fulfilling of the law. The repenting soul realizes that God \"is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" The Spirit of God works in the believer's soul, enabling him to advance from one line of obedience to another, reaching on from strength to greater strength, from grace to grace in Jesus Christ.",
