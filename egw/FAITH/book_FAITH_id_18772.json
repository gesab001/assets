    "word": "Unsanctified Words--The soul will never free itself to come into the clear, deep knowledge of the love of God until the speech is converted. The counterworking power of unsanctified, faithless, cheap words is the great hindrance to our prayers. God will draw nigh to every soul that will draw nigh to Him. But the Spirit of God will depart from those who leave the presence of God, and enter into vain conversation, speaking many words that are of no weight or purpose. The spiritual experience of such will stop abruptly.--Ms 74, 1897.",
