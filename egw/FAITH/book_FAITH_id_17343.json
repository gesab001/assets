    "word": "The sins marked out in the Word of God must not be allowed to enter the life, as of little consequence. If we would faithfully walk in the light of God's word and will, we must be determined that we will not dishonour God by a lax, loose course of action. It \n80\nis often the case that the customs and climate of a country make a condition of things that would not be tolerated in another country. Changes for the better must be made, but it is not best to be abrupt. The truth received into the heart sanctifies the receiver. The power of the grace of God will do more for the soul than controversy will do in a lifetime. By the power of the truth how many things might be adjusted, and controversies hoary with age find quietude in the admission of better ways. The great, grand principle, \u201cPeace on earth and good will to men,\u201d will be far better practised when those who believe in Christ are labourers together with God. Then all the little things which some are ever harping upon, which are not authoritatively settled by the Word of God, will not be magnified into important matters.",
