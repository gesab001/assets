    "word": "\u201cIn the highest rank of the enemies of the gospel of Christ,\u201d said Wesley, \u201care they who openly and explicitly \u2018judge the law\u2019 itself, and \u2018speak evil of the law;\u2019 who teach men to break (to dissolve, to loose, to untie the obligation of) not one only, whether of the least or of the greatest, but all the commandments at a stroke.\u201d  \u201cThe most surprising of all the circumstances that attend this strong delusion, is that they who are given up to it, really believe that they honor Christ by overthrowing his law, and that they are magnifying his office, while they are destroying his doctrine! Yea, they honor him just as Judas did, when he said, \u2018Hail, Master, and kissed him.\u2019 And he may as justly say to every one of them, \u2018Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?\u2019 It is no other than betraying him with a kiss, to talk of his blood, and take away his crown; to set light by any part of his law, under pretense of advancing his gospel. Nor indeed can anyone escape this charge, who preaches faith in any such a manner as either directly or indirectly tends to set aside any branch of obedience; who preaches Christ so as to \n264\ndisannul, or weaken in any wise, the least of the commandments of God.\u201d",
