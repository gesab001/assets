    "word": "Some have hesitated because they feared that the work outlined would require more means than was at their command. But I have urged our brethren to step forward by faith and follow the leadings of divine providence.

God's messengers need to awake from their lethargy and lay aside everything that may hinder the free course of the Holy Spirit in connection with their labors.",
