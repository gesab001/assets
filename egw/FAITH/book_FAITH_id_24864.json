God will deliver us and we may represent the character \n\n\n                                    -249- \n\nof Jesus Christ who died for the sins of the whole world. Let us, everyone, learn of Jesus. Take His yoke. Love Him because He first loved you, and we shall have a most precious victory by and by. He will open the gates of the city of God and bid us come in. He will welcome us and give us a heavenly benediction. To all who have tested their obedience that they will obey the law of God, He says, \"Well done thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" What is that joy? The joy of seeing sinners converted. They will be brought to Jesus Christ and this is His joy. We have been partakers with Jesus Christ. \"Laborers together with God.\" And thus we see that we can indeed be partakers of His glory, which shall be given to every faithful child of God.",
