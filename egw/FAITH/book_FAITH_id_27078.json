    "word": "Let none of our schools be conducted in a cheap, careless manner. He that is faithful in that which is least will be faithful also in that which is greater. If little things are left uncorrected, there is danger that larger evils will be regarded indifferently. The faithful steward of the Lord\u2019s treasure will correct at once the small mistakes. Whether his duties are connected with the cultivation of the Lord\u2019s land, or with the buildings that are erected on the land, he will do every stroke well. The Lord will take notice of his faithfulness, and He will strengthen the ability to plan and execute in temporal matters. And this faithful exactitude is a special necessity where eternal interests are involved.",
