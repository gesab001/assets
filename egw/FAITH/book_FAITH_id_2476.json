    "word": "The Power of Christlike Tenderness \n\n\n     The Lord Jesus Christ has infinite tenderness for those whom He has purchased at the cost of His own sufferings in the flesh, that they should not perish \n                                                                           81\nwith the devil and his angels, but that He may claim them as His chosen ones. They are the claims of His love, of His own property; and He looks upon them with unutterable affection, and the fragrance of His own righteousness He gives to His loved ones who believe in Him. It requires tact and wisdom and human love and sanctified affection for the precious lambs of the flock, to lead them to see and appreciate their privilege of yielding themselves up to the tender guidance of the faithful shepherds. The children of God will exercise the gentleness of Jesus Christ.",
