    "word": "\"Faithful teachers should be placed in charge of the Bible classes, -- teachers who will strive to make the students understand their lessons, not by explaining everything to them, (440) but by requiring them to explain clearly every passage they read. Let these teachers remember that little good will be accomplished by skimming over the surface of the Word. Thoughtful investigation and earnest, taxing study are required in order for this Word to be understood. . .",
