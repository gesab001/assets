    "word": "There needs to be a thorough reformation in our churches. The converting power of God upon the heart would mold the life and would make a wonderful transformation in the line of dress. Oh, that every believer in the truth would have the mold and superscription of Christ. Oh, that all would represent the character of Christ in meekness and lowliness of heart. If indeed they have the truth abiding in the heart how can they be silent and not tell that which they know of the love of Jesus? The trouble is that many do not have Christ abiding in their hearts; they have not a saving faith, therefore light does not shine forth from them.",
