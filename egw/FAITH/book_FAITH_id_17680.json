    "word": "The words spoken by Jesus Christ are to be repeated by those who believe them. Those who have genuine faith will make it evident by working for souls who are in darkness. . . . They will speak words of warning, of entreaty, and will point out the snow waters of Lebanon to those who are seeking to quench their thirst from the low streams of the valleys of the world. God calls for those who stand as soldiers under His blood-stained banner to go to work. He will clothe His messengers with divine power so that they may reach those who are perishing.",
