    "word": "You, my brother, know but little by personal experience of me and the work that the Lord has given me. But some of those who know of my experience, and who have had all the evidence that the Lord will ever give them, evade the truth when the straight testimony comes to rebuke some of their plans. They say, \"Someone has told Sister White.\" I cannot place any dependence on the faith of such ones in the Lord's word. When all is in their favor, they may appear to believe. But when the Lord in His mercy shows them that their course is not in accordance with truth and righteousness, when their plans are interfered with, they give way to unbelief, showing that they have no real confidence in the word of the Lord.",
