    "word": "God calls upon those who have exercised undue authority to take off from His workers every dominating hand. Let every one to whom has been entrusted sacred responsibilities seek to understand his individual duty before God, and do that duty humbly and faithfully. Let no one regard himself as a master, with controlling power to exercise over his brethren. The principles of the Word of God are to be taught and practised.",
