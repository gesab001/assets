    "word": "At the same time there should be in our business deal no shadow of selfishness or overreaching. Let no one take advantage of any man's ignorance or necessity by charging exorbitant prices for work done or for goods sold. There will be strong temptation to diverge from the straight path; there will be innumerable arguments in favor of conforming to custom and adopting practices that are really dishonest. Some urge that in dealing with sharpers one must conform to custom; that, should he maintain strict integrity, he could not carry on business and secure a livelihood. Where is our faith in God? He owns us as His sons and daughters on condition that we come out from the world and be separate, and touch not the unclean thing. To His institutions as well as to individual Christians are addressed the words, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,\" and His promise is sure that all things needed for this life shall be added.--7T 163, 164.",
