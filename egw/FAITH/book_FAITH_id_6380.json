    "word": "It would be a terrible thing to stand before God clothed in sinful garments, with His eye reading every secret of our lives. But through the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice we may stand before God pure and spotless, our sins atoned for and pardoned. \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9). The redeemed sinner, clothed in the robes of Christ's righteousness, may stand in the presence of a sin-hating God, made perfect by the merits of the Saviour.",
