But when his first answer was given to the tyrant Nero, he says, \"No man stood with me, but all men forsook me.\" A solitary prisoner, on trial for his life, persecuted and abandoned. But did Paul \n                                                                           12\nthink he was making a great sacrifice in his religious life?
