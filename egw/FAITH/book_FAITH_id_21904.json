    "word": "\"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\" (1 Corinthians 4:9). It is of the highest importance that Sabbathkeepers live out their faith in every particular. They should be prompt and neat, and keep their business matters all straight. If they believe the truth from the heart they will do this. The truth will, if carried out, reform their lives.--Ms 3, 1861, pp. 13, 14. (\"Testimony for Mill Grove Church,\" circa 1861.)",
