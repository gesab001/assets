    "word": "Our growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness\u2014all depend upon our union with Christ. It is by communion with Him, daily, hourly\u2014by abiding in Him\u2014that we are to grow in grace. He is not only the author, but the finisher of our faith. It is Christ first and last and always. He is to be with us, not only at the beginning and the end of our course, but at every step of the way. . . .",
