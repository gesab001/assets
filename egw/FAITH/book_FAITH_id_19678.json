    "word": "Suggestions have been made by some that it might be well to sell our property in Huntsville, and move the school to some other place, but I have been instructed \n                                                                           7\nthat this suggestion had its birth in unbelief. Our school in Huntsville is in a good location, and the large State Normal school for the training of colored teachers, which is carried on not far from there by those not of our faith, has created an influence in favor of educating the Negro, which our people should appreciate. We should have in Huntsville facilities for the education of a goodly number of students. We should have a primary school and a school for more advanced students. It would take years to build up in a new place the work that has already been done in Huntsville.",
