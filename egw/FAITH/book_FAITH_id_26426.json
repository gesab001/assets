    "word": "A good education in all phases of the truth means more than many of us realize. Yet with all the knowledge we may gain, we shall never realize the purpose of God for us, unless we become partakers of His divine nature. Where is our faith? . . . We should be living each day as in the sight of God, becoming messengers of (643) peace to those who need Him. We have only a little time now in which to receive from God light and wisdom for the souls who are in error. If we will exercise faith in God our faith will increase.",
