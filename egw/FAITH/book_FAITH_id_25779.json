    "word": "I see so large a stock of human nature ready to spring into action that sometimes I am disheartened. I fear that the Lord cannot safely work for His people for He will not administer unto sin, or cover these selfish, unconsecrated workers with His robe of righteousness unless there is a deeper consecration, a more earnest faith. How can the Lord work for us? How can the Lord send us means to build churches and schools when the mold of unconsecrated minds will be upon the work? And unless there is decided transformation of character, I dare not expect the Lord to make bare His arm and reveal Himself in our behalf as a number working for God.",
