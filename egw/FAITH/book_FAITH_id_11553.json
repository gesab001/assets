    "word": "If through faith man becomes one with Christ, he can win life everlasting. God loves those who are redeemed through Christ, even as He loves His Son. What a thought! Can God love the sinner as He loves His own Son?--Yes; Christ has said it, and He means just what He says. He will honor all our drafts if we will grasp His promise by living faith, and put our trust in Him. Look to Him, and live. All who obey God are embraced in the prayer which Christ offered to His Father, \"I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them\" (John 17:26). Wonderful truth, too difficult for humanity to comprehend!",
