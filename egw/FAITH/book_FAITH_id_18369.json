    "word": "Brighter and clearer shone the Word of God upon his understanding, giving him a more vivid sense of the errors, corruptions, and hypocrisy of the papacy. His enemies sought to intimidate him, and cause him to renounce his faith, but he boldly stood in defense of the truth. He was ready to die for his faith, if God required; but to yield it\u2014never. God preserved his life. He bade angels attend him, and bring him through the\n246\nstormy conflict, unharmed, and he baffled the rage and purposes of his enemies.\u20144bSG 118, 119.",
