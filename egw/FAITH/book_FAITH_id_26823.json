    "word": "When it is evident that those who are engaged in the Lord's work have made mistakes in some things, Satan is jubilant; he taunts Jesus and the angels of God with the sins he tempts men to commit. He presents these mistakes in all their discouraging features, clothing the erring ones with filthy garments. As the accuser of the brethren he presents these errors and wrong-doings in the worst light possible, and parades them before those who will help him in his work. Then the murmurers and those who are far from God think they have an excuse to be stubborn and sullen. They do not see that hell is triumphing, and that if they had a sense of their responsibility they would like faithful soldiers seek to retrieve the disgrace of defeat, not by leaving the ranks, but by closing up the ranks and pressing to the charge against the enemy, that God might not be dishonored and His cause languish.",
