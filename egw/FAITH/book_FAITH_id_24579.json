    "word": "MR No. 1580 - Admonitions for a Wayward Minister\n\n     (Written September 6, 1886, from Basel, Switzerland, to G. I. Butler. A large portion of the letter is phrased as if it were being addressed directly to J. H Waggoner, the subject of the letter.) \n\n\n     I am troubled in regard to Elder [J. H.] Waggoner. He writes me nothing, and I feel deeply pained on his account. It seems sometimes to me that the Lord is testing us to see whether we will deal faithfully in regard to sin in one of our honored men. The time is close at hand when the General Conference will have to decide the point, whether or not to renew his credentials.",
