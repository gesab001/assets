    "word": "Having engaged in the work, the amazing work of our redemption, Christ determined in council with His Father to spare nothing, however costly, to withhold nothing, however highly it might be estimated, that would rescue the poor sinner. He would give all heaven to this work of salvation, of restoring the moral image of God in man. Can we not enlarge our comprehension, and for Christ's sake see the sinfulness of selfish indulgence, the sinfulness of indifference? The want of interest and faith that has long been cherished has so divorced the soul from God that we have only a faint idea of what constitutes us children of God. To be a child of God is to be one with Christ in God, and to put forth our hands in earnest, self-sacrificing love to strengthen and bless the souls that are perishing in their sins. We are to communicate to them that which God has communicated to us.",
