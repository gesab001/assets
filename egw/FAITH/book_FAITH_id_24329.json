Efforts are made to bring in families to settle where a school is located. How important that these families should be good representatives of our holy Faith. To make it a success, a school needs as teachers and managers cultivated, sanctified, self-sacrificing, brave, compassionate, whole-hearted men and women. And all who shall in any manner be connected with the school need the sanctifying grace of Christ, that the institution may be a bright light amid the moral darkness.",
