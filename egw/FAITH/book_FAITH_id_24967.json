    "word": "Do not labor for those whose characters are cast in an inferior mold, for their influence will not build up; it will not be cast upon the Lord's side, and your work will be almost lost. Men and women who are so weak in mind and principle that it is necessary for someone to be right with them to keep them in the faith, will not reflect light upon others. You want to keep constantly in view that you are to build up the interests of the cause and the work of God, and make the work in that place self-sustaining if possible.",
