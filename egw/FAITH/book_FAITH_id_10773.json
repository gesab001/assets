    "word": "A Publishing Work in Mexico.--I am glad to hear Brother Jones [C. H. JONES, THE MANAGER OF THE PACIFIC PRESS FOR ABOUT FIFTY YEARS.] speaking of Mexico. I am sure that God has a work to do in that field. It may be hard to see that much advancement is being made, but as in faith you sow the seeds of truth, you will reap a harvest. It is in God's order that the work should be started in Mexico. Let this work advance. The Lord desires His people to reach out into new fields. . . . When doors are opened to us, God wants us to enter at once. Be prepared to improve the opportunity.--MS 81, 1901.",
