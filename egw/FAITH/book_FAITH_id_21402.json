    "word": "Those who search the Scriptures and most earnestly seek to understand them, will reveal the sanctification of the Spirit through the belief of the truth, for they take into their very heart the truth, and have that faith that works by love and purifies the soul. All their spiritual sinew and muscle are nourished by the Bread of Life which they eat.--Letter 88, 1900, p. 7. (To the Managers and Teachers in the Avondale School, April 13, 1900.)",
