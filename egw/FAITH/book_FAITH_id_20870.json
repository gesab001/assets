    "word": "One day you will stand in the pulpit and strongly advocate the testimonies which God has sent to his people; in a few days, if you feel like it, you do your best to unsettle faith in them, among those with whom you associate; and then in a day or two you are advocating the testimonies again. Now, my brother, are you anchored anywhere, or are you not more like the waves of the sea, tossed to and fro, unstable, unreliable, moved not by principle, but by emotion? Will not your work be of the same character? Will it not ravel out? Both you and your wife are under the reproof of God. What are you going to do about it? Will you draw nigh to God? Will you set your own \n\n\n                    [76] \n\nhouse in order? Will you unitedly make earnest work for eternity? Or will you throw down the yoke of Jesus, refuse to lift his burdens, and choose to be independent, perverse, willful, uncontrollable? God is faithful to his word. A watcher is beside you in the house of God. A watcher is beside you when you sit in converse with your brethren, and say things that have no foundation in truth. A watcher will write the record of every word and action and that motive that prompted it. There can be no denial of the record, as here you often deny what you have said or done. The watcher will write it all, and he will do the bidding of God in regard to your case.",
