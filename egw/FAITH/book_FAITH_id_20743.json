    "word": "Every time you have fallen under temptation in disregarding the words of his chosen servants, you have become weaker to resist wrong, and have less clearness of discernment to distinguish right and truth from error and darkness. All through Michigan are testimonies borne of your work to condemn you. You have strengthened evils which God condemns. You have encouraged by your practice conformity to the world, which God condemns, and pronounces enmity against God. However admired you may be of the unconsecrated and of worldly men, it is nothing in your favor. Even those who profess to love the truth may flatter you and exalt you; this is still nothing in your favor. You may deceive men, but God reads the heart. You have provoked the displeasure of a just and holy God because of your unchristian spirit toward those of like faith. You have shown no respect for the men whom God is using in his cause, because they could not but condemn your course of harshness and want of brotherly love. The Testimonies of the Spirit of God were unheeded; you knew not the voice that was calling you to repentance. You have shown you were not in harmony with the Spirit of God. You were so far carried away with your assumptions and imaginings that God's words to you have found no response in your hearts. God's holy will, his honor, and his fear have been of slight consideration with you. The Lord has been treated with dissimulation and disrespect. You will urge you have an unblemished character, but God's eye discerns impurities and condemns you as transgressors of his law.",
