    "word": "Entering into communion with our Saviour, we enter the region of peace. . . . We must put faith into constant exercise, and trust in God whatever our feelings may be. . . . We are to be of good cheer, knowing that Christ has overcome the world. We will have tribulation in the world, but peace in Jesus Christ. My brother, turn your eyes from within, and look to Jesus who is your only helper.--Letter 26, 1895.",
