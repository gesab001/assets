    "word": "In the day when God comes to make up His jewels, the works of every soul will stand out clearly and distinctly, not heaped together in an indiscriminate mass. He who bestowed the gift will scrutinize the returns received from every talent. He knows just what men have done, and will reward them accordingly. Happy will be those to whom the words of commendation are spoken, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\"",
