    "word": "Vividly they recall the Saviour\u2019s parable of the husbandmen who refused to render to their lord the fruit of the vineyard, who abused his servants and slew his son. They remember, too, the sentence which they themselves pronounced: The lord of the vineyard \u201cwill miserably destroy those wicked men.\u201d In the sin and punishment of those unfaithful men the priests and elders see their own course and their own just doom. And now there rises a cry of mortal agony. Louder than the shout, \u201cCrucify Him, crucify Him,\u201d which rang through the streets of Jerusalem, swells the awful, despairing wail, \u201cHe is the Son of God! He is the true Messiah!\u201d They seek to flee from the presence of the King of kings. In the deep caverns of the earth, rent asunder by the warring of the elements, they vainly attempt to hide.\u2014GC 643, 644.",
