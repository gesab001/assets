    "word": "I cannot encourage you in laboring as a minister until you are converted. You must first be a Bible Christian yourself, before you can lead others to Christ. Take heed to thyself, and then to the doctrine. I long to see you what you ought to be, and what I know you must be, if you are to receive the benediction, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" You must not only be faithful, but you must be good, self-denying, like Jesus. Now is your sowing-time. By precept and example you may scatter the seeds of truth with an unsparing hand. Make no frantic bounds, but in self-abasement go forward intelligently, steadily, calmly, step by step in the grand work of learning self-control. The talents God has given you are not to be abused, perverted or misapplied. He has given them to you for wise improvement. You are not to cease advancing; you are not to become self-confident, careless, and irreligious, while you are professedly a shepherd of the flock. All heaven has looked with sorrow upon your light and trifling ways. I speak to you plainly, for it is my duty to do so.",
