    "word": "Fear of the Message of Righteousness by Faith.--The teachers of the people have not themselves become acquainted by living experience with the Source of their dependence and their strength. And when the Lord raises up men and sends them with the very message for this time to give to the people--a message which is not a new truth, but the very same that Paul taught, that Christ Himself taught--it is to them a strange doctrine. They begin to caution the people-- who are ready to die because they have not been strengthened with the lifting up of Christ before them--\"Do not be too hasty. Better wait, and not take up with this matter until you know more about it.\" And the ministers preach the same dry theories, when the people need fresh manna.",
