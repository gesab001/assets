    "word": "I beseech you, do not withhold yourselves from God. The moment you surrender yourselves wholly to him, in simple faith, Jesus accepts you, and encircles you in his arms of love. He holds you more firmly than you can grasp him. Come to the light, and triumph in God. Then shall your peace be as a river, and your \u201crighteousness as the waves of the sea.\u201d [Isaiah 48:18.]",
