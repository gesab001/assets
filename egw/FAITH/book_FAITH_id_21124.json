    "word": "At the time of the year Conference at Adams Center, N. Y., Oct. 25, 1868, I was shown that the brethren in Monroe, Wis., were in great perplexity and distress because of the course pursued by H. C. Miller and H. S. \n                                                                           4\nGiddings. Those who have the cause of God at heart can but feel jealous for its prosperity. I was shown that these men were not reliable. They were extremists. They would run the health reform into the ground. They were not pursuing a course which would tend to correct, or reform, those who are intemperate in their diet; but their influence would disgust believers and unbelievers, and drive them further from reform instead of bringing them nearer to it. Our views differ widely from the world in general. They are not popular. The masses will reject any theory, however reasonable it may be, if it lays a restriction upon the appetite. The taste is consulted instead of reason and health. All who leave the common track of custom, and advocate reform, will be opposed, will be accounted mad, insane, radical, let them pursue ever so consistent a course.

These men are doing a work which Satan loves to see go on.",
