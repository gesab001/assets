    "word": "We are living in critical times. Satan's power over the human agents is great to destroy. The Lord in his great mercy is a restorer, the very opposite of Satan. Our brethren who lead out in bearing responsibilities should realize the danger of viewing things solely from their own standpoint, and thinking they have the mind of God and see things as he sees them. The Lord gives us his mind and will to correct every possible mistake in ourselves. Brethren of the same faith should cherish a noble Christian friendship, and sincere love for Jesus and those who love Jesus. The unaffected humility of a mind taught of God will be evidenced by love for the brethren.",
