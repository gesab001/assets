    "word": "I tell you every soul needs a genuine conversion. All your faculties need to be consecrated to God, that you may not encourage the evils prevailing in society, but may counteract them. Many have been cultivating habits that lead directly to earthly and sensual actions; and unless the power of God shall break the snare, souls will be lost in consequence. God has claims upon you that you do not realize; for you have not brought Christ into your lives. Great decision of character will now be necessary on your part, to change this order of things. No weak efforts will accomplish the work. You can not do it for yourselves; you must have the grace of Christ, or you can never overcome. All your plans will prove a failure unless you are actuated by higher motives, and upheld by greater strength, than you can have in and of yourselves. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.\" There will \n\n\n                   -17- \n\nbe no relish for trifling conversation on the part of those who are looking to Jesus for strength, depending upon His righteousness for salvation. By faith they accept Christ as their personal Saviour, and become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.",
