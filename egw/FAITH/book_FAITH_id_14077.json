He would not be induced, even with the promise of wearing the crown of Egypt, to identify himself with the Egyptians, and engage with them in their idolatrous worship. He would not forsake his oppressed brethren, whom he knew were God's chosen people. The king was interested in Moses, and he commanded that he should be instructed in the worship of the Egyptians.
