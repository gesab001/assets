    "word": "Again I inquire, What are you going to do? Will you be wholly on the Lord's side? Will you be a converted man? Remember, I do not say you never have been converted; but will you now have a new consecration? Will you die to self? Will you put away every wrong, and watch, watch for the stealthy approach of the enemy; watch the old habits of sin that will steal back upon you and that need to be shaken off again and again; watch over a careless, unruly tongue; watch your spirit, lest, because you cannot have your own way, you become desperate reckless, profane; watch for opportunities to do good; be ever learning humility and meekness at the feet of Jesus? Oh, when will every child of God learn to unite with Jesus, and not depend upon frail, erring men, and expect to be towed along to heaven by their faith and zeal? Genuine conversion unites the soul in clinging faith to the one helper, Jesus Christ. Make no more half-way efforts, to fall back worse than before; but, oh, make thorough work; begin in your neglected family! Your neglect has not been a lack in your indulgence, but a neglect of their souls. May the Lord make you a priest in your own household.",
