Burden, Loma Linda, Calif. \n\nDear Brother and Sister Burden:- \n     I want to say to you both that I am thankful I was moved to speak as I did concerning the piece of land in front of the Loma Linda Sanitarium. I was urged by the Spirit of God to make the pledge of one thousand dollars; and I did so hoping that others, who were better able to give than I, would follow my example. I dared not leave the meeting without following the conviction I had; and now I feel that I have done my duty, showing my faith by my works. \n\n\n                              -574-",
