    "word": "\"This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\" The world has become a lazar-house of sin, a mass of corruption. It knows not the children of God because it knows Him not. We are not to practice its ways or follow its customs. Continually we are to resist its lax principles. Christ said to His followers, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" It is the duty of physicians and nurses to shine as lights amid the corrupting influences of the world. They are to cherish principles which the world can not tarnish.",
