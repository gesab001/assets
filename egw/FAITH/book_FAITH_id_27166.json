    "word": "But I am almost forgetting my subject. The Lord does not require the General Conference or the Review and Herald, that is now under a burden of debt, to bear the burden of the College debt. That would be doing injustice to the general necessities of the cause in new fields and in foreign lands. Methods must be devised to stop this continued accumulation of debt. The whole cause must not be made to suffer because of these debts. which will never be lifted unless there is an entire change and the work is carried forward on some different basis. Under the present embarrassment, I could not advise that the interest of the money due from the College to the Review and Herald should be remitted. It can not be done as though the Review and Herald were a person dealing with another person, or even as though it were handling its own goods. Those who are bearing responsibilities \n\n\n                                     -149- \n\nin the Review and Herald Office or in any of the interests relating to the General Conference, are dealing with capital which is not their own, which has been brought in by the people; and they have no right to handle these goods as they have been doing. The means should not be grasped as it has been by selfish men, who have not helped to build up the work, but whose selfish hearts, knowing little of sacrifice, have grasped all the wages they could obtain. God has been dishonored by those men who have worked as worldlings work. The means which is in the hands of responsible men should be carefully and faithfully handled.",
