    "word": "When the Lord first gave me messages to deliver to his people, it was hard for me to declare them. And I often softened them down, and made them as mild as possible for fear of grieving them. It was a great trial to declare the messages as the Lord gave them to me. I did not realize that I was so unfaithful, and did not see the danger and sin of such a course, until I was taken in vision into the presence of Jesus. He looked upon me with a frown, and turned his face from me. It is not possible to describe the terror and agony I then felt. I fell upon my face before him, but had no power to utter a word. O, how I longed to be covered and hid from that dreadful frown. Then could I realize, in some degree what the feelings of the lost will be, when they cry, \u2018Mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.\u201d",
