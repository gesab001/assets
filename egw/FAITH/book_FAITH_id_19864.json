    "word": "Neglected Opportunities. \n\n     We see large churches gathered in different localities. Their members have a knowledge of the truth; but they are content to hear and partake of the word of life themselves, and do not seek to impart light to those who are without. Because of these neglected opportunities, this abuse of privileges, they themselves are not growing \"in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\" Thus the members of our churches are weak in faith, deficient in knowledge, and children in experience. They are not rooted and grounded in the truth. If they remain thus, the many delusions of the last days will surely deceive them; for they will have no spiritual eyesight to discern truth from error.",
