    "word": "This is the work of God. We take hold of it in the name of the Lord. He will give us strength. By faith we claim His power to help us. We feel that we cannot rest until we see the work moving forward more surely, earnestly, and upon a more elevated, broader platform than it has hitherto done on this coast. We have our preferences where we would love to be and love to work, but these must not come in to control us. God has a perfect right to us, to ours, a right to say go or come, do this or that, and we as His agents must do His will freely, not our own will. Our means, our children, ourselves are all His. He is our Creator. If we can only honor God, how grateful we should be. We must save souls to Jesus Christ. If God blesses and honors our plans, we shall see souls saved as the result.--Letter 19b, 1874, pp. 3-5. (To Edson and Emma White, April 27, 1874.)",
