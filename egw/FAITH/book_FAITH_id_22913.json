    "word": "Who shall comfort God's servants when they are grieved and disappointed? Will their faith steer clear? Will they be Christlike amid the rocks without shipwreck? God does not take pleasure in disappointing our hopes and bowing our souls down with anguish. God will fulfill the desire of them that are faithful to do His bidding. But we must not prescribe to Him time, place, or manner, when this must be done. He will not suffer His servants to spend their strength for naught. There may be an appearance that they are frustrated for a time. It is for their good, for their success is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth.",
