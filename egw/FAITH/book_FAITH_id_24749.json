    "word": "A Letter to Mrs. White's Children, December 6, 1890 \n\n     Dear Children, Willie, Edson, and Emma: I have just come from the hall where the little company assemble to worship on the Sabbath. There were about 80 present. I spoke from John 14:15--\"If ye love me, keep my commandments.\" I had much freedom in speaking, then we had a social meeting and 38 testimonies were borne. The older members did not take the time, but gave opportunity for those who had more recently come to the faith. . . .",
