    "word": "The Lord has blessed Battle Creek again and again by pouring out his Holy Spirit upon the Church and the workers, but how few have cherished its influence? How few have expended money as he has directed? Means has been used in educating those who know the truth, while fields have been neglected where souls are wholly unenlightened. Had ministers gone out, and used the gifts God has given them in carrying the burden of the work in preaching to souls ready to perish, they would have had far greater knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ than they have attained by seeking the education of the schools. They should have done their very best in the strength of God, as did the disciples after the Holy Spirit came upon them, when they went everywhere preaching the word, and when the power of God attended their message. Has God given us a work to do? Has God bidden us go amid opposing influences and convert men from error to truth? Why have not the men and women who have so frequently gathered to the large assemblies in Battle Creek not put into practice the truth which they have heard? If they had imparted the light which they had received, what a transformation of character we would have seen. For every grace imparted God would have given grace. The work that has been done for them has not been prized as it should have been, or they would have gone forth \n                                                                           1420\ninto the darkened places of the earth, and shed abroad the light which God has shed upon them. They would have given to the world the message of the righteousness of Christ through, faith and their own light would have become clearer and clearer, for God would have worked with them. Many have gone into the grave in error, simply because those who professed the truth have failed to communicate the precious knowledge they have received. If the light that has shone in super abundance in Battle Creek had been diffused, we would have seen many raised up to become laborers together with God.",
