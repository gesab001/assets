An Open Door.--The true Witness declares: \"Behold, I have set before thee \n                                                                           961\nan open door.\" Let us thank God with heart and soul and voice; and let us learn to approach unto Him as through an open door, believing that we may come freely with our petitions, and that He will hear and answer. It is by a living faith in His power to help, that we shall receive strength to fight the battles of the Lord with the confident assurance of victory (RH July 9, 1908).",
