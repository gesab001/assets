    "word": "God gives no man a message that it will be five years or ten years or twenty years before this earth's history shall close. He would not give any living being an excuse for delaying the preparation for His appearing. He would have no one say, as did the unfaithful servant, \"My lord delayeth his coming,\" for this leads to reckless neglect of the opportunities and privileges given to prepare us for that great day.--RH Nov. 27, 1900.",
