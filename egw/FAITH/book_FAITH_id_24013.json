    "word": "The end of all things is at hand. Are we ready to meet Christ when He shall appear? Will He say to us, \"Come, ye blessed of My Father; enter into the city\"? When we see the great reward that is in store for the faithful, how our hearts should reach out after others, that they may receive the light. You know not how many hearts are really thirsting for the waters of life, but here is the Bible to open before them. Will you do it? Will you act like men and women that expect the Lord to come? Will you have living faith, and pray as never before? Will you wrestle with God as Jacob wrestled with Him--\"I will not let Thee go except Thou bless me\"? And when His blessing rests upon you, you will be anxious to have others receive it.",
