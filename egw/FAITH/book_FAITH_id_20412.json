Many refuse to receive the light which the providence of God sends, them, and, as an excuse for so doing, quote the words of Peter to Cornelius and his friends: \"But in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.\" They maintain that it is of no consequence what men believe, so long as their works are good. Such ones are wrong; faith must unite with their works. They should advance with the light that is given them. If God brings them in connection with his servants who have received new truth, substantiated by the Word of God, they should accept it with joy. Truth is onward. Truth is upward. On the other hand, those who claim that their faith alone will save them, are trusting to a rope of sand; for faith is strengthened and made perfect by works only.",
