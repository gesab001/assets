    "word": "Yesterday afternoon I talked to the people from Luke 12. This chapter is a lesson of great importance for all the sons and daughters of God. I told them at the close of my talk that we desired to build a church, and that we would accept all the help that was freely given. We should have to move out by faith. We did not design to erect a cathedral, but a plain building that we would call a tabernacle; one that would be in harmony with our faith. We could not conscientiously spend any of the Lord's money in needless adornment. We would have a neat structure. Skillful hands could make it very tasteful and appropriate. I told them that the building at Cooranbong was a commendable house of worship--neat, thoroughly well built and, in harmony with our faith, dedicated to God free from debt. The interest paid on a debt left on any house of worship is a great loss. We propose that this house shall be as a tabernacle for us. We are all pilgrims and strangers; our citizenship is above.",
