    "word": "In Jesus we have an enduring, unchanging Friend; and though all worldly prospects fail, and every earthly friend prove unfaithful and treacherous, yet He is faithful still. His servants are as dear to Him as the apple of the eye. In trial, in want, in perplexity and distress, we are not alone; at every step, in tones of assurance, He bids you, \"Follow Me, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.\" But this blessed assurance is given only on condition of your obedience and faithfulness to Him. \n\n\n                                    -278-",
