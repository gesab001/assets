    "word": "I am pleased that there are those who desire to be medical missionaries. But all cannot be medical missionaries in the whole sense in which it is now carried. There are those who must be qualified for the work to be done now in bringing the last message of warning to all cities and in all towns in all parts of our world. They cannot engage themselves for a stated number of years to learn the work of a medical missionary. While some feel that this is their work and choose to put themselves under training for this work, others feel that they must train themselves to be faithful ministers, skillful shepherds of the flock of God, that they may bring from the storehouse meat in due season for sheep and lambs.",
