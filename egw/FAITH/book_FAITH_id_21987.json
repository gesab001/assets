    "word": "Now, we want to have an intelligent knowledge of this thing. Then we want to take hold of the righteousness of Jesus Christ by living faith, and know that we have not any. We may work to the very best of our ability, and we cannot make a single virtue in ourselves; it is the righteousness of Christ alone that can do it. Then as we are clothed with the righteousness of Christ we have a power and a strength that is imparted unto us, and we will not want to sin; we cannot do it with the righteousness of Christ, with ourselves in a position where we shall have Christ working with us and by us. We may make mistakes; we may make errors; but we shall hate these sins--the sins that caused the suffering of the Son of God in our behalf because we were transgressors of the law of God.--Ms 9, 1890, pp. 2, 3.
