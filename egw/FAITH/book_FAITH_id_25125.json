    "word": "During the past few years there have been some experiences in \n\n\n              -306- \n\nwhich men have set themselves to watch certain workers, lest they solicit means for the upbuilding in their part of the field of the work that the Lord has instructed us should be built up. The work in the southern field has been hindered, and means which should have gone to advance the work there has been held back because of a spirit of fear lest too much means be diverted to this channel. We ought not to have had this experience of keeping back men from the important work of opening blind eyes to the light of present truth. It was inconsistent with the faith we profess to hold that faithful men, doing a work greatly needed, should be forbidden to receive donations for the assistance of their work.",
