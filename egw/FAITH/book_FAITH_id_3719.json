    "word": "The Lord will not judge you by the amount of success manifested in your efforts. I was bidden to tell you that your faith must be kept revived and firm, and constantly increasing. When you see that those who have ears will not hear, and, that those who are  intelligent will not understand, after you have done your best, pass on to regions beyond and leave the result with God. But let not your faith fail.--Letter 8, 1895.",
