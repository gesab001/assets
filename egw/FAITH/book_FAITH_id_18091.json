    "word": "To be living Christians, we must have a vital connection with Christ. . . . When the affections are sanctified, our obligations to God are made primary, everything else secondary. To have a steady and ever-growing love for God, and a clear perception of His character and attributes, we must keep the eye of faith fixed constantly on Him. Christ is the life of the soul. We must be in Him and He in us, else we are sapless branches.\u2014Review and Herald, May 30, 1882.",
