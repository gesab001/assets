    "word": "If the enemy makes us believe his presentations and assertions, we begin to behold another character. We will entertain his suggestions, and put him in the place of God. God is the one that we are to believe. We are to live on every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Here the enemy brought in a lie, and man believed it. What we are to do is to purify our souls by obeying the truth, and we are to educate ourselves in a certain faith. What is that certain faith? It is the faith that works by love to purify the soul from every idol that we have enthroned there. We cannot afford to entertain an error because it has been handed down from generation to generation till it has come down to our time. What we want is truth, and we want it on every point.",
