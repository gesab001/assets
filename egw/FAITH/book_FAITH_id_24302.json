    "word": "There have been those who have felt it their duty to criticize and question and find fault with things they know nothing about experimentally in regard to health reform. They should stand shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart with those who are working in right lines. There must be men who shall proclaim the truth in the churches, giving to the people the reasons of our faith. The light in regard to health reform is to be given to the world and to our churches. Our people in Michigan should be deeply stirred, for many of them are behind in this work.",
