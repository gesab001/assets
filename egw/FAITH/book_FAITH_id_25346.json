    "word": "I had a profitable interview with Sister Rankin, matron of the college. Attended to some business in the city of Battle Creek. Was called from my visiting to have an interview with a young brother in the faith named Kellogg. He is in perplexity as to whether he shall study to be a doctor or a minister. I advised him to pray in faith that God would give him light, for His promise is sure: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally . . . and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.\" James 1:5, 6.",
