    "word": "God demands of us perfect obedience to His law--the expression of His character. \"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the law.\" This law is the echo of God's voice, saying to us, \"Holier, yes, holier still.\" Desire the fullness of the grace of Christ; yea, long--hunger and thirst--after righteousness. The promise is, \"Ye shall be filled.\" Let your heart be filled with an intense longing for this righteousness, the work of which God's Word declares is peace, and its effect, quietness and assurance forever.",
