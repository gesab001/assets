    "word": "\"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" Now faith walks the narrow plank, and walks till it comes to the end, then steps right off onto nothing, as it were. Yet it is everything. It is a mighty upholder. You walk the plank of faith and you cannot see another step to go. You need not consult how you feel. Feeling has nothing to do with it. Do I believe in God, that He is my God, and that His promises will be verified to me? Then I go right about my work. I never look or examine whether I have feeling or have no feeling. I know what my duty is from the expressed will of God, and it is for me to do it and do it intelligently.",
