    "word": "We may work intelligently and be laborers for God, and in [our] doing this work He will give us strength. If we sow we shall also reap, and an abundant harvest will be gathered. In order to work the works of God we must have the help of Christ. We should not be satisfied by working out our own salvation, but we must work for the salvation of others. There are hundreds around us that need our personal efforts. It will be our rejoicing to see souls saved through our instrumentality. The work done here for God will show through out all ages, so all should work while there is an opportunity. There is a work for all to do, and if we will let the refining influence of the Spirit of God sanctify us through the Word we can be fitted to reach others, and the glory that awaits the faithful is beyond our comprehension. \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.\" 1 Corinthians 2:9.",
