    "word": "The work is progressive \u2014 action and reaction. Love and devotion to God will give activity to benevolence, and benevolence will increase faith and spirituality. Oh how much we need heavenly wisdom! Well, is it not promised us? \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.\u201d Oh what an assurance is this! How full and broad! Let us take the promise just as it reads. The Lord wants us to come unto Him with full \n44\nassurance of faith, believing His word, that He will do just as He said He would.",
