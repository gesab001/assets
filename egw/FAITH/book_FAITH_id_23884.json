    "word": "My brethren and sisters, the end is nearer than when we first believed. I would say to the believers who have met at Berkeley, You are a mixed company. I might mention the names of some whom I have been shown stand in a wrong relation to God and His work, but this would not be best at this time. If things continue as they have been, I shall have to do this. There are others who will understand when the converting power of truth shall take hold of them. Those who have seen and heard so much to confirm their faith, and yet have not manifested genuine repentance, need to experience a true conversion. If their repentance is not thorough, they will work out the same plans in the future that they have carried in the past. There is a decided work to be done in the Berkeley church. If they will receive the messages of God, and will humble their hearts and be converted, then the union of the two companies will result in lasting good.",
