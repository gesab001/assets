    "word": "I was shown that the love of money is a snare to you. Money, independent of the opportunity it furnishes for doing good, blessing the needy, and advancing the cause of God, is really of but little value. The little you possess is a snare to you. Unless you use your talents of means as a wise and faithful steward in the service of your Master it will yield you little else but misery.",
