    "word": "The Literature We Leave in the Homes Will Bear Fruit.--\"Your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,\" you will be prepared to walk from house to house carrying the truth to the people. Sometimes you will find it very trying to do work of this kind; but if you go forth in faith, the Lord will go before you, and His light will shine upon your pathway. \n                                                                           101\nAs you enter the homes of your neighbors to sell or to give away our literature, and in humility to teach them the truth, you will be accompanied by the light of heaven.--Review and Herald, Nov. 11, 1902.",
