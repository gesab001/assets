    "word": "I hope the words I have spoken will not go out of your hearts, like water out of a leaky vessel. I have not spoken to you my own words. I promised the Lord that if I were permitted to meet with you again I would not withhold the truth, although it might not please you all. I know there are some that will be benefited, and in the day of reward the faithful overseer, the faithful shepherd of the flock, will receive a crown of glory. I entreat you, for Christ's sake, do not let the spirit of the enemy take possession of you, and the work be marred in consequence in your hands.",
