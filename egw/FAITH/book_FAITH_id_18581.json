    "word": "\"We are labourers together with God\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). Christ engaged in the great work for which He lived and died. We are to be instant in season and out of season. And why? \"For ye are bought with a price,\" and have enlisted under the banner of Prince Emmanuel. We are enlisted for labor, \"not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life\" (John 6:27). We are to work out our own salvation with fear and with trembling. We are not our own. We are bought with a price, to glorify God with our bodies and spirits, which are His. A work is to be done. There is a faithful work to do in His vineyard. And to every man is given his work. If we are privileged with the bread of life, we must work in the Lord's vineyard. A charge comes to us to deny ourselves and take up the cross and follow Christ. We are to run the race set before us with persevering earnestness. This oft requires energetic movements. We cannot be idlers. We are urged, \"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.\" . . .",
