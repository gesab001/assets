    "word": "In the prophecy of Daniel it was recorded of Christ that He shall \"make reconciliation for iniquity, and . . . bring in everlasting righteousness\" (Daniel 9:24). Every soul may say: \"By His perfect obedience He has satisfied the claims of the law, and my only hope is found in looking to Him as my substitute and surety, who obeyed the law perfectly for me. By faith in His merits I am free from the condemnation of the law. He clothes me with His righteousness, which answers all the demands of the law. I am complete in Him who brings in everlasting righteousness. He presents me to God in the spotless garment of which no thread was woven by any human agent. All is of Christ, and all the glory, honor, and majesty are to be given to the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.\"",
