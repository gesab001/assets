    "word": "Faith Has Precious Lessons for Children.--For the child . . . who is quick to resent injuries, faith has precious lessons. The disposition to resist evil or to avenge wrong is often prompted by a keen sense of justice and an active, energetic spirit. Let such a child be taught that God is the eternal guardian of right. He has a tender care for the beings whom He has so loved as to give His Dearest Beloved to save. He will deal with every wrongdoer.--Ed 256, 257 (1903).",
