    "word": "Without giving \"all diligence\" to make step after step upward to God above the ladder, there is no gaining ground in peace and grace and the work of holiness. \"Strive,\" said Jesus, \"to enter in at the strait gate\" (Luke 13:24). The way of the believer is marked out by God above the ladder. All his endeavors will be in vain if he has not virtue of character, a practical knowledge of Christ through obedience to all His requirements. Those who have faith must be careful to show their faith by their works.",
