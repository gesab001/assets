    "word": "You have a serious, solemn work to do to prepare the way of the Lord. You need the heavenly unction, and you may have it. \"Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father \n\n\n                          - 15 - \n\nin my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.\" Who can be trifling, who can engage in frivolous, common talk, while by faith he sees the Lamb that was slain pleading before the Father as the intercessor of the church upon earth. By faith let us look upon the rainbow round about the throne, the cloud of sins confessed behind it. The rainbow of promise is an assurance to every humble, contrite, believing soul, that his life is one with Christ, and that Christ is one with God. The wrath of God will not fall upon one soul that seeks refuge in him. God himself has declared, \"When I see the blood, I will pass over you.\" \"The bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant.\" It is Christ that loves the world with a love that is infinite. He gave his precious life. He was the only begotten of the Father. He is risen again from the dead, and is at the right hand of God, making intercession for us. That same Jesus, with his humanity glorified, with no cessation of his love, is our Saviour. He has enjoined upon us to love one another as he has loved us. Will we then cultivate this love? Shall we be like Jesus? \n                                      Ellen G. White. \n\n\n     Petoskey, Mich., Aug. 20, 1890.",
