Do not depend on the faith of others, but lay yourself, soul, body, and spirit, upon the altar of God for repairs and restoration. We present your case to God in our family and private prayers. It is your privilege to seek the Lord with earnest faith, and to believe that He would have you healed.--Letter 100, 1898, p 8.
