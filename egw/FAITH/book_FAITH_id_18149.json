    "word": "Human beings professing to be ministers of God raise their voices against the investigation of prophecy, and tell the people that the prophecies, especially of Daniel and John, are obscure, and that we cannot understand them. Yet some of these very ones eagerly receive the suppositions of geologists, which dispute the Mosaic record. But if God\u2019s revealed will is so difficult to be understood, certainly people should not rest their faith upon mere suppositions in regard to that which He has not revealed. God\u2019s ways are not as our ways, neither are His thoughts as our thoughts. . . .Humans, with their vain reasoning, make a wrong use of these things which God designed should lead them to exalt Him. They fall into the same error as did the people before the Flood\u2014those things which God gave them as a benefit, they turned into a curse, by making a wrong use of them.\u2014Signs of the Times, March 20, 1879.",
