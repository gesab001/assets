    "word": "John saw the temple of God opened in heaven, and in that temple he saw the ark of His testimony. Says John, \"Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus\" (Revelation 14:12). The path of true obedience is found in the commandments of God. But Satan is going about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. He does not always appear like a lion; he has the power of clothing himself like a lamb, and he has a soft and a tender voice. And how shall we meet him? shall we let him come in and take the control of our hearts? shall we let him have the charge of our minds and lives? We cannot afford it.",
