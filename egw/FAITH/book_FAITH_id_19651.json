    "word": "The death of Christ was accomplished to make us genuine Christians through faith in Him. We carry a message of sacred truth, and through the righteousness of Christ we are to become one in Him, separate from the world, distinguished from it by the features of our faith that makes us heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ. We are Christ's witnesses. By our baptismal vow we are under solemn pledge to God to witness for Him. Through the merits of Christ we are to let our light shine forth to the world, that they, by seeing our good works, may glorify our Father which is in heaven.",
