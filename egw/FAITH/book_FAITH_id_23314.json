    "word": "God has given me a special understanding of your past life, for the purpose of placing upon me the burden of having a care for you, that I might help you to be faithful. I was told that I must not let you go. I was instructed that other men who have committed errors would sit in judgment on your case; that those who have done wrong themselves and whose course God condemns, would judge you as severely as possible, and discourage you--as if this condemnation revealed that they were perfect, and zealous for truth and righteousness. The Lord instructed me to act the part of a faithful, judicious mother toward you, because others do not understand you. Even as I write, my eyes are filled with tears. I have tried to give you the words spoken by the One through whom I have often received instruction. I have nothing to add or to take away from this message. If you will act upon these words, they will be to your soul a savor of life unto life.--Letter 163, 1902. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. February 7, 1985 Entire Letter",
