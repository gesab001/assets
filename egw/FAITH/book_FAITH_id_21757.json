    "word": "MR No. 238 - Faith Needed to Stand the Trials\n\n     We received your kind and sweet letter in due time. James was in New York when it came and my health was very poor at that time or I should have written you before his return. He came home last Tuesday, had a good time in western New York feeding the hungry sheep. We have been in a very tried state of late while we see the wrongs in Connecticut. My soul has carried the burden of distress for two weeks past.",
