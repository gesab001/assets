    "word": "The true follower of Christ should not be dismayed at receiving reproach from this class. Said the beloved apostle, \"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.\" 1 John 3:13. And our Saviour reminds His disciples, \"If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.\" John 15:18. Those who are faithful to God will not be harmed by reproach or opposition. Nay, rather, virtues will thus be developed that will not flourish in the sunshine of prosperity. Faith, patience, meekness, and love will bud and blossom amid clouds and darkness.",
