    "word": "Energy and Courage\n     Among the people who profess present truth there is not a missionary spirit corresponding to our faith. The ring of the true gold in character is wanting. Christian life is more than many take it to be. It does not \n20\nconsist in mere gentleness, patience, meekness, and kindliness. These graces are essential; but there is need of courage, decision, energy, and perseverance also. Many who engage in the work of canvassing are weak, nerveless, spiritless, easily discouraged. They lack push. They have not those positive traits of character that give men power to do something,\u2014the spirit and energy that kindle enthusiasm. The canvasser is engaged in an honorable business, and he should not act as if he were ashamed of it. If he desires that success shall attend his efforts, he must be courageous and hopeful.",
