    "word": "The Tithe \n\n     The men connected with the institutions of God's appointment should be careful to acknowledge Him in all their ways. To Him they owe their intellect and all their capabilities, and they are to acknowledge this. As did Abraham, they are to pay a faithful tithe of all they possess and all they receive. A faithful tithe is the Lord's portion. To withhold it is to rob God. Every one should freely, willingly, gladly, bring tithes and offerings into the storehouse of the Lord. In so doing he will receive a blessing. There is no safety in withholding from God His own portion.--MS. 162, 1897.",
