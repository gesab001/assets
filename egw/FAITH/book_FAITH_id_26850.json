    "word": "Let us all strive to make of Loma Linda just what God means it should be. This is the principal thing I have to say - make this place what God would have you make of it. Every one of you is under bounden duty to God to labor in harmony, and to press the battle to the gate. If unbelievers come in and talk their doubts and fears, remember that Satan is not dead. He has agencies through whom he works; but shall we become discouraged because of this? Oh, no! Christ, our Saviour, lives and reigns. Let us not look on the dark side . As soon as we yield to the temptation to do this, we shall have plenty of company. But there is nothing to be gained by looking on the dark side. What we want is courage in the Lord; and we want to follow on to know the Lord, that we may know that His going forth is prepared as the morning. This is not going back into darkness. You know how the morning is prepared. If you follow on to know the Lord every day, you will increase in brightness, in courage, in faith, and the Lord Jesus will be to you a present help in every time of need. \n\n\n                            Ellen G. White \n\n176.",
