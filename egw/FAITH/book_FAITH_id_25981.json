    "word": "We see by faith the stamp of divinity upon the human children of God. We see those who have noble intellectual and moral powers. The Lord has need of them. \"Go work today in my vineyard.\" The Lord wants them to know themselves and to know God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent, and to find out the character of his fellow men, that they may do them good. The most are poor in this world's goods and some are having a struggle with poverty. We think of Jesus the Creator of all the worlds, and how He came into the world as a poor man. He had not where to lay His head. So poverty is no disgrace. Sin is a disgrace.",
