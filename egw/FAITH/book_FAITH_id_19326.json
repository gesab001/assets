W., Australia, \n                                     Sept. 1, 1895. \n\nDear Brother and Sister -----:-- \n     Brother ----- laid out before me the plans for meetings to be held for weeks in different places among those who know the truth. Doubtless some who have newly come to the faith would be benefited, but I know you are not on the right track. Some of those called together will no doubt have their faith strengthened and confirmed; but this work is not bearing the message of warning to those who are still in darkness and error, who know not the truth. Time is passing, the perils of the last days are upon us, and how many will say to us in the last great day, when every man shall receive according to his works, Why have you not warned us? You have not told us those things that we should have known.",
