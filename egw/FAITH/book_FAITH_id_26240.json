    "word": "\"You are men of varied talents, and you are right on the ground. The Lord will be your instructor in all matters if you will seek His counsel in faith. If He gives you light in the matter, then you can move with assurance. Now is the time for you to ask of the Lord wisdom, and submit your plans to Him. It is an excellent opportunity for you to receive an individual experience. Plan wisely; move guardedly; and the Lord will certainly be your helper.",
