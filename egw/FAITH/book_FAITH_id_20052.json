    "word": "I was shown that the physicians at our Institute should be men and women of faith and spirituality. They should make God their trust. There are many who come to the Institute who have, by their own sinful indulgence, brought upon themselves disease of almost every type. This class do not deserve the sympathy that they frequently require. And it is painful to the physicians to devote time and strength over this class, who are debased physically, mentally, and morally. But there is a class \n                                                                           37\nwho have, through ignorance, lived in violation of nature's laws. They have worked intemperately, and have eaten intemperately, because it was the custom so to do. Some have suffered many things, from many physicians; but have not been made better, but decidedly worse. At length they are torn from business, from society, and their families, and as their last resort, come to the Health Institute with some faint hope that they may find relief. This class need sympathy. They should be treated with the greatest tenderness, and care should be taken to make clear to their understanding the laws of their being, that they may govern themselves, and avoid violating them, and thereby avoid suffering and disease, which is the penalty of nature's violated law.",
