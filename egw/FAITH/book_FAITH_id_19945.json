    "word": "At our camp-meetings, when you have a congregation before you for only two weeks, do not defer the presentation of the Sabbath question until every thing else is presented, supposing that you thus pave the way for it. Lift up the standard, the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. Make this the important theme. Then by your strong arguments make it of still greater force. Dwell more on the Revelation. Read, explain, and enforce its teaching. \"Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein; for the time is at hand.\"  Revelation 1:3.",
