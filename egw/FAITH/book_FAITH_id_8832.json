    "word": "The whole mind and soul should become imbued with the truth, that you may be a living representation of Christ. . . . God would have you filled with His Holy Spirit, endowed with power from on high. Labor not to become great men; but labor rather to become good and perfect men, showing forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. God calls for Calebs and Joshuas, fearless, singlehearted men, who will work with faith and courage.",
