    "word": "It is a beautiful morning. The Lord is good, and I praise His holy name. I greatly desire a clear, distinct idea of the subject of righteousness by faith in Christ. We have thought and talked on this subject far less than we should have; therefore we have dwelt in the shadow of darkness--hopeless, faithless, without power to resist the tempter. We need clearer spiritual eyesight, that like Moses we may be able to endure the seeing of Him who is invisible. There is a great work to be done in Australia, a great work to be done in the Melbourne church. In this city we should have one hundred missionaries at work, but instead there are only a few Bible workers. What does this mean? My cry is, \"O God, wake up the people, and make them laborers together with Thee. Breathe into those who know the message for this time the true missionary spirit.\"--Ms. 20, 1892, pp. 40, 44. (Diary entry written in Preston, Victoria, Australia, August 1 and 9, 1892; August 9 part also in Ms 35, 1892.)",
