    "word": "Do not regard as most essential the theoretical part of your education. Medical students will have to follow the prescribed studies. They will listen to many theories that are contrary to truth. The Lord would have our medical students connect closely with those who believe and teach the truth. And as helpers with them, they can learn how to treat the sick, and how to become faithful ministers to the sick. There are many ways by which the Lord would have us connect with those who honor and teach his Word, and he will give us through this connection a most valuable education.",
