    "word": "In your work you will meet with those who are fighting against appetite. Speak words that will strengthen and encourage them. Do not let Satan quench the last spark of hope in their hearts. Of the erring, trembling one, struggling against evil, Christ says, \"Let him come unto Me,\" and as he comes, He places His hands underneath him and lifts him up. The work that He did, you, as His evangelists, can do as you go from place to place. Labor on in faith, expecting that souls will be won to Him who gave His life that men and women might stand on God's side. Draw with God to win the drunkard and the tobacco devotee from the habits that debase them till they are below the level of the beasts that perish. \n                                                                           10",
