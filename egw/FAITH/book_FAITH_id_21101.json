    "word": "Here is the duty of God's servants made plain. They cannot be excused from the faithful discharge of their duty to reprove sins and wrongs in the people of God, although it may be a disagreeable task, and may not be received by the one who is at fault. But in most cases the one reproved would accept the warning and would heed reproof were it not that others stand in their way. They come in as sympathizers, and pity the one reproved, and feel that they must stand in his defense. They do not see that God is displeased with the wrong-doer because his cause has been wounded, and his name reproached. Souls have been turned aside from the truth and made shipwreck of faith as the result of the wrong course pursued by the one in fault; but the servant of God whose discernment is clouded, and his judgment swayed by wrong influences, would as soon take his position with the offender whose influence has done much harm, as with the reprover of wrong and of sin, and in thus doing he virtually says to the sinner, Do not be troubled, do not be cast down; you are about right after all. These say to the sinner, \"It shall be well with thee.\"",
