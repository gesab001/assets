    "word": "It is an easy matter to find objections to plans, and see difficulty in the way of carrying them out. Far better venture in some risks than stubbornly do nothing but question. The unfaithful spies had no trouble in seeing and presenting obstacles that appeared insurmountable in the way of the advancement of the people of God. Satan is ever ready to suggest unbelief, to point out objections over which to quibble, to reveal difficulties that seemingly cannot be overcome. But those who are on the Lord's side, on the faith side, must not allow the voice of men to turn them aside from the voice of God. They must press on with more determined effort. They must press forward in the way of the Lord with as much earnestness as the doubters manifest in seeking to hinder them. Those who are so eager to find fault know not what spirit they are of. They think they love the truth, and the cause of God; but their own ideas, their own ways are dearer to them than the advancement of the Lord's work if it does not go according to their own mind. It is like plucking out a right eye or taking off a right arm, to give up their own way or will, and receive and act upon the counsel or direction of others.",
