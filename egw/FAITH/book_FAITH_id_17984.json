    "word": "Christ's commission is to be received and acted upon. We are to go forth in faith, with earnest prayer for the presence of One who has said, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" (Matthew 28:20). With the promise of such companionship, we are guilty of great unbelief and disobedience if we refuse to take up the cross of self-denial and self-sacrifice. . . . As we communicate the light that has found entrance to our souls, the Holy Spirit gives increased light, and our hearts are filled with the precious joy of the Lord. . . .",
