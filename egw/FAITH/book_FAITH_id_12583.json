    "word": "Christ died to make an atoning sacrifice for our sins. At the father's right hand He is interceding for us as our High Priest. By the sacrifice of His life He purchased redemption for us. His atonement is effectual for every one who will humble himself, and receive Christ as his example in all things. If the Saviour had not given His life as a propitiation for our sins, the whole human family would have perished. They would have had no right to heaven. It is through His intercession that we, through faith, \n\n(478) \n\nrepentance, and conversion, are enabled to become partakers of the divine nature, and thus escape the corruption that is in the world through lust.--Manuscript 29, 1906.",
