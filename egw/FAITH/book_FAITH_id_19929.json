    "word": "Anciently the Lord instructed his people to assemble three times a year for his worship. To these holy convocations the children of Israel came, bringing to the house of God their tithes, their sin-offerings, and their offerings of gratitude. \n\n\n                     - 10 - \n\nThey met to recount God's mercies, to make known his wonderful works, and to offer praise and thanksgiving to his name. And they were to unite in the sacrificial service which pointed to Christ as the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. Thus they were to be preserved from the corrupting power of worldliness and idolatry. Faith and love and gratitude were to be kept alive in their hearts, and through their association together in this sacred service they were to be bound closer to God and to one another.",
