    "word": "Our faith cannot be vested in any man. We need Christ's righteousness. We need Jesus ever by our side. He is our Rock. It is by his might that we conquer, and by his righteousness that we are saved. When I see men exalted and praised, extolled as almost infallible, I know that there must come a terrible shaking. When God's lamp of life shines into the heart with clear and steady ray, darkness will instantly be dispelled. Every idol will be dethroned, and the peace of God which passeth all understanding will reign in the heart. Truth, precious truth, will be seen, appreciated, and obeyed. The standard will be elevated, and many will rally round it. \n\n\n                                            (Signed) \n\n(M.H. May 9, '97)                                Ellen G.
