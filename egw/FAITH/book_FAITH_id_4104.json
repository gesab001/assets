    "word": "The so-called faith that does not work by love and purify the soul will not justify any man. \"Ye see,\" says the apostle, \"how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.\" James 2:24. Abraham believed God. How do we know that he believed? His works testified to the character of his faith, and his faith was accounted to him for righteousness. We need the faith of Abraham in our day, to lighten the darkness that gathers around us, shutting out the sweet sunlight of God's love, and dwarfing spiritual growth. Our faith should be prolific of good works; for faith without works is dead. \n                                                                           116",
