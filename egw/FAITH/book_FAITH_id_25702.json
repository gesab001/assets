    "word": "Pine Creek, Michigan, January 10, 1891 \n\n     We went with our own carriage drawn by faithful Jessie to Pine Creek, fourteen miles, to speak to the people. It was quite cold but the roads were good and we were only two hours and ten minutes going to the place. Willie White was somewhat chilled. We stopped at the home of Brother Vermer,-- who with his wife has recently embraced the truth--and laid off our heavy wraps, and then went to the schoolhouse.",
