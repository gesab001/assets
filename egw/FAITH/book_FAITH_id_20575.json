    "word": "Unity should be recognized as the element of preservation in the church. Those who are united in church capacity have entered into a solemn covenant with God to obey His word, and to unite in an effort to strengthen the faith of one another. They are to be one in Him, even though they are scattered the world over. This is God's purpose concerning them, and the heart of the Saviour is set upon His followers' fulfilling this purpose. But God cannot make them one with Christ unless they are willing to give up their way for His way.",
