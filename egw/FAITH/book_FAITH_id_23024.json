    "word": "Experimental religion must be urged upon those who embrace the theory of the truth. Ministers must not neglect to keep their own souls in the love of the truth and of God, and then impress upon the people the necessity of an individual consecration, a personal conversion, and a living experience to be obtained for themselves; or the profession of faith is of no value. It is, indeed, worse than if they had never embraced the truth, for they are as salt without the savor.",
