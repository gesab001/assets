    "word": "This is true of many of the youth of today. In order to compass their ends, they will work in secrecy, acting a part that is not frank and open and according to the Bible standard. By this course they educate themselves to be untrue to those who love them most and who are trying to be faithful guardians over them. The marriages contracted under such influences are not according to the order of God. Any young man who would lead a daughter away from duty, who would confuse her ideas of God's plain and positive commands to obey and honor her parents, is not one who would be true to the marriage obligations. Ingratitude is one of the greatest sins of the age.",
