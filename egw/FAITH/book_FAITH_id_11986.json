    "word": "Three Months After Minneapolis \n\n     When We Do Our Best.--Thank God it is not too late for wrongs to be righted. Christ looks at the spirit, and when He sees us carrying our burden with faith, His perfect holiness atones for our shortcomings. When we do our best, He becomes our righteousness. It takes every ray of light that God sends to us to make us the light of the world.--Letter 22, 1889. (Published in Selected Messages, book 1, p. 368.)",
