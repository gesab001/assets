    "word": "A man whose heart is touched with great love to souls for whom Christ died, will not make himself a center. He will not seek to absorb everything and impart nothing, but his work will be actuated by faith and love. He will realize that he is dealing with souls purchased with the blood of Christ, and he will not allow anything to make him lose sight of eternal realities. He will keep in mind the fact that everything in connection with his life and character is charged with sacred responsibilities, and through a living connection with God, his influence may have a leavening power upon those with whom he is associated. We cannot know the beauty and riches of the grace of Christ until we have made a practical application of the truth to our own hearts. Medical men, in addition to your medical education and training, you \n                                                                           207\nneed the mind that was in Christ Jesus. This will be to you righteousness and sanctification. No fiber of the root of selfishness can exist in the heart of the physician who entertains Christ as an honored guest. When you are emptied of self, Christ will supply the vacuum, and you will be actuated by the same spirit, moved by the same unselfish interest, that was manifested in the work of Christ for the perishing souls of men.",
