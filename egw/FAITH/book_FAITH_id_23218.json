    "word": "When you hear of words spoken that place you in an unenviable position, you are provoked. But you have not broken with Satan. You have parleyed with him, and efforts must be made to relieve the situation. Crooked paths must be made straight. You would be regarded by some as a fraud, entrusted with great responsibilities and yet unfaithful to the trust. God has been dishonored, and His cause betrayed into apparently insurmountable difficulties.",
