    "word": "Well, I see I have a work to do for my brethren and sisters. May the Lord give me grace, that I may be faithful, and do my whole duty in the love and fear of God. I dread these meetings and private interviews. Oh, that the souls of these erring ones may break before God, every one of them! There is a work to be done to set things in order both in the office and in the church. Then Jesus will walk in the midst of us.",
