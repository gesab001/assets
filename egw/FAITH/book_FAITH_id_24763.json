    "word": "May we heed well the solemn warning and make ready to enter into the wedding, that His house may be filled. God's Word informs us, \"Blessed are they \n\n\n                                     -9- \n\nthat do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" (Revelation 22:14). May we be found faithful, and give diligence to our calling, and possess the promised reward of the faithful, is my prayer.--Ms 8, 1874. (MR 900.56)",
