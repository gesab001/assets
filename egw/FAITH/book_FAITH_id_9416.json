    "word": "But there are thousands of prayers daily offered that God does not answer. There are faithless prayers. \"He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.\" Hebrews 11:6. There are selfish prayers, proceeding from a heart that is cherishing idols. . . . There are petulant, fretful prayers, murmuring because of the burdens and cares of life, instead of humbly seeking grace to lighten them. Those who offer such petitions are not abiding in Christ. They have not submitted their will to the will of God. They do not comply with the condition of the promise, and it is not fulfilled to them.",
