    "word": "Let this entire chapter be studied by those who claim to believe the truth for this time. Open the heart to the grace of Christ. While we lament deplorable errors, let us receive the precious lessons of instruction the Lord Jesus has given us. God requires every heart to be filled with pure, clean, sanctified, Christlike love. The love of Christ must not be lost out of our humanity. We are laborers together with God. Ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building. Christ declares, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" Then open the door of the heart and let Jesus in. He is the great worker as well as the law-giver. The members of our churches need to awake to the realization that they must have none of self and all of Jesus. We must cooperate with the Lord Jesus. The soul is to be awakened to cry aloud with every aspiration for the living God. Let your swelling, struggling heart break for the longing it has for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Let everyone who has had an experience in their life in Christ show an earnest faith in God as the true worker. Show that you realize that you are only a channel through which God works. Appreciate the fact that God is our efficiency. We do not remember this, and therefore we lose much in religious experience. We work ourselves in place of being worked by the Holy Spirit's power. We forget to regard ourselves as merely agents. \n                                                                           1701",
