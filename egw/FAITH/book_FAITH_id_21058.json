    "word": "When Bro. Waggoner decides in his judgment that a brother or sister is wrong, he is inclined to carry the matter through, and press his censure, although in doing so he hurts his own soul, and endangers the souls of others. Bro. Waggoner should shun church trials, and should have nothing to do in settling difficulties, if he can possibly avoid them. He has a valuable gift, which is needed in the work of God. But he should separate himself from influences which draw upon his sympathies, and confuse his judgment, and lead him to move unwisely. This should not and need not \n                                                                           135\nbe. Bro. Waggoner exercises too little faith in God. He dwells too much upon his bodily infirmities, and strengthens unbelief by dwelling upon poor feelings. God has strength and wisdom in store for those who seek for it earnestly, in faith believing.",
