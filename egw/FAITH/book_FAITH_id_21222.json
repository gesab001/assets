Let no one presume to move a pin or a foundation stone from the structure. Those who attempt to undermine the pillars of our faith are among those of whom the Bible says that \"in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\" Letter 87, 1905, pp. 2, 3. (To Elder and Mrs. S. N. Haskell, February 25, 1905.)",
