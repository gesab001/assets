    "word": "Our precious Saviour has given His life for the sins of the world, and has pledged His word that He will save all who come to Him. \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). These are the conditions of gaining eternal life. Comply with them, and your hope is secured, whether you live or die. Trust in the soul-saving Redeemer. Cast your helpless soul upon Him, and He will accept and bless and save you. Only believe. Receive Him with all your heart, and know that He wants you to win the crown of life. Let this be your greatest and most earnest request. Make an entire  surrender, and He will cleanse you from every pollution, and make you vessels unto honor. You may be washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. Thus you gain the victory....In faith hold fast.--Letter 45, 1905. \n                                                                           256",
