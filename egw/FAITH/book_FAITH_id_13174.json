    "word": "We have before us the case of Daniel and his fellows, who made the most of their opportunities to obtain an education in the courts of Babylon. When tested by those who questioned both their faith and their knowledge, they were able to give a reason of the hope that was in them, and, as well, to stand the examination as to their knowledge in all learning and wisdom; and it was found that Daniel had understanding also in all visions and dreams, showing that he had a living connection with the God of all wisdom. \"In all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.\" Daniel's history is given us for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come. \"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him.\" Daniel was in close connection with God. When the decree went forth from an angry, furious king, commanding that all the wise men of Babylon should be destroyed, Daniel and his fellows were sought for to be slain. Then Daniel answered, not with retaliation, but \"with counsel and wisdom,\" the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon. Daniel asked, \"Why is the decree so hasty from the king?\" He presented himself before the king, requesting that time be given him, and his faith in the God he served prompted him to say that he would show the king the interpretation. \"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, \n                                                                           215\nhis companions: that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.\" (Read Daniel 2:20-28.) Here the interpretation was made known to Daniel.",
