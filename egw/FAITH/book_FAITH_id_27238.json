    "word": "So much of self is cherished that the life of Christ in the soul is quenched. The truth that is presented tastes of the dish. The vessels need to be purified. There needs to be deeper ploughing in the heart, that the seeds of the eternal word of Christ may take root and spring up to bear fruit to the glory of God. The faith of many must be shallow, valueless in the sight of God, else the fruit would be of a different quality. There is need of deep heart-searching.",
