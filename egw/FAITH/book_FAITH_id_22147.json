    "word": "MR No. 435 - Mrs. White's Work and Travels in Australia\n\n     I am getting to be very tired of moving. It worries me out, settling and unsettling, gathering up manuscripts and scattering them, to be gathered up again. If I should look to my poor, finite self, I should soon become discouraged; but in looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith, I take courage, and press forward with His name on my lips to the mark for the prize of the high calling which is in Christ Jesus.--Letter 102, 1894, p. 1. (To Mr. and Mrs. J. E. White, February 6, 1894.)",
