    "word": "The trouble with the workers now is that they have not enough faith. They are too self-sufficient, and too easily disturbed by little trials. There is in the natural heart much selfishness, much self-dignity; and when they present the truth to an individual, and it is resented, they too frequently feel that it is an insult to themselves, when it is not themselves, but the Author of truth, who is insulted and rejected. In this work there is the greatest necessity of hiding self behind Jesus. The nearer one comes to Jesus, the less will he esteem himself, and the more earnest will he be to work for others in the spirit of the Master.",
