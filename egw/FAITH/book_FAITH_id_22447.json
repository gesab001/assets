    "word": "We had an excellent meeting, consulting in regard to how we shall bring our expense in the eating line within the low figures given for rooms, board, and tuition.

It is the Lord's anointed ones who keep their full hold of their own souls to impart knowledge and strength to the poor and needy ones.--Ms 173, 1897, p. 7. (Diary, June 30, 1897.)",
