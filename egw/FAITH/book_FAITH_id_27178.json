    "word": "Let everyone work on the principles of self-sacrifice. Work while the day lasts; for the night cometh, in which no man can work. As God's people work humbly, earnestly, self-sacrificingly, they will gain the rich rewards of which Job speaks, \"When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; the blessings of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.\" Christ will be acknowledged as the Creator and Redeemer. Those who are laborers together with God will be recognized and appreciated. The recognition of the faithful servants of God detracts not one iota from the gratitude and praise we offer to God and to the Lamb.",
