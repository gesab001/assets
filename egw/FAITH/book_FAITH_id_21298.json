    "word": "MR No. 59 - Statements Regarding the Oakland Church\n\n     I am instructed that we have an important work to do in Oakland at the present time. In the planning of this work wise counsellors are needed. The Lord calls for workers, earnest, prayerful, faithful workers to undertake that which needs to be done. We need many consecrated laborers to carry on missionary work in Oakland. In the surrounding settlements are also interests that should be cared for, where a call should be given to those in the highways and those in the byways.",
