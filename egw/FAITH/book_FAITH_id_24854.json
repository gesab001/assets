    "word": "As we go on step by step, trusting, believing, receiving the end of our faith, which is the salvation of our souls, the way will be made plain to us. But even though we may not always be able to tell why we are called to do this or that, we are to obey without questioning. Abraham was called to leave his Father's home. He could not see the future, but by faith he went into a strange country, not knowing whither he went. He was fully assured \n\n\n                                     -219- \n\nthat God knew and that all he had to do was to watch for divine guidance and move in obedience to the commands of God.",
