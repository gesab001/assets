    "word": "Now, my brother, you will meet with trials in little things, but hold fast your integrity. I know whereof I speak. \"Having done all to stand.\" Never show anything but a noble spirit, for all the universe of heaven is watching the result of the battle. Satan is watching to see you off guard, to see you stirred up to act impetuously, that he may obtain the advantage to sift you as wheat. I know that severe trials have come upon you. I know, for I have been shown occasions where you acted in words and spirit to please the enemy and to grieve heavenly angels. Provocation was given you, but I have been shown that you are to fight the battles of the Lord manfully, which means to do just as Christ would do were He in your place. There must be no inconsistency in your faith and practice.",
