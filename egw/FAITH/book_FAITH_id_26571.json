    "word": "Louder Than Words \n\n     In obeying the Saviour's injunction, our example will preach louder than words. The highest display of the power of truth is seen when \n                                                                           29\nthose who profess to believe it give evidence of their faith by their works. Those who believe this solemn truth should possess such a spirit of self-sacrifice as will rebuke the worldly ambition of the money worshiper.",
