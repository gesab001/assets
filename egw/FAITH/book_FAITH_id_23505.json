    "word": "What a precious meeting this was to us all. The Lord's presence was in the meeting, and His power to bless. This has been a season of taxing labor to me, but the Lord has given me strength for my day. Daniel says he is now going to cease building up himself, and propping up Daniel Bourdeau, and poring over his past difficulties. He says he never loved his brethren as now. He is going to talk faith and hope and courage, and be a strong man for God. May the Lord give him might in the inner man. He says the peace of God is in his heart.--Letter 23, 1885. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. April 10, 1986. Entire Letter.",
