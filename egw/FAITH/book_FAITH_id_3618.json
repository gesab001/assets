    "word": "Use Only Sound Arguments.--It is important that in defending the doctrines which we consider fundamental articles of faith, we should never allow ourselves to employ arguments that are not wholly sound.

We should present sound arguments, that will not only silence our opponents, but will bear the closest and most searching scrutiny.",
