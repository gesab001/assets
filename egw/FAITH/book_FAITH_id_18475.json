    "word": "The Lord does not give light in such a way as to leave the one addressed no chance to walk by faith. \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" (Hebrews 11:1). There is not a straight line marked out for any one of us. We need to pray and believe and watch unto prayer, ever praying and trusting. My brother, you must seek the Lord in order to know your duty. . . .",
