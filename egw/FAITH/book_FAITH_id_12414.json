    "word": "2. Living on a Low Level.--[1 Corinthians 3:1-3 quoted.] Those addressed in these words had not been feeding on Christ, and therefore they were not advanced in spiritual knowledge. Paul said, \"I have fed you with milk\"-- the plainest, most simple truths, suitable for converts young in the faith; \"not with meat\"--the solid, nourishing, spiritual food suited to those who have made progress in a knowledge of divine things. They were living on a low level, dwelling on the surface truths which call for no thought, no deep research (MS 70, 1901).",
