    "word": "The success of the Health Institute depends upon the thoroughness and entire faithfulness of every one connected with it. People come to the Institute from all parts of the country. They have learned from report that the establishment is conducted by Seventh-day Adventists, a people of peculiar faith, who dress plainly and seem to be out of joint with the world in many matters. They view with critical eye the deportment of superintendent, physicians and helpers. They naturally judge us by what they see revealed, and by that which is developed during the progress of their early acquaintance with us. Many, therefore, seeing the premises in so careless and really disgusting a condition, have turned away with decided dissatisfaction, pronouncing it a second or third grade institution that they would not patronize.",
