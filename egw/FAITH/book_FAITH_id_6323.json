    "word": "But what will it profit a person, if, after enduring persecution, he then gives up the truth? Christ gave his life for us, and now, if necessary, we should give our lives for him. We are his, for he has bought us; and we ought not to rob him of that for which he has made this infinite sacrifice. The third angel is represented as flying through heaven, proclaiming the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This message is to prepare a people for the coming of Christ. If men should refrain from proclaiming it, the very stones would cry out. The people must be warned. The words of the prophet are, \u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d We have a solemn work to do to proclaim this message of warning to the world. Are we engaging in this work? Will men arise in the Judgment and say, \u201cYou never told me that these things were so\u201d? Will the gates of the city of God be closed against us, or shall we dwell with Jesus through the ceaseless ages of eternity? We want to give to God all that there is of us. It is only to the faithful workers that the Saviour says, \u201cCome, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\u201d",
