    "word": "Christ is the ladder that Jacob saw, whose base rests upon the earth, and whose topmost round reaches into the highest heaven; and round after round, you must mount this ladder until you reach the everlasting kingdom.  There is no excuse for becoming more like Satan, more like human nature.  God has set before us the height of the Christian's privilege, and it is \"to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, \n                                                                           68\nthat ye might be filled with all the fulness of God\" (Ephesians 3:16-19).  -- 2SM 222,223.",
