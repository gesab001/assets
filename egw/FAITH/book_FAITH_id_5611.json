    "word": "And said Paul: \u201cIf the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised.  And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.\u201d [1 Corinthians 15:16-18.] If for four thousand years the righteous had gone directly to Heaven at death, how could Paul have said that if there is no resurrection, \u201cthey which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished\u201d? No resurrection would be necessary.",
