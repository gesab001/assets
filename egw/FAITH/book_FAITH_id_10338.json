    "word": "The humility of Solomon at the time he began to bear the burdens of state, when he acknowledged before God, \u201cI am but a little child\u201d (1 Kings 3:7), his marked love of God, his profound reverence for things divine, his distrust of self, and his exaltation of the infinite Creator of all\u2014all these traits of character, so worthy of emulation, were revealed during the services connected with the completion of the temple, when during his dedicatory prayer he knelt in the humble position of a petitioner. Christ\u2019s followers today should guard against the tendency to lose the spirit of reverence and godly fear. The Scriptures teach men how they should approach their Maker\u2014with humility and awe, through faith in a divine Mediator.\u2014(Prophets and Kings, 47, 48.)",
