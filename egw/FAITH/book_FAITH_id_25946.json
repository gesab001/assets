    "word": "We have had an experience in the work of God. There were times when the enemy came in great power to destroy: from hour to hour the men of faith had to depend on the blessings that came from God. The great topic of interest was, how to save the souls of those that were ready to perish. The great plan of salvation drew men close together in unity and love.

Holiness, and the author and finisher of our faith were the interesting subjects. Read Malachi 3:16, 17.",
