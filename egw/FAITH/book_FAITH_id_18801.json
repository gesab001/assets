    "word": "Need of Personal Experience--A clear, faithful testimony must be borne by every shepherd of the flock of God. The state of the heart is to be our first earnest concern. \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\" [Romans 10:10]. But mere speech is nothing. Preaching the Word, and then working contrary to the Word, makes that Word of none effect. Lip knowledge, forms and ceremonies, are of little value while Christ is not abiding in the soul.",
