    "word": "The life we now live must be by faith in the Son of God. The Christian life is a strangely mingled scene of sorrows and joys, disappointments and hopes, tears and confidence. There will be much dissatisfaction with self, as he views his own heart so deeply stirred, surged with passion that seems to bear all before it and then follows remorse and sorrow and repentance followed by peace and deep hidden joys, because he knows as his faith grasps the promises that are revealed in God's Word that he has the forgiving love of a long-suffering Saviour. \n\n\n                                 -9- \n\nAnd that Saviour he seeks to bring into his life, weave into His character.",
