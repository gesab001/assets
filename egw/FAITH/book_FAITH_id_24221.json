    "word": "My ministering brethren, talk faith; live the truth. We are bought with a price. We need to present the Word of truth as the sin-destroyer. Maintain simplicity. Talk the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Love as brethren. Be kind, pitiful, courteous. These words of instruction I have been commissioned to give to you, that you may give them to others.--Letter 188, 1906. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. June 8, 1989.
