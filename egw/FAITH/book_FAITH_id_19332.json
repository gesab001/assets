    "word": "Let there be an earnest consideration of these words. Let none say, \"That does not mean me; I am a Christian.\" Who says this, yourself, or he who reads the heart? The unfaithful steward had solemn responsibilities entrusted to him; before the world be appeared as a servant of Christ, but O, how deplorable for himself, and for all connected with him, he is an evil servant! He is imperiling his Lord's goods. He is teaching souls to trample upon the holy law of God. He calls Christ, My Lord. But he says, \"My Lord delayeth his coming.\" He does not say that Christ will not come; he does not scoff at the idea of his second coming; but he tells the people that his coming is delayed. He is removing from the minds of others the conviction that the Lord is coming quickly. His influence leads men to presumptuous, careless delay. Thus they are off their watch and they echo the words of the unfaithful watcher; still others catch them up, and the evil spirit, and men are confirmed in their worldliness and stupor. Their course is downward, not upward; they are not looking for and hasting unto the day of God. Earthly passions, corrupt thoughts, take possession of the mind.",
