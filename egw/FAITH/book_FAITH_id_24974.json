    "word": "Many seem to think if they are not treated as they should be that a proper course is for them to say, Well, I am not going to work any longer, I am going to lay off from duty for awhile. Is not God your Father? and is it not Him you are serving? Are we not to serve Him in our disappointments, as well as in prosperity? If we keep our eye single to the glory of God, we shall not be troubled with these days of darkness and gloom. We are to have our eyes fixed on the sacrifice that Christ has made for us, on the beams of His righteousness that are let fall on us through faith in that sacrifice, and then His hand shall brush away the cloud that comes between Him and us. We should not stumble over these small trials, and tell them over to others. Look up! Look up! We do not get any encouragement or strength by looking down.",
