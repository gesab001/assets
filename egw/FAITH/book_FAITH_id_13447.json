    "word": "Looking upon his faithful followers, Jesus said, \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.\" He then informed them of his approaching separation from them. The ardent Peter could not rest while the matter remained in uncertainty. He inquired, \"Lord, whither goest thou?\" Jesus answered, \"Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterward.\" But Peter's interest was intensely roused, and he urged Jesus to explain his full meaning, saying, \"Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.\" Jesus answered sorrowfully, \"Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.\" Then, looking with pitying love upon his little flock, so soon to be left without a shepherd, he sought to draw their minds from the perplexity into which his statements had thrown them, and said tenderly, \"Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.\"",
