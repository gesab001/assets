    "word": "The worker who labor in humble dependence upon God, seeking His counsel at every step, will be guided by heavenly wisdom. Let them not trust in their own feeble efforts, but trust in God and pray to Him in faith. Ever remember that \"the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.\" We need to cultivate that persevering faith which will hold fast to the promises. Humble yourself, but exalt God. \n\n\n                                      -132- \n\nEmpty the soul of selfishness and sin, and lay hold of God's power. Then you can claim His promise, \"Ask, and ye shall receive.\"",
