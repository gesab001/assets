    "word": "If the churches expect strength, they must live the truth God has given them. If the members of our churches show that they care not for the light on health reform, but continue to walk in the light of the sparks of their own kindling, they will lie down in sorrow. And the painful part of the history is that the influence of these older church members will leaven those newly come to the faith. The Lord could not now bring many souls into the truth because of the church members that have never been converted and those who were once converted but who have backslidden. What good would these unconsecrated members do the new converts? They would make of none effect the message God has given His people to bear.",
