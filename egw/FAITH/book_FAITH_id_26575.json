    "word": "Laborers with God \n\n     We are not left alone in this work. We are laborers together with God, in partnership with divine resources. The Lord has agencies that He will put in operation in answer to the importunate prayer of faith. He will fulfill His word, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" The Captain of our salvation is on every field of battle where truth is waging war against error. The truth which we profess offers the highest encouragement to the most devoted self-denial and persevering effort that mortal energies can bestow. We should have the courage of heroes and the faith of martyrs.--Historical Sketches of S.D.A. Foreign Missions, pp. 290-294.",
