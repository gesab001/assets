    "word": "The leaders of churches in every place should be earnest, full of zeal and unselfish interest. They should make their request to God in faith; pray short and to the point; speak short and interestingly. Long prayers and exhortations are all uncalled for. If the brethren and sisters have something to say that will edify and refresh others, they will be men and women connected with God, drawing their supplies from His exhaustless storehouse. They will bring from the storehouse of God things new and old. If their own souls have been sanctified by the Spirit of God, they will cheer, strengthen, and encourage others. If they themselves have not drunk at the fountain of salvation, they will not know how to lead others to the fountain.",
