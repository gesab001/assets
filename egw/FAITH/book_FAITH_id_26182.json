    "word": "Again, Paul writes, \"If the first fruits be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the fruit be holy so are the branches. And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partaketh of the root and fatness of the olive tree, boast not against the branches, but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in. Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high minded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God, on them which fell, severity, but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in His goodness; otherwise thou also shall be cut off.\" Romans 11:16-22. Very plainly these words show that there is to be no disparaging of the agencies which God has placed in the church.",
