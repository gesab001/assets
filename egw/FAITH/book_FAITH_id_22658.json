    "word": "Have I not a knowledge of how to present these things without spoiling the faith of our people? I shall write just as God bids me write. What I have written, I have written. Every word is truth. I am to give to the people of God the warnings given me. But I am not to send these warnings in private letters to those who claim to be vindicating the truth, while in reality they are leading in a false track.
