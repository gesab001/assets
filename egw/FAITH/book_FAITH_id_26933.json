Some of our institutions are prospering; some seem to have come to a standstill; and others are running behind. As I present our perplexities to the Lord, there comes to my mind with considerable force this scripture, \"Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither fruit be in the vine; and the labor of the olive shall fail, and the flock shall be cut off from the fold; and there shall be no herd in the stall; yet I will rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my salvation.\"",
