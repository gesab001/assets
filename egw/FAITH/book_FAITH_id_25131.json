    "word": "-311- \n\n     God looks with sadness upon the unworked cities. The message has come to us, Work the cities quickly. The Lord would be pleased to see His messengers go forth as Christ, the Son of the living God, went forth. He is our example. He would be pleased to see our conferences laying plans for progressive work in our cities, to build up the old waste places. He would be pleased to hear the truth proclaimed wisely by every believer. Lack of faith has greatly hindered the work of God. There are decided reformations to be made. Our cities East and West and North and South are to be given the message of present truth. Companies are to go forth into the highways and the hedges searching for the scattered sheep.",
