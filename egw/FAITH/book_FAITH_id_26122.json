    "word": "The Lord has lessons for us all to learn regarding the position we should occupy toward each other and toward Him. Let no Pharisaical pride come into our ranks, but let us move humbly and wisely, putting from our hearts and minds every injurious thought and feeling. The spirit of selfishness that would lead a man to set himself above his brethren is evidence that he does not see the necessity of being a humble learner in Christ's school. The precious word of God is to be faithfully studied if God's professing people are to find a place among the redeemed.",
