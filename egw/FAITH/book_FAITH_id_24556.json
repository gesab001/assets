    "word": "Do you individually realize that you are in the presence of the unseen Watcher? Your individual ways and temperaments need to be fashioned after the divine similitude. Constantly you need to cultivate and cherish the thought, I am in the presence of One whom I love and fear and reverence. But He is seen only by the eye of faith. I must think no thought and do no action in my own spirit or after my own inclination. Unless I have the mind and the Spirit of God I cannot safely be trusted with sacred responsibilities. My mind, my judgment must not rule. The mind and judgment of the great I AM must rule.",
