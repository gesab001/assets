    "word": "The Lord will have faithful men who love and fear him connected with every school, every printing office, health institution and publishing house. Their wages should not be fashioned after the worldling's standard. There \n                                                                           396\nshould be, as far as possible, excellent judgment exercised to keep up, not an aristocracy, but an equality, which is the law of heaven, \"All ye are brethren\" (Matthew 23:8). A few should not demand large wages, and such wages should not be presented as an inducement to secure ability and talents. This is placing things on a worldly principle. The increase of wages brings with it a corresponding increase of selfishness, pride, display, self-gratification and needless extravagance that the people who do their utmost to pay their tithes and present their offerings to God do not have. Poverty is seen in all their borders. The Lord loves the ones just as much as the other, with the exception that the self-sacrificing, humble, contrite souls who love God and strive to serve Him, are ever kept nearer to the great heart of infinite love than the man who feels at liberty to have all the good things of this life.
