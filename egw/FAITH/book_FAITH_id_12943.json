    "word": "Will the Saviour ever turn away to leave you to struggle alone? No, never. . . . Poverty is coming upon this world, and there will be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation. There will be wars and rumors of wars, and the faces of men will gather paleness. You may have to suffer distress; you may go hungry sometimes; but God will not forsake you in your suffering. He will test your faith. . . . We are here to manifest Christ to the world, to represent Him and His power to mankind. \n                                                                           196",
