    "word": "I have been shown so much of human imperfection in those who have the oversight of churches, that I dare not utter one word of praise of commendation to any man. Let the laborers so live and so work that they can have the approval of God, and they will not be relying upon human sympathy, living upon human praise, that so frequently comes from unsanctified lips. They will be looking unto the Author and Finisher of our faith.",
