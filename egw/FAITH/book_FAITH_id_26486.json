    "word": "The medical school at Loma Linda is to be of the highest order, because we have a living connection with the wisest of all physicians, from whom there is communicated knowledge of a superior order. And whatever subjects are required as essential in the school conducted by those not of our faith, we are to supply so that our youth need not go to those worldly schools. Thus we shall close the door that the enemy would be pleased to have left open; and our young men and young women, whom the Lord would have us guard religiously, will not then need to connect with worldly medical schools conducted by unbelievers. \n\n                                               -",
