    "word": "Let our ministers consecrate themselves to God. We need so much,--O so much!--humble men, who feel it a pleasure to do their very best. A glorious gospel work opens before the converted, faithful minister. He is to help his fellow-men to a better understanding of the Word. The influence exerted by the minister with whom God works is weighty and momentous. The Lord is highly pleased with the minister who works humbly and willingly. Those who are wholly consecrated to God will ever seek wisdom from on high to enable them to bear their heavy responsibilities. They will be patient, forbearing, \n\n\n                         -5- \n\ncourteous, knowing that they are Christ's representatives. They will show a deep earnestness and fervor in prayer, and in their appeals to individuals and congregations.",
