    "word": "We must all be rich in good works in this life, if we would secure the future, immortal life. When the judgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened, every man will be rewarded according to his works.

And unless these repent, and work for the Master with disinterested benevolence, they will certainly share in the doom of the unfaithful steward.",
