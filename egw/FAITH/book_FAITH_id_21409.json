    "word": "The Lord would have the subjects of His kingdom represent the character of their Sovereign. His commandments are not left for man to trim down to suit his ideas or his convenience. God's great moral standard is His ten precepts, the foundation of the faith of prophets and apostles. The Sabbath is the great test question, and He has made precious promises to those who keep His Sabbath from polluting it. His infinite wisdom and power and love are engaged in our behalf. The heavenly host are registering our names as among the loyal and the true. It is safe always to be on the Lord's side, and by faith to commit our whole interest, temporal and eternal, into the hands of Him who reigns over all in heaven and on earth. \n\n\n                                    -120-",
