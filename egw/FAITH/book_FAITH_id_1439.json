We meet together to edify one another by an interchange of thoughts and feelings, to gather strength, and light, and courage by becoming acquainted with one another's hopes and aspirations; by our earnest, heartfelt prayers, offered up in faith, we receive refreshment and vigor from the Source of our strength.--Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 578.",
