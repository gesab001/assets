    "word": "The brethren err when they leave this work all to the ministers. The harvest is great, and the laborers are few. Those who are of good repute, whose lives are in accordance with their faith, can be workmen. They can converse with others, and urge upon them the importance of the truth. They must not wait for the ministers, and neglect a plain duty which God has left for them to perform. [\"TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH,\" VOL. I, PP. 368, 369.]",
