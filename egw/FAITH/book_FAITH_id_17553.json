    "word": "The world is no longer his study and his god. He hungers for a knowledge of the Word which contains for him treasures that are to be constantly sought and are constantly satisfying--an inexhaustible mine of precious things to be sought for in faith, to be appropriated and communicated to others. He has discovered the fountain of living waters, the wells of salvation, from which he may continually draw, and there will be no diminishing of the supply.",
