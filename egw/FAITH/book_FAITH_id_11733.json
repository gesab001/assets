    "word": "The Shadows of Satan [APPEARED IN \n      NOTEBOOK LEAFLETS, THE CHURCH, NO. 3.] \n\n\n     Bear in mind that the time will never come when the shadow of Satan will not be cast athwart our pathway to obstruct our faith and eclipse the light coming from the Sun of Righteousness. Our faith must not stagger, but cleave through that shadow. We have an experience that is not to be buried in the darkness of doubt. Our faith is not in feeling, but in truth. None of us need flatter ourselves that while the world is progressing in wickedness we shall have no difficulties.",
