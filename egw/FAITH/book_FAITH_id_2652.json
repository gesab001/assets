    "word": "To everyone Christ gives the command, \"Go work today in My vineyard for the glory of My name. Represent before a world laden with corruption the blessedness of true education. The weary, the heavy-laden, the brokenhearted, the perplexed--point them to Christ, the source of all strength, all life, all hope.\" To teachers the word is spoken, \"Be faithful minutemen. Seek for the higher education, for entire conformity to the will of God. You will surely reap the reward that comes from its reception. As you place yourselves where you can be recipients of the blessing of God, the name of the Lord will be magnified through you.\"",
