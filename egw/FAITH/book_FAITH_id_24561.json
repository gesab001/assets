Daniells. A portion of this manuscript appears in Evangelism, and in MR Nos. 325, 454.) \n\n\n     I understand the situation to which you refer in your letter. While in Cooranbong I was shown that the enemy would make most determined efforts to ensnare those who with proper instruction would be strong co-workers with Christ. All who desire to qualify themselves for the Lord's work are the objects of Satan's attacks. If all would live the prayer offered by the Saviour to His Father just before His betrayal and crucifixion, the unity and love represented in that prayer would be a impregnable wall which would withstand the assaults of the enemy. But when there is dissension, when each seeks the highest place, the prayer of Christ is not answered and there is weakness instead of strength.",
