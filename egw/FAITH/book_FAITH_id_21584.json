    "word": "MR No. 184 - Ellen White at Tramelan, Switzerland\n\n     We arrived at Tramelan about noon Friday, May 21, 1886, and were welcomed by the family of Brother Roth. Brother and Sister Roth are most excellent people, wholehearted in the truth. They have now living seven sons and three daughters. One daughter died in the faith not long since. All are established in the truth that are old enough to understand. Their family are in the best circumstances of any of our people in Switzerland. The father and eldest son are merchant tailors. The second son is a baker, but has given himself to the missionary work, and is fitting up for a laborer. He is a young man of superior ability. One young woman is working in the office at Basel. She understands French, German, and English. The third son is also working in the office. We enjoyed our visit with this dear family.--Ms 20, 1886, p. 5. (No title, June 11, 1886.)",
