    "word": "The case of Daniel is an instructive one. Daniel was taught by God, and he cooperated with God. He exerted all his powers to work out his own salvation, and God worked in him to will and to do according to His good pleasure. Of Daniel and his companions it is written, \"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams\" [Daniel 1:17]. These youth were sincere, faithful Christians. True education must be all-sided, not one-sided. Such an education Daniel and his fellows were determined to have. They sought to acquire knowledge for a purpose, to honor and glorify God. They must perfect a Christian character and have a clear intellect in order to stand as the representatives of the true religion amid the false religions of heathenism.",
