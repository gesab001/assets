    "word": "Washington, D.C., Sunday, December 21, 1890 \n\n     We attended the forenoon meeting of the Week of Prayer at half-past ten o'clock. There were only about thirty present. The two first letters in The Home Missionary were read, and when Brother Baker, who is a new convert \n                                                                           768\nto the faith from the Methodist church, read the portions quoted from testimonies he was so affected he could not read. He wished Elder Washburn to read it. But Elder Washburn encouraged him to go on and he read with much feeling. There was great solemnity all over the house, and many tears. We then had a most impressive season of prayer. The Spirit of the Lord did come into the meeting and we had a precious season of seeking the Lord. I then spoke about thirty minutes with much freedom.",
