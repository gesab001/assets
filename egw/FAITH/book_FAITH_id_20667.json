    "word": "The Foundation.--The Bible should not be brought into our schools to be sandwiched in between infidelity. The Bible must be made the groundwork and subject-matter of education. It is true that we know much more of the word of the living God than we knew in the past, but there is still much more to be learned. It should be used as the word of the living God and esteemed as first, and last, and best in everything. Then will be seen true spiritual growth. The students will develop healthy, religious characters; because they eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God. But, unless watched and nurtured, the health of the soul decays. Keep in the channel of light. Study the Bible. Those who serve God faithfully will be blessed. He who permits no faithful work to go unrewarded will crown every act of loyalty and integrity with special tokens of his love and approbation--Test., \"The Bible in Our Schools.\"",
