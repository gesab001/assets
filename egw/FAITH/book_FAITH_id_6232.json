    "word": "Do not make it appear to any one that the road to heaven is an unpleasant path. Show by your words and actions that although this road is too straight and narrow to be entered with the burden of the world and of pride and self-importance, it is a precious way, cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in. Although marked with trials and discouragements, it may be made, through faith and determined effort to defeat the enemy, a victorious, triumphant way.",
