    "word": "God's tried servants must not be put in hard places. Those who served their Master when the work went hard, those who endured poverty and remained faithful in the love of the truth when our numbers were small, are ever to be honored and respected. Let those who have come into the truth in later years, take heed to these words. God desires all to heed this caution.--Letter 47, 1902. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nSeptember 14, 1989. Entire Letter.",
