    "word": "The Reformation was greatly retarded by making prominent differences on some points of faith, and each party holding tenaciously to these things where they differed. We shall see eye to eye ere long. But to become firm, and consider it your duty to present your views in decided opposition to the faith or truth as it has been taught by us as a people, is a mistake, and will result in harm, and only harm, as in the days of Martin Luther.",
