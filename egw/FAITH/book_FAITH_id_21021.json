    "word": "Bro. Gage has ability in some respects that but few have. He could fill an important position in the Office with acceptance to God, if his heart was sanctified to the work. He needs to be converted, and to humble himself as a little child, in seeking pure, heart religion, in order for his influence in the Office, or in the cause of God anywhere, to be what it ought to be. As his influence has been, it has injured all connected with the Office, but more \n                                                                           27\nespecially the young. His position as foreman gave him influence. He did not conduct himself conscientiously in the fear of God. He favored particular ones above others. He neglected those who, for their faithfulness and ability, deserved special encouragement. He brought distress and perplexity upon those in whom he should have had a special interest. Those who link their affections and interest to one or two, and favor them to the disadvantage of others, should not retain their position in the Office for a day. This unsanctified partiality for special ones who may please the fancy, to the neglect of others who are conscientious and God-fearing, and in his sight of more value, is offensive to God. That which God esteems, we should value. The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, God regards of higher value than external beauty, outward adornment, riches, or worldly honor.",
