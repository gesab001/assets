    "word": "An Earnest Work for Souls.--Work for the salvation of souls as though you knew by sight that you were in full view of the whole universe of heaven. Every angel in glory is interested in the work being done for the salvation of souls. We are not awake as we should be. All the angelic host are our helpers. \"The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in His love, He will joy over thee with singing.\" O cannot we then work with courage and faith. \"In that day it will be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.\" Only have faith. Pray and believe, and ye shall see the salvation of God.--Letter 126, 1896. \n                                                                           283",
