    "word": "Presently an angel bid me rise, and the sight that met my eyes can hardly be described. A company was presented before me whose hair and garments were torn, and whose countenances were the very picture of despair and horror. They came close to me, and took their garments and rubbed them on mine, I looked at my garments, and saw that they were stained with blood, and that blood was eating holes in my garments. Again I fell like one dead, at the feet of my accompanying angel. I could not plead one excuse. My tongue refused all utterance, and I longed to be away from such a holy place. Again the angel stood me up on my feet, and said \u201cThis is not your case now, but this scene has passed before you, to let you know what your situation must be, if you neglect to declare to others what the Lord has revealed to you. But if you are faithful to the end, you shall eat of the tree of life, and shall drink \n64\nof the river of the water of life. You will have to suffer much, but the grace of God is sufficient.\u201d I then felt willing to do all that the Lord might require me to do, that I might have his approbation, and not feel his dreadful frown.",
