The inquiry should be made, \"What am I, and what is my work and mission in this time? On which side am I working--Christ's side or the enemy's side?\" Let every soul now humble himself or herself before God, for now we are surely living in the great Day of Atonement. The cases even now of many are passing in review before God, for they are to sleep in their graves a little season.
