    "word": "The message was brought to Asa by the Lord's prophet: \"The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you\" (2 Chronicles 15:2; cf. Jeremiah 29:11-13). My heart goes out in faith. Faith is not feeling; faith is not sight. \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" (Hebrews 11:1).",
