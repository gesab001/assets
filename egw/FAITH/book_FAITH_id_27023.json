    "word": "These little things are of much more importance than many suppose in the education of students. Businessmen will notice the appearance of the wagons and harnesses, and will form their opinions accordingly. And more than this, if students are allowed to go through school with slack, shiftless habits, their education will not be worth half as much as it would be if they were taught to be thorough in all they do. \u201cHe that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\u201d Little things needing attention, yet left for days and weeks till they become an unsightly neglect, teach\n22\nthe students lessons that will cling to them for a lifetime, greatly hindering them in their work. Such an example is demoralizing, and students whose education is after this order are not needed in the world.",
