    "word": "God has placed in our hands a banner on which is inscribed the words, \"The commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\" \"Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and have the testimonies of Jesus Christ,\" He declares. At all times and in all places we are to hold the banner firmly aloft. God's denominated people are to take a firm stand under the banner of truth. The truths that we have been proclaiming for more than half a century have been contested again and again. Again and again the facts of faith have been disputed; but every time the Lord has established the truth by the working of His Holy Spirit. Those who have arisen to question and overthrow the principles of present truth, have been sternly rebuked. \n\n\n                                      -46-",
