    "word": "Minister, teacher, medical missionary, and canvasser should respect and appreciate each other.--The preaching of the Word is a means by which the Lord has ordained that His warning message shall be given to the world. In the Scriptures the faithful teacher is represented as a shepherd of the flock of God. He is to be respected and his work appreciated. Genuine medical missionary work is bound up with the ministry, and the canvassing work is to be a part both of the medical missionary work and of the ministry.--6T 323.",
