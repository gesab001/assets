But He cannot work through us if we make no effort. If we gain eternal life, we must work, and work earnestly. . . . Let us not be deceived by the oft-repeated assertion, \"All you have to do is to believe.\" Faith and works are two oars which we must use equally if we [would] press our way up the stream against the current of unbelief. \"Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\" The Christian is a man of thought and practice. His faith fixes its roots firmly in Christ. By faith and good works he keeps his spirituality strong and healthy, and his spiritual strength increases as he strives to work the works of God.--Review and Herald, June 11, 1901.",
