    "word": "Guard Spiritual Digestion.--\"I do not like to go much beyond the half hour,\" said a faithful and earnest preacher, who certainly never gave to his hearers that which cost him nothing in the preparation. \"I know that the spiritual digestion of some is but weak, and I should be sorry for my hearers to spend the second half hour in forgetting what I had said in the first, or in wishing that I would cease when I had given them as much as they could carry away.\"--Letter 47, 1886.",
