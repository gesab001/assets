    "word": "There are grand principles set before us in the Word of God, but these are not to be considered too pure and holy to be brought into the business life. Through the reception of Christ as our personal Saviour, the precious gems which that Word contains become to us threads of gold that bind us to Christ and to each other. In loving one another as Christ has loved humanity, we receive sanctification of the soul and obtain that faith which works by love and purifies the soul. When the leaven of truth is implanted in the heart, it absorbs to itself all the capabilities of mind and soul and strength. It implants in the human being a new nature, and the grace of Christ is more and more developed.",
