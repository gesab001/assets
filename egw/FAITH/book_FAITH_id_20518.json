    "word": "The Superintendent \n\n     Wisdom is needed in the selection of managers in the various departments. It is impossible for one to control others until he learns to control himself. The superintendent should be a man who loves and fears God. He should sacredly guard his reputation, giving no occasion for anyone to reproach the cause of God. He should not be narrow-minded, a man of one idea. One who is changeable, now indulgent, then cold and unapproachable, or critical, exacting, and domineering, is not \n                                                                           5\nfitted for this position, nor is he who will cherish suspicion, jealousy, passion, or stubbornness. These traits are not pleasing to God, and will not be manifested by any who take Jesus for their pattern and counselor. The superintendent must manifest the spirit of Christ; yet he should be firm to restrain evil. A neglect of this duty shows him to be unfit for his position. God requires of a steward that he be found faithful. A manager must be a growing man in order to meet the difficulties as well as the opportunities that are constantly arising. He should be quick to discern what needs to be done, and take active measures to accomplish the work at the right time. There are many rules made, many regulations passed, that fall dead because they are not carried into effect. Time is spent in board meetings, councils, and business meetings, matters are discussed, and resolutions made; and then if these resolutions die a natural death, things are left in a worse state than if no action had been taken.",
