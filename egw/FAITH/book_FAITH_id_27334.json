    "word": "You have in the past done much to bring means into circulation in the work of God. And you need not now feel troubled about \n\n\n                                      -412- \n\naccepting gifts and free-will offerings; for you will need them in the work of preparing young men and women to labor in the Lord's vineyard. As you carry on this work in harmony with the Lord's will, you are not to be kept on a constant strain to know how to secure the means you need in order to go forward. The Lord forbids the setting up of walls and bands around workers of experience who are faithfully acting their God-appointed part.",
