    "word": "If we would obtain an all-round experience, we must plow deep for truth and wisdom. We must cultivate faith in the Word of God. The alpha and omega of our experience must be \"Thus saith the Lord.\" As brethren, located where you must be more or less connected in your work, you must draw closer together, in your counsels, in your associations, in spirit, and in all your work. Each one among you is to stand nobly in his lot and place, doing the work which God has committed to him. Every individual among you must do for these last days a work that is great and sacred and grand. Every one must bear his weight of responsibility before God. The Lord is preparing each one to do his appointed work, and each one is to be honored and respected as a brother chosen of God and precious in his sight. No one man among you is to be made the counsellor for all. One man is not to be selected as the one to whom all plans and methods shall be referred, while others are not consulted. If this is done, errors will appear, wrong moves will be made, and harm rather than good will be done. No one should be afraid of the other, lest he shall have highest place. Each is to be treated without partiality and without hypocrisy.",
