    "word": "It is now half past five o'clock, and I am writing. I look back and review the experience of the time we have spent in Brooklyn. It has been a season long to be remembered. Several of our ministering brethren were present at this meeting. There were many more in numbers composing the church in New York City and Brooklyn than we expected to see. We were much pleased with the intelligence of those who had taken their position on the commandments of God. We were happily disappointed to meet so many of like precious faith coming in from other churches. I spoke four times in public assembly and four times in the morning meetings and conference meetings. I was blessed with much freedom. There seemed to be no unbelief and prejudice to block the way and no exercise of a spirit in any way to counteract the influence of the testimony given me to bear to the people. My spirit was \n\n\n                                    -310- \n\nrefreshed while seeking to comfort others with the same consolation and hope wherewith I was comforted.",
