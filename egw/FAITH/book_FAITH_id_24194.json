    "word": "Some of your lengthy discourses would have far better effect upon the people if cut up into three. The people cannot digest so much; their minds cannot even grasp it, and they become wearied and confused by having so much matter brought before them in one discourse. Two-thirds of such long discourses are lost, and the preacher is exhausted. \n\n\n                                     -134- \n\nThere are many of our ministers who err in this respect. The result upon themselves is not good; for they become brain weary and feel that they are carrying heavy loads for the Lord and having a hard time. Thus they begin to ponder over their feelings and pity themselves and remove their eyes from Jesus, the author and finisher of their faith. Jesus does not ask this sacrifice on their part; He requires obedience rather than sacrifice.",
