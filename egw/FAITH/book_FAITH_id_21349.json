    "word": "Monday, Elder Smith came to me and we had an earnest, faithful talk. I could see that he had a very different spirit from that he had months ago. He was not hard and unimpressible; he felt the words I spoke to him, laying before him faithfully the course he had taken and the harm he had done through this position. He said he wanted to come into harmony with the testimonies of the Spirit of God. I had written to him thirteen pages and sent it to him--very plain words. Tuesday he called again to see me and asked if I would meet with a select few, that he had something to say. I told him I would.",
