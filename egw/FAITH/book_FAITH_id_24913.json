    "word": "Says the apostle: \"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word \n\n\n                                   -373- \n\nand deed\" [verse 18]. \"Wrought by me.\" How did God work through Paul? Through a multitude of revelations whereby he might \"make the Gentiles obedient.\" Paul had many wonderful visions. He saw that which could not be described by mortal man, and concerning these visions he remained nearly silent; but, nevertheless, God \"wrought\" through His servant by the abundance of His revelations, to accompany Paul's preaching with a power that could not be withstood. So thoroughly was Paul's faith substantiated by these visions that his message was ever \"Yea and Amen.\" He could not think of consenting to say \"Nay\" when he had formerly said \"Yea.\" His words were established by a weight of evidence that was immovable.",
