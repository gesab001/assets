    "word": "God would have His children realize that in order to glorify Him their affection must be given to those who most need it. . . . No selfishness, in look, word, or deed, is to be manifested when dealing with those of like precious faith, . . . whether they be high or low, rich or poor. The love that gives kind words to only a few, while others are treated with coldness and indifference, is not love, but selfishness. It will not in any way work for the good of souls or the glory of God. Our love . . . is not to be sealed up for special ones, to the neglect of others. Break the bottle, and the fragrance will fill the house.",
