    "word": "Marian, I am praying for you, that the Lord will spare your life that you may remain with me. I hope we may not be separated again. Do not refuse to eat nourishing food. It is not the will of God that you should starve yourself. Eat regularly, that you may gain in strength. Do all that you can to aid in your recovery, and may the Lord comfort your soul. In Him is strength. Look unto Jesus, the Author and the Finisher of your faith. If you continue to look to Him, you will be made like Him in character. I very much wish that I could be there to help you, but as this is impossible, I must be reconciled to what I cannot prevent.",
