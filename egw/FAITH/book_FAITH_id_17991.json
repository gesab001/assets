    "word": "A truly honest man will never take advantage of weakness or incompetency in order to fill his own purse. He accepts a fair equivalent for that which he sells. If there are defects in the articles sold, he frankly tells his brother or his neighbor, although by so doing he may work against his own pecuniary interests. In all the details of life the strictest principles of honesty are to be maintained. These are not the principles which govern our world, for Satan--deceiver, liar, and oppressor--is the master, and his subjects follow him and carry out his purposes. But Christians serve under a different Master, and their actions must be wrought in God, irrespective of all selfish gain. Deviation from perfect fairness in a business deal may appear as a small thing in the estimation of some, but our Saviour did not thus regard it. His words on this point are plain and explicit: \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much\" (Luke 16:10). . . .",
