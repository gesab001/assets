    "word": "There need not be a cloud between the soul and Jesus. Why do so large a number who profess to believe in Christ have so limited a view of the life-giving power of Christ? We are not one of us to act as if the Word, the life, and light, was to be given to us grudgingly. His great heart of love is longing to flood the soul with the bright beams of His righteousness. \"Whoso is athirst let him come and take of the water of life freely.\" We are acting as if we must only taste, when our faith should say, \"Let me drink of Thy fullness.\" Faith, living genuine faith, is required. We are privileged to receive of the abundant supply. Then our duty is, \"Freely ye have received, freely give.\"",
