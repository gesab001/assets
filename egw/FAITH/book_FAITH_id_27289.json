    "word": "Then the Saviour stretched out his hand, saying: \"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light and of the day. If ye be obedient to the knowledge ye have received from my word, then walk according to my word, ye are the children of the day. Ye are not of the night, nor of darkness, therefore ye are not to sleep as do others, but to watch and be sober. Walk as children of the day. You all need a more earnest hold upon heavenly things. All need the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. You have not already attained, neither are you now perfect. A work of purification should now be done in your souls, then your lives will demonstrate that you are pressing toward the mark of your high calling in Christ Jesus.",
