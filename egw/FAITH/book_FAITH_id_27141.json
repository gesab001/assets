    "word": "Take up the stones, remove the rubbish from your hearts. Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. God's servants need constantly to lay hold with one hand of souls ready to perish, while with the hand of faith they lay hold of the throne of God. Souls possessed with evil spirits will present themselves before us. We must cultivate the spirit of earnest prayer, mingled with genuine faith to save them from ruin, and this will confirm our faith.",
