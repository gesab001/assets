    "word": "II. Ministry Applies and Completes Transaction of Cross \n\n\n     The intercession of Christ in man's behalf in the sanctuary above is as essential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the cross. By His death He began that work which after His resurrection He ascended to complete in heaven. We must by faith enter within the veil, \"whither the forerunner is for us entered.\" Hebrews 6:20. There the light from the cross of Calvary is reflected. There we may gain a clearer insight into the mysteries of redemption.--The Great Controversy, p. 489.",
