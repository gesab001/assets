    "word": "Christ Their Counselor\n     Christ said to his disciples before his crucifixion, \u201cI will pray the Father, and he shall give you  another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.\u201d [John 14:16, 17.] Thank God we have not to trust alone in human counsel. The Saviour says, \u201cI have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.\u201d [Revelation 3:8.] To this open door we are to go by faith for our sufficiency.",
