    "word": "Those who have known the truth, who have been blessed by the influence of the Holy Spirit, who have appreciated the truth, but have turned from it, will not be treated merely as impenitent sinners. Their guilt is aggravated, because they have had a knowledge of the truth. They have a knowledge of the defections of church members, and of the difficulty which those in the faith have experienced because of the weak sinful characters of those in the church militant. They can misrepresent the words and actions of the faithful servants of God, who strive to place the straying feet of the erring in the path of holiness. They can put the worst construction on the words and actions of those who labor for the erring. If they are not converted, if they do not choose to put away their evil speaking, if they corrupt their ways before the Lord, they will misinterpret the words of God's servants, and the whole world will rise up in the day of judgment against them. . . .",
