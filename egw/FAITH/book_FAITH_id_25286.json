    "word": "If Christ is abiding in your heart, you will show meekness and gentleness and purity of thought. You will follow elevated, noble principles, because you have learned the lessons taught in the school of Christ. If you have not felt the need of learning every day in this school, it is time you did feel this need. Learn of Christ, and then go forth in the strength of Him who has said, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" A divided heart God will not accept. Put your whole soul into your work, and never leave your work half done because you wish to go to another place. God will accept only faithful work. Reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine. Bind off your work thoroughly. Leave no dropped stitches for someone else to pick up. Do not disappoint Christ. Determine that you will succeed, and in the strength of Christ you may give full proof of your ministry. \n                                                                           143",
