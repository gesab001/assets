    "word": "When the ministers go forth to lift Christ among those who must hear the message of mercy, the class who appreciate the gospel so little, who are not doers of the truth, is the first to feel aggrieved because the word of truth is carried to those who have not had the privilege of hearing it. These hearers, who listen to the most solemn message but have closed the door of the heart against it, have no burden for the perishing souls around them, and are themselves dead in trespasses and sins. They think that they ought to be entertained by preaching, but the word spoken does not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that hear it.",
