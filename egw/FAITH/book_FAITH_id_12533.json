    "word": "(2 Corinthians 4:17, 18.) An Eternal Weight of Glory.--\"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.\" Because of their faith this honor is bestowed on them. In this life they did not boast, nor lift up their souls unto vanity. With intensity of desire, with a pure, holy faith, they grasped the promise of eternal riches. Their one desire was to be like Christ. Ever they kept the standard of righteousness uplifted. To them is given an eternal weight of glory, because on the earth they walked with God, keeping themselves unspotted from the world, revealing to their fellow beings the righteousness of Christ. Of them the Saviour declares, \"They shall walk with me in white, in the world that I have prepared for them\" [Revelation 3:5 quoted] (RH Aug. 10, 1905).",
