    "word": "The salvation of God is to be revealed in the great cities of the land. Ministers often visit companies of believers in the different conferences; and this is a work that has its place; but the ministers have a solemn work to perform in the great cities. As God's people take up this responsibility and discharge it in His fear, those who are enlightened as the result of faithful labor will give freely of their means to sustain the work in their cities and in other places as well. As the laborers go to the new converts, and in the spirit and power of God ask them for help, the Spirit of God will move upon their hearts.",
