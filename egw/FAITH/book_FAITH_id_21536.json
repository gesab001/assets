    "word": "Let us increase our faith and cling close to our divine Lord, because Satan will oppose. But we should rejoice in the thought that the angels in heaven are sent to strengthen us, and we have not to fight our battles alone. And if we have these heavenly messengers with us, even if trials do come, we shall feel like Paul when he said, \"For our light affliction, which \n\n\n                                     -93- \n\nis but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\" 2 Corinthians 4:17.",
