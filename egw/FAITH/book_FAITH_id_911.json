    "word": "In vain were Satan\u2019s efforts to destroy the church of Christ by violence. The great controversy in which the disciples of Jesus yielded up their lives did not cease when these faithful standard-bearers fell at their post. By defeat they conquered. God\u2019s workmen were slain, but His work went steadily forward. The gospel continued to spread, and the number of its adherents to increase. . . . Said a Christian, expostulating with the heathen rulers who were urging forward the persecution: \u201cYou may torment, afflict, and vex us. Your wickedness puts our weakness to the test, but your cruelty is of no avail. It is but a stronger invitation to bring others to our persuasion. The more we are mowed down, the more we spring up again. The blood of the Christians is seed.\u201d",
