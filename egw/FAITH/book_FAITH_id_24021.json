    "word": "Christ was weary and faint from fasting when the denial of Peter reached Him; and while the degrading oaths were fresh upon his lips, and the shrill crowing of the cock was yet ringing in his ears, the Saviour turned His face from the frowning judges and looked full upon His poor disciple. At the same time Peter's eyes were involuntarily fixed upon his Master. He read in that gentle countenance deep pity and sorrow; but there was no anger there. That face, pale with suffering, those quivering lips, seemed to speak to Peter. \"Not know Me, Peter?\" The look was blended with pity, compassion, and forgiveness for the unfaithful one; and it pierced Peter's heart like an arrow. He fled from the now crowded courts, he cared not where. At last he found himself in the garden of Gethsemane and in the very spot where Jesus had poured out His soul in agony to His Father. He fell on his face stricken and wounded, and so overwhelmed with what he had done that he wished he could die there.",
