    "word": "Dear Sister, I have not forgotten you, although I have not written you. I have often thought of you and prayed for you and the rest of the children, that your and their faith fail not. Do not mingle with the world; keep separate from them. If you mingle with them you will surely lose strength. Seek to live near to God and to hold sweet communion with Him.--Letter 8, 1850, p. 3. (To Sister Arabella Hastings, August 4, 1850.)",
