    "word": "Cultivate Dependence on God--The faith of those who believe every word of God is accounted unto them for righteousness. We need to cultivate a trustful dependence on God, saying as did the apostle Paul, I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day. (See 2 Timothy 1:12.)--Ms. 77, 1898.",
