    "word": "The crowd pressing upon Christ had no living union with Him by genuine faith. But a poor woman who had been many years a great sufferer and had spent all her living upon physicians but was made no better, but rather worse, thought if she could get within reach of Him, if she could only touch the hem of His garment, she would be made whole.

He would use that act to distinguish the touch of genuine faith from the casual contact of those who were crowding about Him. . . .",
