    "word": "The duty of parents to the children, making them responsible, is equally to bear upon the children. Their duty to their parents is sacred and binding as long as they both shall live. When you feel that you are your own and can go and come as you please, irrespective of your father's wishes, you should not rely upon your father's purse for clothing or for food. When your responsibility ceases as a faithful, obedient son, then your father's obligation ceases. He should not do you so great an injury which will tell on your whole future life as to support you in school.--Letter 4, 1875, pp. 1-3. (To Frank Belden, January 31, 1875.) \n\n\n                                    -193-",
