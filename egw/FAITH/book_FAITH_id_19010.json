    "word": "When one is fully emptied of self, when every false god is cast out of the soul, the vacuum is supplied by the inflowing of the Spirit of Christ. Such a one has the faith which works by love and purifies the soul from every moral and spiritual defilement. The Holy Spirit, the Comforter, can work upon the heart, influencing and directing, so that he enjoys spiritual things. He is \"after the Spirit\" (Romans 8:1), and he minds the things of the Spirit. He has no confidence in self; Christ is all in all. Truth is constantly being unfolded by the Holy Spirit; he receives with meekness the engrafted word, and he gives the Lord all the glory, saying, \"God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit\" (1 Corinthians 2:10). \"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God\" (verse 12).",
