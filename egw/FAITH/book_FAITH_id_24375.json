    "word": "All the self-exaltation of man, his high estimate of himself, are not of the least value in God's sight. If man has that faith which in its simplicity works by love and sanctifies the soul, Christ says to him, Ye are a laborer \"together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" Man must be worked by God, builded by God. Material of the first quality must be used in the character building. You know that poor timbers have been put into your building. God has been working to remove these timbers. Do not build yourself after your own model. Let God make you a holy temple for Him. He has loved you. He is proving you. Make no failure. You are not to suppose that you are superior to your brethren. But God has given your every capability, your every success.",
