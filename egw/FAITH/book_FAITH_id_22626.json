    "word": "It is your privilege and duty to stand firmly in the faith. I wish you now to see that which I never meant to be made public. It will explain to you the reason of this wonderful apostasy. Brother [S. N.] Haskell, I think, has the matter in clear lines, written to Brother McCullagh after he had received a special blessing at the Cooranbong Bible Institute.

As he has poured out his tirade against me publicly, when I was not present to answer for myself, I think it just and right that his accusations shall be presented in writing, or before others, that we may be able to answer them, point by point, and thus to disappoint the enemy in his determined efforts to accuse. (See Revelation 12:10-12.)",
