    "word": "\"EVEN WHEN EXCEEDINGLY BRAIN-WEARY, YOUR MOTHER SEEMS TO FIND GREAT COMFORT IN THE PROMISES OF THE WORD, AND OFTEN CATCHES UP A QUOTATION AND COMPLETES IT WHEN WE BEGIN QUOTING SOME FAMILIAR SCRIPTURE. AT SUCH TIMES SHE SEEMS TO ME TO BE EVEN MORE SPIRITUAL-MINDED THAN USUAL; THAT IS, SHE DWELLS MORE AT LENGTH ON HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND FAITH AND HOPE, AND RECOUNTS PROVIDENCES THAT CAUSE HER TO RENEW HER COURAGE IN GOD. AT SUCH TIMES SHE ALSO REACHES OUT AFTER SPIRITUAL COMFORT AND HELP, AND ASKS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN AT OTHER TIMES THAT WE UNITE IN PRAYER WITH HER.",
