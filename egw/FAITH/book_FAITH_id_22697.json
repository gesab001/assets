There is more looking to the discouraging features, and losing faith, \n\n\n                                 -135- \n\nthan looking to the Lord, the mighty power that is waiting our demand upon its abundant resources. \"The great day of the Lord is near and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord. Even the mighty men shall cry there bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress. . . . Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath. But the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy, for He shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land\" (Zephaniah 1:14-15, 18).--Letter 12, 1896, p. 1.
