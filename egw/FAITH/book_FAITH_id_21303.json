Those who stand at the head of the work \n                                                                           264\nshould take such a course that they can unblushingly say, \"Come, let us act mutually in this work which was commenced in a sacrifice, and is supported by a continual self-denial.\" The people should not excel those who stand at the head of our institutions in practicing economy, and binding about their wants. It is those men who receive high wages who make very little offerings to the cause. Let the people who strain every nerve and muscle to lay by their tithes have a knowledge of the large wages paid to the workers in the office, and their confidence and faith will be shaken. When you call for donations, there will be no response. Ms 25a, 1891, pp. 8, 9. (Untitled Manuscript, 1891.)",
