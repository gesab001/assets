    "word": "I was here at Loma Linda when this place was purchased. As I spoke to the people, the power of God came into our midst again and again. On the occasion of my first visit to look over the property, I knelt right down with our brethren and the representatives of the owners of the place who were here, I knelt right down in the midst of them and prayed to God about the work that should be undertaken and carried forward in Loma Linda. When I got up, some of those who were not of our faith seemed to be deeply moved. From that time I have ever felt under bounden duty to God to make this place just what it should be. I know that there are men here who have wrestled in the cause of God, and I know that they have passed through an experience that they never would have had if Satan had not had the power to oppress them.",
