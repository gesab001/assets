    "word": "I wish to say that the work that is being done by Dr. Kellogg is not to be regarded as a strange work; for it is the very work that every church that believes the truth for this time, should long since have been doing. But our position as depositaries of sacred truth has been but dimly realized. If the world had before them the example that God demands those who believe in him to set, they would work the works of Christ. If Jesus were set forth, crucified among us, if we viewed the cross of Calvary in the light of God's word, we would be one with Christ as he was one with the Father. Our faith would be altogether different from the faith now shown. It would be a faith that works by love to God and to our fellow men, and purifies the soul. If this faith were shown by God's people, many more would believe on Christ. A hallowed influence would be exerted by the benevolent actions of God's servants, and they would shine as lights in the world. \n\n\n                      - 3 -",
