    "word": "The vision given to Isaiah represents the condition of God's people in the last days. . . . As they look by faith into the holy of holies, and see the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, they perceive that they are a people of unclean lips--a people whose lips have often spoken vanity and whose talents have not been sanctified and employed to the glory of God. . . . If they will humble their souls before God, there is hope for them. The bow of promise is above the throne, and the work done for Isaiah will be performed in them.",
