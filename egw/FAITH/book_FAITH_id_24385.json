    "word": "In the antediluvian world, man refused to obey. There was an extraordinary prevalence of feeling of self-importance. Sinful man, with swelling pride, continued in deeds of unrighteousness. The Lord bore long with transgressors, and in mercy gave man a probation of one hundred and twenty years. If the evil-doers repented not, they were to be swept from the face of the earth by a flood of waters. Noah and his helpers were constantly at work preparing an immense boat. Many of the believing ones kept the faith and died triumphant.",
