    "word": "\"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee. In Tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it: And I will rebuke the devourer for your sake, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.\" I need not ask, Will not God bless \n                                                                           157\nthose who are faithful? We have his pledged word. But the blessing of God is withdrawn from dishonest, covetous church members in this life. God says it, and what God says is true. Who of you claiming to be the children of God will venture to meet your delinquencies when the books shall be opened, and every man judged according to the deeds done in the body. The first point we need to settle is that we are not to look upon the property we are handling as our own with which we may do as we please. It is the Lord's, to be administered in accordance with his prescribed plans. Be faithful in giving to the Lord the specified amount he has directed you to give. Then present the great mystery of godliness, lifting up Christ, and saying, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world.",
