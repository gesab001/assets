    "word": "He who has declared that His words are spirit and life should have their faith in strong exercise that the Lord Jesus is an honored Guest in their assemblies. \"For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them\" [Matthew 18:20]. If He is there, it is to enlighten and bless. Therefore, as we assemble together, we all have a solemn sense of the presence of God, and know that the angels of God are in the assembly. The messengers of the gospel know by experience its truth, power, and excellence. It is the hours of the Sabbath that are sacred and sanctified and holy, and every true worshiper who keeps holy the Sabbath should claim the promise, \"That ye may know I am the Lord the doth sanctify you.\"",
