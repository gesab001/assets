    "word": "Again and again I am instructed to present to our churches the work that should be done for the cities. Let us encourage a spirit of consecration and earnest seeking after God in our schools and sanitariums. We need to feel the deep movings of the Spirit of God in our midst. Then humble workers will be encouraged to offer themselves in faith to the service of God. They will do this, not for the wages they receive, but out of sincere love for sinsick, suffering souls.",
