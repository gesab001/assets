    "word": "If those who have been connected with the work of God for many years would study carefully how much injury they have done the Lord's vineyard by unwise moves, by departing from right principles and diverting means from the cause of God by using their influence to lead others into crooked paths, instead of grasping for higher wages they would humble themselves before God with a repentance that needeth not to be repented of. Let them ask themselves the question,\" `How much owest thou unto my lord?' (Luke 16:5). What account shall I render for the talent misused, for following my own unsanctified imagination? What can I do to blot out the evil results of my unwise moves which have so limited the resources of the cause?\" Had every man occupied his position of trust with faithfulness, there would be no dearth of means today in the Lord's treasury.",
