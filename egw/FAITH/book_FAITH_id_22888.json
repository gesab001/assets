    "word": "May the dear Jesus reveal Himself to you as He has done to me, is my prayer. He is the One \"altogether lovely,\" and \"the chiefest among ten thousand.\" Believe, only believe. Commit the keeping of your soul unto Him as unto a faithful Creator. Jesus will forgive you, and make your character like His own pure character, if you will open the door of your heart and let Him in. He wants to give you His peace, His joy, His comfort. If you will let Him do this, He will cause you to triumph gloriously.--Letter 135, 1899, pp. 1, 9. (To J. H. Kellogg, Aug. 29, 1899.) \n\n\n                                     -309-",
