    "word": "There is great need for a building to be erected for the worship of God in some locality in Melbourne. Let everyone who loves God and professes to keep His commandments practice self-denial and walk by faith. Let them not live for mere self-pleasing, but to glorify our Redeemer. We cannot see how it is possible to advance the work, to have the truth go in decency and order, unless we arise and build. But every foot of ground costs from seven to ten pounds, and unless we have trained ourselves to walk by faith and not by sight, it will seem impossible to push forward the work of building.",
