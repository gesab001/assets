    "word": "Now I find Brother Pocock, an excellent, intelligent man, reduced by the hard times to poverty. He has a family several miles from here. Has four or five children. His wife is a very economical woman. One day when Sarah and I were out riding we went round to the sawmill on the school ground and had a talk with Brother Hare, the manager at the mill. I asked him what wages Brother Pocock was receiving per day for his work on the school land for taking out the trees. So much per tree, but he does the work so faithfully that he cannot earn much. How much, I asked, does your contract allow him? Three pence per tree. In American money this would be six cents. I asked, How much does he earn per day? Brother Hare said, About fifty cents, sometimes sixty. I asked him, Could you live and support your family on that much, Brother Hare? No, Sister White, but money is so scarce that we do not know where it is coming from. Well, said I, This will never do; pay the poor man four shillings per day, and if you cannot do that I will be responsible for it.",
