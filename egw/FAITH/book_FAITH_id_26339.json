    "word": "I ask you now to connect with the sanitarium at Loma Linda, for I cannot have you go into peril unwarned. I fear that confusion will come to you as the result of your remaining where you are. I pray that you may be led to place yourselves on the right side. I have felt deeply over your affliction, and I have seen how important it is that your faith be firmly established in a plain \"Thus saith the Lord.\" I hold you very near to my heart, and I desire that you both shall be placed where the Lord can lead you and abundantly bless you.",
