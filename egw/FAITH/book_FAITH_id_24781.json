    "word": "Here in Second Timothy, the second chapter, beginning with the eleventh verse, we read: \"It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with Him, we \n\n\n                                     -68- \n\nshall also live with Him: If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him: if we deny Him, He also will deny us: If we believe not, yet He abideth faithful; He cannot deny Himself. Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers\" [verses 11-14].",
