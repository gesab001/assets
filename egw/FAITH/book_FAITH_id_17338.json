    "word": "Be strong, and talk hope. Press your way through obstacles. You are in spiritual wedlock with Jesus Christ. The Word is your assurance. Approach your Saviour with the full assurance of faith, joining your hands with His. Follow God where He leads the way. Whatsoever He says to you, do it. He will teach you just as willingly as He will teach somebody else for you.",
