    "word": "In your present state you are doing far more harm than good; for you have a form of godliness and profess to believe \n                                                                           437\nthe truth, while your words and actions say: \"Wide is the gate, and broad is the way\" that leads to life, \"and many there be which go in thereat.\" If your life is a confession of Christ, then we may truly say that the world has gone after Him. Your profession may be right; but have you humility and love, meekness and devotion? \"Whosoever shall confess Me before men,\" by a holy life and godly conversation, \"him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God.\" No one can confess Christ unless he has the mind and spirit of Christ; he cannot communicate that which he does not possess. The daily life must be an expression of the sanctifying power of the truth, and evidence that Christ is abiding in the soul by faith. Whatever is opposed to the fruits of the Spirit, or to the work of God in separating His people from the world, is a denial of Christ; and His words are: \"He that denieth Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.\"",
