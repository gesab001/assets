    "word": "The work of the third angel's message is strengthening and broadening, and I have been instructed that the responsibilities in our large conferences should be divided, and that we should not have all our work under the supervision of one group of men. The Lord has shown me that all the means should not be centered in one place. Arrangements should be made to share the responsibilities, and wise godly men, who will act their part faithfully, should be selected to act a part in bearing responsibilities, and to be entrusted with means for their part of the field.",
