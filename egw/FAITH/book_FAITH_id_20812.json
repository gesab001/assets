    "word": "But it is not always safe to ask for unconditional healing. Let your prayer include this thought; Lord, thou knowest every secret of the soul. Thou art acquainted with these persons: for Jesus, their Advocate, gave his life for them. He loves them better than we possibly can.

In a petition of this kind no lack of faith is manifested. . . .",
