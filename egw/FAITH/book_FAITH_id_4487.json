    "word": "Those who think it impossible for them to yield to the will of God and have faith in His promises until all is made clear and plain before them, will never yield at all. Faith is not certainty of knowledge; it \"is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" (Hebrews 11:1). To obey the commandments of God is the only way to obtain His favor. \"Go forward\" should be the Christian's watchword.",
