A General Testimony. \n\n        True Sense of the Sacredness of the Work. \n\n     1. In regard to matters at the Pacific Publishing House, there has not been that faithfulness which God requires. There should be a deeper sense of the sacredness of the work, and each and all should be faithful in their several departments of the work. But there is a great lack of stability with some. When special attentions are shown by young men to the young ladies, and they in turn encourage these attentions, and the company of young men, involving neglect of duties, becoming frivolous and unguarded in deportment, it is wrong to encourage such a course of conduct by retaining them in the office in connection with the work; and when marriages occur no display should be countenanced.",
