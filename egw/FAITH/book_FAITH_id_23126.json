    "word": "My brother, your part is to cleave to the Lord. Do not be afraid to acknowledge His goodness and His love. Give to Him all the praise and glory. Remember that in these days of peril and unbelief and skepticism your safety depends on believing in and trusting Christ as a personal Saviour. The experience you are to gain is to strengthen you in the faith. You have had a decided experience. You gave yourself to the Lord to be led and guided by Him. Cleave to Christ as a personal Saviour. Hold fast the beginning of your confidence firm unto the end. With the dear family who believes with you, live for God and you will all win a crown of immortal life. Never lose eternity out of your reckoning, and trust the Lord implicitly.",
