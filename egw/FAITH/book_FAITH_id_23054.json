    "word": "Come to the Lord just as you are. Cast your helpless soul and body upon the mercy and care of the tender Shepherd; and believe, believe, believe. You will indeed see the salvation of God. Let your trust in God be unwavering. Present the promise, and then rely upon the Word that says, \"Ask, and ye shall receive.\" Read the fifth chapter of James, and follow the directions as best you can, and if it is for the Lord's glory He will raise you up. But act your part faithfully, and cling to the mighty One.",
