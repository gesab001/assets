    "word": "\"Come,\" says Jesus. \"Come,\" says Christ your Saviour, \"learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" His arm is extended, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" He has told you where to go. \"Come unto Me,\" every one of you, \"and I will give you rest.\" Do you believe it? Do we believe the word of God today? Do we believe just what He tells us? What is the matter with us, that we do not have more freedom, and that Christ is not glorified in us? It is because we don't believe Him. Every soul will act out all the faith that he has.",
