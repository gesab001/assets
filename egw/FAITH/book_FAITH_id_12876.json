    "word": "Everything that God could do, He has done to manifest His great love and mercy to you. He \"so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Then rest in the assurance of the love of God. . . . Not because we first loved Him did God love us; but \"while we were yet sinners,\" Christ died for us, making full and abundant provision for our redemption. Although by our disobedience we have merited God's displeasure and condemnation, yet He has not forsaken us, leaving us to grapple with the power of the enemy in our own finite strength. Heavenly angels fight our battles for us, and cooperating with them, we may be victorious over the powers of evil. . . . As we draw nigh to Him by faith, He draws nigh to us, adopting us into His family, and making us His sons and daughters.",
