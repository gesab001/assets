    "word": "Here the apostle has given us the fruits of pure and undefiled religion. The fruits of that wisdom that descendeth not from above are also distinctly presented. Will you, my dear brethren and sisters, consider these fruits, so opposite in character and tendencies, and determine which spirit you are cherishing? May the Lord open the eyes of our people to see clearly on which side they stand. The good fruits are without partiality and without hypocrisy. \n\n\n                                   -179- \n\nWhen the grace of Christ dwells in the heart, there are words and deeds of kindness, tender compassion for one another, not merely for a few who extol and favor you. The harvest of peace is sown in peace of them that make peace. Christ knows the spirit we cherish. The faithful Witness says, \"I know thy works.\" The thoughts of the heart are not hid from Him. And by our words and deeds we shall be judged in the last great day.",
