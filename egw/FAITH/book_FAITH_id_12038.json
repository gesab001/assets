    "word": "Congregation Rises to Feet for Consecration Prayer.--I invited all who wanted to give themselves to God in a sacred covenant, and to serve Him with their whole hearts, to rise to their feet. The house was full, and nearly all rose. Quite a number not of our faith were present, and some of these arose. I presented them to the Lord in earnest prayer, and we know that we had the manifestation of the Spirit of God. We felt that a victory had indeed been gained.--Manuscript 30a, 1896. (Published in Selected Messages, book 1, p. 150.)",
