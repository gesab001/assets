    "word": "The Spirit is constantly showing to the soul glimpses of the things of God. A Divine Presence seems to hover near, and then if the mind responds, if the door of the heart is opened, Jesus abides with the human agent. The Spirit's energy is working in the heart and leading the inclination of the will to Jesus by living faith and complete dependence of Divine power to will and to do of His good pleasure. The Spirit taketh the things of God, just as fast as the soul resolves and acts in accordance with the light revealed.--Letter 135, 1898, pp. 2, 3. (To G. B. Starr, no date.)",
