    "word": "Christ's words, so comforting and cheering to those that listened to them, are for us today. As a faithful shepherd knows and cares for his sheep, so Christ cares for His children. He knows the trials and difficulties surrounding each one. \"He shall feed his flock like a shepherd,\" declares Isaiah: \"he shall gather the lambs with his arms, and carry them in his bosom.\" Christ knows His sheep intimately, and the suffering and helpless are objects of His special care. . . .",
