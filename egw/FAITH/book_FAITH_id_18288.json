    "word": "Upon your faithfulness in this work not only the well-being of others but your own eternal destiny depends. Christ is seeking to uplift all who will be lifted to companionship with Himself, that we may be one with Him as He is one with the Father. He permits us to come in contact with suffering and calamity in order to call us out of our selfishness; He seeks to develop in us the attributes of His character\u2014compassion, tenderness, and love. By accepting this work of ministry we place ourselves in His school, to be fitted for the courts of God.\u2014Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, pp. 387-389.",
