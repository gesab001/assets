    "word": "I wish that all our people could see the many doors that are open before them. Beside all waters we are to sow the seeds of truth. O, how my soul is drawn out for sinners, that they may be won to Christ! If those who have received the truth would exercise a living faith in Christ, if they would realize that they are to be His workers, wholly consecrated to His service, what a work might be done! When God's people surrender themselves unreservedly to Christ, they will use every power of mind and body to His name's glory; and His work will make rapid advancement.",
