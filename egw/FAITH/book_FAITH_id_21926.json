    "word": "The Battles With Self. Every missionary will have hard battles to fight with self, and these combats will not become fewer, but if we are constantly growing in Christian experience, if we continue to look to Jesus in faith, strength will be given us for every emergency. All the powers and faculties of a regenerated nature must be brought into constant, daily exercise. Every day we shall have occasion to crucify self, to war against inclination and a perverse temperament that would draw the will in a wrong direction. The repose and triumph of victory are not yet ours, except as we by faith enter into the victory that Christ has gained for us.--Manuscript 14, 1892, p. 2. (\"Counsel to a Minister's Wife,\" September 19, 1892.)",
