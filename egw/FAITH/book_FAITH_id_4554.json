    "word": "True faith is that which receives Christ as a personal Saviour. God gave His only-begotten Son, that I, by believing in Him, \"should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). When I come to Christ, according to His word, I am to believe that I receive His saving grace. The life that I now live, I am to \"live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me\" (Galatians 2:20).",
