    "word": "In view of the abundant evidence God has given of His love, His sympathy, and His benevolence, He requires our willing obedience. His love will prove a safeguard to every soul. It will bar the path to sin and selfish indulgence.

To the true follower of Christ there is a pleasure in doing the things that Christ has done in his behalf. He considers it not an arbitrary exaction, but a clear specification of his only safety from the advances of the wily foe who is ever seeking to entangle our feet and make our path difficult.",
