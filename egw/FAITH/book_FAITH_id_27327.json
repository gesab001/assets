    "word": "I shall believe that you will begin work on that sanitarium very soon, and every stroke must be a stroke of faith. Press the battle to the gate; do not be discouraged. Move just as far as you can go. Make every preparation as if you know that building was going up. Mark out your ground, and get every jot and inch of advance possible. The Lord knows you need that sanitarium. Can not you make something with \"Object Lessons?\" We will hold up your hands, and prayer will reach the throne of grace. Trust in the Lord's power; trust, and lean your whole weight upon the Lord Jesus, and the salvation of God will be revealed.",
