    "word": "God will not vindicate any who, in associating with opposers to our faith or with our own brethren, manifest toward them a harsh, denunciatory spirit. Those who do this may appear to have a zeal for the truth, but it is not according to knowledge. To be unkind and denunciatory, and to entertain evil thoughts and harsh, severe judgments, is never the fruit of that wisdom which is from above, but it is the sure fruit of an unsanctified ambition, such as caused the condemnation of Jesus.",
