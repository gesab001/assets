    "word": "Suitable Sites for Schools in Rural Areas--We are looking for places on which to establish industrial schools. In charge of these schools we shall place carefully chosen teachers who will teach the children and youth to use their capabilities in a way that will make them of use in the Lord's work. I am urging our people to establish our schools away from the congested cities, and to place in these schools faithful, consecrated teachers who will make the Word of God the beginning and end of all the education given.--Letter 143, 1902, p. 3. (To Mrs. Mary Foss, Sept. 12, 1902.)",
