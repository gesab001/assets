    "word": "At this time when God's people should be bearing a plain, clear message, filled with earnestness and power, many who have been appointed to preach the truth are departing from the faith. The enemy with his evil angels has come down in great power, bringing in delusions and false theories. He is working with all deceivableness of unrighteousness that he may, if possible, \"deceive the very elect.\" Our people are in danger of being drawn away from the important, definite truths for this time. A message of Bible truth is called for today, and should come from hearts imbued with the Holy Spirit, and lips that have been touched with live coals from the divine altar. \n                                                                           57",
