    "word": "My sister, it is our safety to keep Christ uplifted as the author and finisher of our faith, and then follow His example to do His will, irrespective of consequences. If there is first a willing mind, there will be no lack of light and help from the source of all power. The Lord will lead every one who will place his hand in His. He never lets go the hand of any one, unless it is withdrawn.",
