    "word": "The pardon of sin, justification by faith in Jesus Christ, access to God only through a Mediator because of their lost condition, their guilt and sin--of these truths the people had little conception. In a great measure they had lost the knowledge of God and of the only way to approach Him. They had lost nearly all genuine sense of what constitutes sin, and of what constitutes righteousness. The pardon of sins through Jesus Christ, the coming Messiah whom their sacrificial offerings represented, was dimly understood by all, and had become entirely extinct in the minds of many.-- Manuscript 58, 1900, pp. 4-7. (\"The Law and the Gospel,\" August 14, 1900.)",
