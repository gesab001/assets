    "word": "The apostle James, inspired by Jesus Christ, lays down our duty in clear lines. \"Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.\" We are Christ's witnesses, Christ's representatives. In his epistle to Titus, Paul charges him to set in order things that are wanting in the church. \"Speak thou the things which become sound doctrine,\" he says. The teacher of truth is to educate all, both old and young. He is to exhort aged men to be \"sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.\" When those who profess to be servants of Christ do not walk circumspectly, God is dishonored and the truth is reproached.",
