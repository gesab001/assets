    "word": "With His life Christ has purchased every human being. He died a cruel death to save human beings from eternal death. He gave His sinless life to obtain for the sinner a life that measures with the life of God. Through His death He provided a way whereby man may break with Satan, return to his allegiance to God, and through faith in the Redeemer obtain pardon. Oh, how wicked, how ungrateful are those who refuse to accept the mercy that at such infinite cost is offered them!",
