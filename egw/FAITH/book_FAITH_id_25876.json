    "word": "My brother, this objecting to the passing of a law to bring the Bible into the schools will work against us, those of our faith who are making so much of the Bible. A year ago there was something presented before me in reference to these things, and we shall have to use the Bible for our evidence to show the foundation of our faith. We shall be exceedingly cautious in every particular lest we shut out a single ray of light from those who are in darkness. I remember particularly this point 'That anything that should give the knowledge of God, and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent, should not be obstructed at all.' Some things I can not present in distinct lines, but enough is clear to me that I want you to be very careful on what ground you tread, for our enemies will make a decided argument against us if we shall give them a semblance of a chance. I think the law-making powers will carry their point in this particular, if not now, a short period ahead. And it is very essential, as a people, we take the greatest care that no provocation be given our enemies which they will make capital of against us as a people, in a future crisis, in the matter of opposing so good a work as the introduction of the Bible into the public schools.",
