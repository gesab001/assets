After the patient has committed his will to the will of God, let him trust, drawing nigh to the great Physician, the Mighty Healer, and giving himself up in perfect trust.

Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength\" (Isaiah 26:3, 4). Ms. 67, 1899, pp. 6,7. (Untitled manuscript, April 25, 1899.)",
