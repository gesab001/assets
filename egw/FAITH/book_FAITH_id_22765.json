    "word": "God has been speaking to us through His Word, through His testimonies, pointing out our errors and showing us the right way. I do not give you up. You must come to the light. You must cast off the works of darkness and put on the whole armor of righteousness. The forgiveness of sin is promised to him who repents; justification to him who believes, the crown of life to him who is faithful to the end. The condition of our receiving an increase of grace is that we improve that which we already have. You are called upon by the voice of God to keep yourself unspotted from the world if you would stand without spot and blameless before the Judge of the whole earth.--Ms 12, 1888, pp. 1,3,4,6,7.
