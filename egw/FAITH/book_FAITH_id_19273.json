    "word": "The labor of love springs from the work of faith. Bible religion means constant work. \"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" \"Work \n\n\n                       - 37 - \n\nout your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\" We are to be \"zealous of good works;\" \"be careful to maintain good works.\" And the True Witness says, \"I know thy works.\" While it is true that our busy activities will not in themselves insure salvation, it is also true that faith which unites us to Christ will stir the soul to activity.",
