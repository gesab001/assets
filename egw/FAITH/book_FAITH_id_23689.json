    "word": "A few forcible remarks upon some point of doctrine will fasten in the mind much more firmly than to bring in a mass of matter where nothing lies out clear and distinct in the mind of those ignorant of our faith.

The self-denial and the sufferings of Christ should be brought into our labors, and the great love wherewith He has loved us appear in all our efforts.",
