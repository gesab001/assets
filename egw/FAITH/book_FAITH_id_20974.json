    "word": "Many are in danger of thinking that in the cares of labor, in writing and practicing as physicians, or performing the duties of the various departments, they are excusable if they lay down prayer, neglect the Sabbath, and neglect religious service. Sacred things are thus brought down to meet their convenience, while duties, denials, and crosses are left untouched. Neither physicians nor helpers should attempt to perform their work without taking time to pray. God would be the helper of all who profess to love him, if they would come to him in faith, and, with a sense of their own weakness, crave his power. When they separate from God, their wisdom will be found to be foolishness. When they are small in their own eyes, and lean heavily upon their God, then he will be the arm of their power, and success will attend their efforts; but when they \n                                                                           37\nallow the mind to be diverted from God, then Satan comes in and controls the thoughts and perverts the judgment.",
