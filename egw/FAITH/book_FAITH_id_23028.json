    "word": "Now these white-robed ones are gathered within the fold of the great Shepherd. The faithful instrument and souls saved by his labors are greeted by the Lamb which is seated in the midst of the throne, and led to the tree of life and to the fountain of living waters. With what joy does he behold these redeemed ones, who are made sharers of the Redeemer's throne! How much more precious is heaven to those who have been faithful in the work of saving others. \"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.\"",
