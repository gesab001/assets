    "word": "The Laodicean message has been sounding. Take this message in all its phases and sound it forth to the people wherever Providence opens the way. Justification by faith and the righteousness of Christ are the themes to be presented to a perishing world. Oh, that you may open the door of your heart to Jesus! The voice of Jesus, the great vendor of heavenly treasures, is calling to you, \"I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed.\" But I will write no more. My heart is drawn out in love toward you, and my desire is that you shall triumph with the third angel's message.--Letter 24, 1892. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. September 5, 1985. Entire letter.",
