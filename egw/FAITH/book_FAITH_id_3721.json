    "word": "Full Credit to Associate Workers.--Each is to act his part faithfully, and each is to give credit to his brother worker for the part which he performs. Let not your conversation be covetous, taking credit to self. God has used many instrumentalities in His work. That which you have done is only a part of that work. Others have worked diligently and prayerfully and intelligently and they must not be overlooked. \"His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.\" In the day of final reckoning God will justly reckon with His servants, and He will give to every man according as his works have been. God has marked the lives of the self-denying, self-sacrificing workers who have carried the work in difficult fields.",
