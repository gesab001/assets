    "word": "Chap. 58 - A Speedy Preparation for Work\n\n     The practice of furnishing a few students with every advantage for perfecting their education in so many lines that it would be impossible for them to make use of them all is an injury rather than a benefit to the one who has so many advantages, and it deprives others of the privileges that they need so much. If there were far less of this long-continued preparation, far less exclusive devotion to study, there would be much more opportunity for an increase of the student's faith in God. . . . It has been shown me that some of the students are losing their spirituality, that their faith is becoming weak, and that they do not hold constant communion with God. They spend nearly all their time in the perusal of books; they seem to know but little else. But what advantage will all this preparation be to them? What benefit will they derive for all the time and money spent? I tell you, it will be worse than lost. . . .",
