    "word": "With these words of light and truth before them, how dare men neglect so plain a duty? How dare they disobey God when obedience to his requirements means prosperity in temporal and spiritual things, and disobedience means the curse of God? Satan is the destroyer. God cannot bless those who refuse to be faithful stewards. All he can do is to permit Satan to do his destroying work. We see calamities of every shape and in every degree coming upon the earth; and why? -- The Lord's restraining power is not exercised. The world has disregarded the word of God. They live as though there were no God. \n\n\n                     - 73 - \n\nLike the inhabitants of the Noachic world, they refuse to have any thought of God. Wickedness prevails to an alarming extent, and the earth is ripe for the harvest.",
