    "word": "Christ died for them that they might have life. He opened before them the way whereby they might, through His merits, keep the law of God. Christ says, \"I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it\" (Revelation 3:8). How hard men work to close that door; but they are not able. John's testimony is, \"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament\" (Revelation 11:19). Beneath the mercy seat, within the ark, were the two tables of stone, containing the law of Jehovah. God's faithful ones saw the light that shone forth to them from the law, to be given to the world. And now Satan's intense activity is to close that door of light; but Jesus says that no man can shut it. Men will turn from the light, denounce it, and despise it, but it still shines forth in clear, distinct rays to cheer and bless all who will see it.",
