    "word": "I warn Arabella and the rest of the children to prepare to meet Jesus, and then they will meet their mother again, nevermore to be parted. Oh, children, will you heed her faithful warning that she gave you while she was with you, and let not all her prayers that she has offered up to God for you be as water spilt upon the ground. Get ready to meet Jesus, and all will be well. Give your hearts to God and do not rest a day unless you know that you love Jesus.",
