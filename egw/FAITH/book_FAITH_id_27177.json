    "word": "Edson White and others have been crowded in most disagreeable positions. They have been forced to the wall. God has seen this unjust dealing. Wherein did those who took part in this unrighteousness love God supremely and their neighbor as themselves? \"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, if ye have not shown wisdom in using what was another's, who shall give you that which is your own?\" This strikes to the very root of the matter. Unjust, unholy actions have brought the frown of God upon the Review and Herald Office. Evil work has brought the cause of God into disrepute, and has kept the backsliders from obeying his holy law.",
