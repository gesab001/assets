    "word": "Abraham's Great Test \n\n     When God bade Abraham to leave his country and friends, he might have reasoned and questioned the purposes of God in this. But he showed that he had perfect confidence that God was leading him; he did not question whether it was a fertile, pleasant country, or whether or not he should have ease. He went at God's bidding. This is a lesson to every one of us. When duty seems to lead us contrary to our inclinations, we are to have faith in God. . . .",
