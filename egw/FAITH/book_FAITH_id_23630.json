    "word": "These words were written to a youth. Paul tells Timothy that he is not to be a weakling, but strong in the grace of God; that it is his privilege to have power and grace. Timothy is to show that he has given attention to the things which have been communicated to him by his father in the gospel. He is to treasure up those truths and commit them to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. This was his charge. His special work was to gather up the fragments of all he had heard, and commit them to others.",
