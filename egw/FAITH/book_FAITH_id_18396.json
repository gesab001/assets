    "word": "The sincere Christian, in his [acceptance] of grace, feels that his success is wholly dependent upon Christ. Here is the Source of divine energy. He urges no claim founded on his own merit; he has no faithfulness to present to heaven. He feels his own weakness and inefficiency, and is convinced that he must be transformed in character. Self-abasement, and self-renunciation reveal that the soul has beheld Jesus. The heart made penitent by the Spirit of Christ will act from principle. He is a partaker of the divine nature. . . . In his daily walk and conversation he represents the character of Christ. . . .",
