    "word": "Washington, D.C., Tuesday, December 23, 1890 \n\n     Tuesday morning I rose at four a.m., and after a season of prayer I felt comforted and encouraged and try to put my trust fully in the Lord. I rest in His promises. I shall see of His salvation. I will not distrust my heavenly Father, for He has been true and faithful in all things and He will never fail those who put their trust in Him. My greatest anxiety is lest something shall interpose between me and my God.",
