    "word": "The Lord calls for faithfulness in service. He desires servants who will be diligent to help those in error. The day of the Lord is right upon us. . . . Let not one stumbling block be laid before those who are seeking to know the will of the Lord. Do not make public the supposed errors you see in those who profess to believe the truth. What you have to say, say to them alone, with hearts filled with pity and tenderness. . . .",
