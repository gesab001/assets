    "word": "God calls upon his faithful watchmen who see the danger, to lift up the cry, \"The morning cometh, and also the night.\" It is the work of every soul who understands Bible truth for this time, to unite his voice with the messengers in proclaiming the message, in pushing the triumphs of the cross. The truth must be presented in its simplicity, and laid out in clear lines. We are in no case to hide our light under a bushel, as if ashamed of it. We have nothing of which to be ashamed; the commandments of God are to be honored above the traditions and commandments of men.",
