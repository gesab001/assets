    "word": "Whoever under the reproof of God will humble the soul with confession and repentance, as did David, may be sure that there is hope for him or her. Whoever will in faith accept God\u2019s promises will find pardon. The Lord will never cast away one truly repentant soul. He has given this promise: \u201cLet him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me\u201d (Isaiah 27:5). \u201cLet the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon\u201d (Isaiah 55:7).\u2014Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 726.",
