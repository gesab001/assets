    "word": "Said Jesus to His believing disciples, \"Abide in Me.\" This means continual faith on the part of the believer. \"Abide in Me.\" This means, listen to the instruction of Christ. We must do His will. Christ makes us at home with Him, and we enjoy the favors of His home, enjoy His peace. All human frictions, all ill-temper, all irritation cease in His home.",
