    "word": "We do not earn salvation by our obedience, for salvation is the free gift of God, to be received by faith. But obedience is the fruit of faith. \"Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not\" (chap. 3:5, 6). Here is the true test. If we abide in Christ, if the love of God dwells in us, our feelings, our thoughts, our purposes, our actions, will be in harmony with the will of God as expressed in the precepts of His holy law. \"Little children, let no man deceive you; he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous\" (verse 7). Righteousness is defined by the standard of God's holy law, as expressed in the ten precepts given on Sinai.",
