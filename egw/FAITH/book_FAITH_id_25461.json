    "word": "We had an excellent meeting. The presence of the Lord was with us. He breathed upon me His Holy Spirit and gave me the spirit of earnest supplication to God that I might be imbued with His Holy Spirit in all my labors, and that my ministering brethren might be endowed with power from on high to carry the solemn message to all parts of the world. I bore a decided testimony to the people assembled, and there were precious testimonies that followed. All related their experience the past year as being of a more spiritual character than they have had before since embracing the truth. The light of justification through faith, and that the righteousness of Christ must become our righteousness, else we cannot possibly keep the law of God, is the testimony of all who speak, and the fruit is peace, courage, joy, and harmony. There is danger of making even these subjects a theory, and not practicing the truth that is expressed. Those who bear this message must carry with them the pure character of Christ Jesus.",
