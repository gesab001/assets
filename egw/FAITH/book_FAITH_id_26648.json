Abraham is called the father of the faithful. \"I know him,\" said the Searcher of hearts, \"that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\" The Lord chose Abraham as a representative man, because He knew that he would cultivate home religion, that he would cause the fear of the Lord to circulate through his tent. There would be no betrayal of sacred trust on Abraham's part. He would acknowledge and keep God's law. Blind affection and indulgence, which is the veriest cruelty, would not be shown by him. By the combined influence of authority and affection he would rule his house. Mercy and justice were blended in his rule.",
