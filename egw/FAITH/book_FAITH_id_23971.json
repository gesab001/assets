    "word": "Means Will Come in \"If We Walk With God\" \n\n     The Lord has revealed to me that if we walk with God, depending upon Him in faith, He will open the hearts of wealthy men who have never professed religion, and they will give us of their means to use as we choose. They will not give on condition that we shall be amenable to them in any way, but will give without making restrictions. They will be convinced that the power of God is with us, and will make these gifts voluntarily.",
