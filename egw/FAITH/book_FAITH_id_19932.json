    "word": "At the camp-meetings workers are gathered from all parts of the field, and it seems a favourable opportunity for considering business matters connected with the various branches of the work, and for the training of workers in different lines. All these different interests are important, but when they have been attended to at a camp-meeting, \n\n\n                     - 15 - \n\nonly a small margin of time and effort remains in which to treat of the practical relation of truth to the soul. Ministers are diverted from their work of building up the children of God in the most holy faith, and the camp-meeting does not meet the end for which it was appointed. Many meetings are conducted in which the larger number of the people have little interest, and if they could attend them all, they would go away wearied instead of being refreshed and benefitted. Many are thus disappointed at the failure of their expectation to receive help from the camp-meeting. Those who came for enlightenment and strength return to their homes little better fitted to work in their families and churches than before attending the meeting.",
