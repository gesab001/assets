    "word": "I ask you, do you in this early morning hour recognize Christ? He does not want us to be as a band of mourners moving in a funeral train, bearing upon us the marks of care and perplexity and hopelessness. He wants us to commit the keeping of our souls to Him. He wants us to put our trust in the naked promise. But, you say, I do not feel like it. Tell me what value there is in feeling, if it keeps you away from your only Helper and you turn to erring mortals for help. Is feeling stronger than the faith which it is your privilege to exercise in God? Feelings change with almost every circumstance; but the promises of the Eternal are as solid rock. Let us build our house upon the sure foundation, and rivet our souls to the eternal Rock, the Rock of Ages. If we do this we shall find that it will become habitual for us to remember that we have a Companion. Wherever we are, we are to talk with God. This is the way Enoch walked with God. He talked with Him. He recognized the divine Presence. And in the days of Enoch the world was no more favorable for the perfection of Christian character than in 1901.",
