    "word": "Constantly the Pharisees tried to lead Christ away from the principles of God's government. Making a great profession of piety, they sought to lead Him to swerve from His allegiance.

This deviation from the holy principles of heaven has placed them in the ranks of the great deceiver. . . .",
