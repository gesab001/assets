    "word": "How stands the record in the book of God in regard to your dealing in financial matters? \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\" Christ declares that a selfish use of our possessions in this world proves us unfaithful to God, and therefore disqualified for the higher, heavenly trusts. We are not to live an inactive life in heaven. The faithful steward will there be intrusted with much. \"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who shall commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?\" Christ has purchased us by the price of his own blood; he has paid the purchase money for our redemption; and if we will lay hold upon the treasure, it is ours by the free gift of the Son of God. In this probationary time we may show ourselves unworthy to have the heavenly gift intrusted to our keeping. Money is not ours; houses and grounds, \n\n\n                        [67] \n\npictures and furniture, garments and luxuries, do not belong to us. We are pilgrims, we are strangers. We have only a grant of those things that are necessary for health and life. But Satan places the temptation before us to desire many things with which the children of light should have nothing to do. Our temporal blessings are given us in trust, to prove whether we can be trusted with eternal riches. If we stand the proving of God, then we shall receive that purchased possession which is to be our own,--glory, honor, and immortality.",
