    "word": "Oh, that all could see this and embrace the message given them of God! He has raised up His servants to present truth that, because it involves lifting the cross, has been lost sight of, and is buried beneath the rubbish of formality. It must be rescued and be reset in the framework of present truth. Its claims must be asserted, and its position given it in the third angel's message. Let the many ministers of Christ sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, and seek God while He is to be found. Call upon Him while you are now lying at the foot of the cross of Calvary. Divest yourselves of all pride and as representative guardians of the churches, weep between the porch and the altar, and cry \"Spare Thy people, Lord, and give not Thine heritage to reproach. Take from us what Thou wilt, but withhold not Thy Holy \n\n\n                                    -278- \n\nSpirit from us, Thy people.\" Pray, oh, pray for the outpouring of the Spirit of God!--Ms 27, 1889. (\"The Need of a New Concept of Righteousness by Faith,\" September 13, 1889.) \n\nReleased March 17, 1878.",
