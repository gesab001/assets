W. Prescott Takoma Park \n\n\n     Dear Brother: I am instructed to say to you, Let there be no questions agitated at this time in the Review that will tend to unsettle minds. Let us seek for soul work. Let us as a people humble ourselves before the Lord, and seek Him for true conversion. There is a work to be done in our hearts and in our homes that but few understand. There is need of much praying, not need of long prayers, but prayers of faith offered in humility of soul.",
