    "word": "MR No. 439 - Steadfastness in Time of Apostasy\n\n     There is to be no dread of anyone being borne down even in a wide spread apostasy, who has a living experience in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. If Jesus be formed within, the hope of glory, the illiterate as well as the educated can bear the testimony of our faith, saying, \"I know in whom I have believed.\" Some will not, in argument, be able to show wherein their adversary is wrong, having never had any advantages that others have had, yet these are not overborne by the apostasy because they have the evidence in their own heart that they have the truth, and the most subtle reasoning and assaults of Satan cannot move them from their knowledge of the truth, and they have not a doubt or fear that they are themselves in error.--Ms 6, 1889, p. 24. (Untitled, November 4, 1889.) \n\nReleased June 18, 1975.",
