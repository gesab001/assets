    "word": "The sum and substance of the whole matter of Christian growth and experience is comprised in believing on Christ,-- in knowing God, and his Son, whom he hath sent. But here is where many fail; for they lack faith in God. Instead of desiring to be brought into fellowship with Christ in his self-denial and humiliation, they are ever seeking for the supremacy of self. As long as they refuse to fall upon the Rock and be broken, they cannot appreciate the love or the character of God. We may be one with Christ; but we must be willing to yield our own way, our own will, and have the mind that was in Christ, that we may know what it is to have fellowship with him in humiliation and suffering. Our ideas are too contracted; we must have more expanded views of Christ and the character of his work. O, if we did but appreciate the love of God, how would our hearts be enlarged our limited sympathies expanded, till they would break from the icy barriers of selfishness; and our comprehension would be deeper than it now is, for we should look beneath the surface. \n                                                                           20",
