    "word": "You should preserve a true Christian dignity, \n                                                                           47\nbut avoid all affectation. Be strictly honest in heart and life. Let faith, like the palm-tree, strike its penetrating roots beneath the things which do appear, and bring up spiritual refreshment from the living springs of God's grace and mercy. There is a well of water which springeth up into everlasting life. You must draw your life from this hidden spring. If you divest yourselves of selfishness, and strengthen your souls by constant communion with God, you may promote the happiness of all with whom you come in contact. You will notice the neglected, inform the ignorant, encourage the oppressed and desponding, and, as far as possible, relieve the suffering. And you will not only point the way to Heaven, but will walk in that way yourselves.",
