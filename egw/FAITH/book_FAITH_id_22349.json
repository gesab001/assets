    "word": "The man Pomare has been baptized and has gone to America to become a medical missionary. He had a very hard time of it to get off from his people. The case was watched with deep interest. He is the son of a chief of high repute. The lad who wants to go to Melbourne is the son of an eminent chieftain of the tribe, who is a member of the legislature in Wellington. His father gave his consent, also his grandfather--who is holding the money belonging to the young man--but some of the bitterest opposers to our faith wrote to the father and grandfather a representation of our people and they took back their consent and would not let him go. But he told them he should go, and he wrote to Sister Caro for the money and if she could not let him have it to solicit Sister White to loan it to him.",
