    "word": "The instruction I have for our physicians is that they must study the word of God with earnestness and diligence. God says, \"Come out, . . . and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the unclean.\" 2 Corinthians 6:17. Obey this word, at whatever cost to social position, worldly honor, or earthly wealth. Trust in the Lord. Walk in all humility of mind before Him. Holding by faith to His word, you may go forward.",
