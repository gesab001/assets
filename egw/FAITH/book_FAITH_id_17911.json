    "word": "Advancement in true education does not harmonize with selfishness. True knowledge comes from God, and returns again to God. His children are to receive that they may give again. Those who through the grace of God have received intellectual and spiritual benefits are, as they advance, to draw others with them to a higher excellence. And this work, done to promote the good of others, will have the cooperation of unseen agencies. As we faithfully continue the work, we shall have high aspirations for righteousness, holiness, and a perfect knowledge of God. We ourselves will become complete in Christ in this life, and will take with us to the courts above our increased capabilities, there to continue our higher education.--Manuscript 108, Sept. 1, 1898, \"Higher Education.\"",
