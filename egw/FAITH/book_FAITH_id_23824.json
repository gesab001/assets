    "word": "Christ came to this earth and suffered the sorrows, disappointments, and griefs of humanity, that man might stand on vantage ground before angels and before men, revealing to the world the attributes of God. Let us put self out of sight, and think more of Christ. People are longing to hear of the Saviour from those who have learned of Him His meekness and His lowliness, and who can therefore speak words of sincere experience. Such ones inspire faith and confidence. They show no coarseness of speech, no carelessness of attitude; for they realize that they are representatives of Christ.",
