    "word": "Many of the Jewish people will by faith receive Christ as their Redeemer. To them the words will be fulfilled, \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\" They will be changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. They will be made partakers of the divine nature. The image of divinity will be stamped on their souls. If they will continue to learn of Christ, they will attain to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.",
