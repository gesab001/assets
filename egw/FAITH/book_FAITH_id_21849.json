    "word": "Let no one imagine that it is an easy thing to overcome the enemy, and through faith and perfect obedience gain eternal life. Not one can be borne aloft to an incorruptible inheritance without effort on his part. To look back is to grow dizzy, to let go is to perish. Few appreciate the importance of striving constantly to overcome. They relax their diligence, and as the result become selfish and self-indulgent, spiritual vigilance is not thought to be essential. Earnestness in human effort is not brought into the Christian life.--Letter 53, 1887, p. 9. (To \"Dear Brethren and Sisters Who Shall Attend the April Meeting at Oakland, California,\" undated.) \n\nReleased January 20, 1972.",
