    "word": "The word of the Lord has guided our steps since the passing of the time in 1844. We have searched the Scriptures; we have built solidly; and we have not had to tear up our foundations and put in new timbers. There is always safety in presenting a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" We must put our trust in a \"Thus saith the Lord\" and be well established in the faith.--Letter 24, 1907, p. 3. (To A. G. Daniells, Feb. 4, 1907.)",
