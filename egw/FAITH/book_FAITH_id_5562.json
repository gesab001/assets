Although church and State will unite their power to compel \u201call, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\u201d to receive \u201cthe mark of the beast,\u201d [Revelation 13:16.] yet the people of God will not receive it. The prophet of Patmos beholds \u201cthem that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God,\u201d and singing the song of Moses and the Lamb. [Revelation 15:2, 3.]",
