    "word": "MR No. 230 - Women's Dress\n\n     God Himself is taking care of you. \"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these\" [Matthew 6:29]. He has been telling about raiment. Now that God that puts the tints and the color upon all these things, can He not provide for us suitable clothing and comfortable clothing, neat and warm clothing? We need not practice extravagance. There are other ways for our clothing than that. Now He says, \"Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?\" Well now, why not trust Him who made the beautiful lilies of the valley?",
