    "word": "I have just come from the hall where the little company assemble to worship on the Sabbath. There were about eighty present. I spoke from John 14:15: \"If ye love Me, keep My commandments.\" I had much freedom in speaking, then we had a social meeting and thirty-eight testimonies were borne. The older members did not take the time, but gave opportunity for those who had more recently come to the faith. I was much pleased to see the readiness to bear testimony and to see and feel the good spirit which prevailed. It was indeed a precious season to all our souls. I was just as sure that the presence of Jesus was with us as if I could see Him in person. The Lord blessed His people. There is a goodly number of intelligent, noble-minded souls who have embraced the truth and are made to feel what it means to deny self and lift the cross and follow Jesus.",
