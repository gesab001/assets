    "word": "Let none mourn that they have not larger talents to use for the Master. . . . Go to work with steady patience and do your very best, irrespective of what others are doing. \"Every one of us shall give account of himself to God\" (Romans 14:12). Let not your thought or your words be, \"O that I had a larger work! O that I were in this or that position!\" Do your duty where you are. Make the best investments possible with your entrusted gift in the very place where your work will count the most before God. . . . Be not envious of the talents of others, for that will not increase your ability to do a good or a great work. Use your gift in meekness, in humility, in trusting faith, and wait till the day of reckoning, and you will have no cause for grief or shame. . . .",
