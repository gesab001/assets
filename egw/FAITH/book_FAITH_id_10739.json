    "word": "There is a variety of minds, and all need more or less cultivation and training. Every moment in connection with the cause of God should be characterized by caution and decision. Without decision, an individual is fickle and unstable as water, and can never be truly successful. All who profess Christ should be workers. There are no drones in the household of faith. Every member of the family has some task assigned him, some portion of the vineyard of the Lord in which to work. The only way to meet the demand of God is to be constantly persevering in our endeavors for higher usefulness. It is but little we can accomplish at best, \n\n108 \n\nbut every day's effort will increase our ability to labor effectually and to bear fruit to the glory of God.--4T 452-454.",
