    "word": "Religious life must characterize our business transactions if we keep the breath of life in our souls. We have been instructed that pure, strong faith in a \"thus saith the Lord\" must bear a signal part in all our business enterprises, else all who are connected with these enterprises, whatever they may be, will stand on losing ground. When God can accept us as laborers together with Him in seeking to save the souls ready to perish He can cooperate with us in carrying forward the enterprises with which we are connected. And His cooperation places us where our efforts work out His plans. It unites us with Christ, and from Him we derive the nourishment that enables us to bear \"much fruit.\" \n\n\n                                    -290-",
