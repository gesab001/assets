    "word": "This is the day of the Lord's preparation. We have no time now to talk unbelief and to gossip, no time now to do the devil's work. Let everyone beware of unsettling the faith of others by sowing seeds of envy, jealousy, disunion; for God hears the words, and judges, not by assertions, which are yea and nay, but by the fruit one's course of action produces. \"By their fruits ye shall know them\" (Matthew 7:20). The seed sown will determine the character of the harvest.\"--Manuscript 32a, 1896.",
