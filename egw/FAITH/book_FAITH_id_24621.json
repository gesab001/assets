    "word": "My brother and sister, let us be like Jesus. Throw around your son the atmosphere of tenderness; now manifest your affection and your forgiveness, and this will do for him just what it would do for you--break down every barrier and melt your heart of stone. Hold your son in faith, grieved and disappointed and dishonored as you may feel. Save him, save him, save him from ruin! He needs you now, father and mother. I know you will not give him up to his deadly foe.",
