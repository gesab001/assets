    "word": "You ask me why it is that you awake in the night and feel enclosed in darkness? I often feel the same way myself; but these desponding feelings are no evidence that God has forsaken you or me. . . . Gloomy feelings are no evidence that the promises of God are of no effect. You look at your feelings, and because your outlook is not all brightness, you begin to draw more closely the garment of heaviness about your soul. You look within yourself and think that God has forsaken you. You are to look to Christ. . . . Entering into communion with the Saviour, we enter the region of peace. . . . We must put faith into constant exercise, and trust in God \n\n\n                                 -281- \n\nwhatever our feelings may be. . . . We are to be of good cheer, knowing that Christ has overcome the world. We will have tribulation in the world, but peace in Jesus Christ. My brother, turn your eyes from within, and look to Jesus  who is your only helper .--Letter 26, 1895, pp. 7, 8, 10. (To Elder S. N. Haskell, Oct. 11, 1895.)",
