    "word": "A Christian influence should pervade our schools, our sanitariums, our publishing houses. Under the direction of Satan, confederacies are being formed, and will be formed, to eclipse the truth by human influence. Those who join these confederacies can never hear the welcome, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant;. . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" The instrumentalities established by God are to press forward, making no compromise with the power of darkness. Much more must be done in Christ's lines than has yet been done.",
