    "word": "Never is such a man to manifest self-importance, or attempt to act as a dictator or a ruler. Let him watch and pray, and keep his eye single to the glory of God. As his imagination takes hold upon things unseen, and he contemplates the joy of the hope that is set before him,--even the precious boon of life eternal,--the commendation of man will not fill his mind with thoughts of pride.
