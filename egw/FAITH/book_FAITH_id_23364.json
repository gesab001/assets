    "word": "The souls who have newly come to the faith, and others who have not fully decided, are stirred in regard to building a church; we will call it a tabernacle. We have a neat, nice place of worship at Cooranbong, every way appropriate. It was dedicated without one penny of debt upon it. This can be a pattern for Stanmore, if proper grounds can be obtained; if not, we shall have to select some suburb nearer Sydney. We think there will be considerable help from outside parties.",
