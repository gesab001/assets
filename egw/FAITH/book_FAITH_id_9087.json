    "word": "The faith mentioned in God\u2019s Word calls for a life in which faith in Christ is an active, living principle. It is God\u2019s will that faith in Christ shall be made perfect by works; He connects the salvation and eternal life of those who believe, with these works, and through them provides for the light of truth to go to all countries and peoples. This is the fruit of the workings of God\u2019s Spirit.",
