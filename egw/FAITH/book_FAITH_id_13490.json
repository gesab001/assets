    "word": "Jesus accepted his acknowledgment, but mildly rebuked him for his unbelief: \"Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou has believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\" Jesus here showed Thomas that his faith would have been more acceptable to him if he had believed the evidence of his brethren, and had not refused to believe until he had seen Jesus with his own eyes. If the world should follow this example of Thomas, no one would believe unto salvation; for all who now receive Christ do so through the testimony of others.",
