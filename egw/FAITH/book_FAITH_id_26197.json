    "word": "A sacred relationship exists between Christ our Saviour and the believer. He says, \"I will betroth thee unto me forever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord.\" \"Thou shalt know.\" Is not this the desire of the soul? There are many who ridicule the idea of there being any certainty in religious experience. Some cannot bear to hear sanctification and the higher attainments spoken about. But the Word says, \"Thou shalt know\" the Lord, and this means holiness and sanctification.",
