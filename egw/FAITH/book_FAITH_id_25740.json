    "word": "Let us look at the case of Elijah. He meets his mortal enemy, the king, the despotic ruler, an apostate from true religion. The king accuses Elijah, \"Art thou he that troubleth Israel?\" 1 Kings 18:17. Does Elijah excuse himself? Does he resort to flattery? Does he betray sacred trusts because Israel has perverted her faith and disowned her allegiance to her God? Does he prophesy smooth things to please and pacify the king and secure his favor? No, no! Will he evade the issue? Will he conceal from the king the true cause of the judgments of God that are falling upon the whole land of Israel? No, no! Elijah is a man who proclaims the truth, just such truth as the occasion demands. He carries a weight, a great burden and sorrow for apostate Israel. He must hold up before them their defection that they may humble themselves before God that He may turn away His fierce anger from them. The answer came from Elijah, \"I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim.\" 1 Kings 18:18.",
