    "word": "The people of God are to walk in the light, and to be united in the great work of making up the breach that has been made in the law of God by the man of sin. They are to raise up the foundations of many generations. Not one who really believes the truth will stand feebly by in this perilous time as mere spectators without interest or energy. The flame of love for God must be kindled in every heart and in every home. Pettishness and stubbornness must die. Let all the people offer prayer in simplicity and faith that the banner of truth may be carried into new territory, and that souls may be brought into subjection to the Lord God of heaven.",
