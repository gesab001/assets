    "word": "The deliverance of the people of God and His mercies to them in past trials are to be called to mind as an assurance of that which, if we trust in God, He will do for us in present and future emergencies. Whatever may have been their experience, if they will surrender to God with full purpose of heart, with humility and contrition, He will receive them. To all who by faith receive Christ as their personal Saviour, He will give power to become overcomers--sons and daughters of God. They become partakers of the divine nature, and fully realize His mercy and the grace of His Holy Spirit. . . .",
