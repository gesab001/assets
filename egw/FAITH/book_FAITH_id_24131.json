    "word": "We who are on our way to another country need the presence of God, and those whom we have left behind also need to inquire constantly at the throne of grace, \"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\" Those who live in close fellowship with Christ will be promoted by Him to positions of trust. The servant who does the best he can for his master is admitted to familiar intercourse with the One whose commands he loves to obey. In the faithful discharge of duty we may become one with Christ. The one who talks most familiarly with his divine Leader has the most exalted conception of His greatness, and is the most obedient to His commands. \n     [John 15:7-15; Proverbs 3:5; James 1:5-7, quoted.]",
