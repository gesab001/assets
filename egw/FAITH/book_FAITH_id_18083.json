    "word": "Hannah\u2019s prayer was granted; she received the gift for which she had so earnestly entreated. As she looked upon the child, she called him Samuel\u2014\u201casked of God.\u201d As soon as the little one was old enough to be separated from his mother, she fulfilled her vow. . . . From Shiloh, Hannah quietly returned to her home at Ramah, leaving the child Samuel to be trained for service in the house of God, under the instruction of the high priest. From the earliest dawn of intellect she had taught her son to love and reverence God and to regard himself as the Lord\u2019s. By every familiar object surrounding him she had sought to lead his thoughts up to the Creator. When separated from her child, the faithful mother\u2019s solicitude did not cease. Every day he was the subject of her prayers. . . . She did not ask for her son worldly greatness, but she earnestly pleaded that he might attain that greatness which Heaven values\u2014that he might honor God and bless his fellow human beings.\u2014Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 569-572.",
