    "word": "Suppose that we had not another promise in all the lids of the Scripture, is not this enough to condemn every soul that has not a living faith in a personal Saviour? \"Whosoever believeth in Him. . . .\" God gave His only begotten Son that whosoever, and that whosoever means you and me, it means parents and children. For whom did Christ die? Was it for a select few? It was for the whole world, the world that was fallen because of transgression. Adam and Eve became sinners because of transgression, and now the Lord has given to the world His only begotten Son--that He might abolish the law? that law that Adam transgressed? Do you read it thus? I do not.",
