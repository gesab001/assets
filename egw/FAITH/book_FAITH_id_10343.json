    "word": "We come to God in the name of Jesus by special invitation, and He welcomes us to His audience chamber. He imparts to the humble, contrite soul that faith in Christ by which he is justified. Jesus blots out as a thick cloud his transgression, and the comforted heart exclaims, \u201cO Lord, I will praise Thee: though Thou wast angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortedst me.\u201d Isaiah 12:1.\u2014(Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 242.)",
