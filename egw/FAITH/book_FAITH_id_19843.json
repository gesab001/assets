    "word": "When one of God's institutions, which is engaged in doing his work, shall, through some lack of judgment on the part of its managers, fall into decay, let those institutions which are in a more prosperous condition do to the uttermost of their ability to lift the cripple institution to its feet, that the name of God be not dishonored. Every facility that we have in Europe for the advancement of the work is needed, and should stand in a healthy, wholesome condition before an ungodly world. Let not the angels of God who are ministering unto those who bear the responsibilities, see God's workers disheartened. Already the difficulties have increased by our delay, so that now the work of restoration will require greater labor and expense. In the name of the Lord we ask his people who have means, to arise and realize that God is the owner of all the property which they possess, and prove themselves faithful stewards. Repair the machinery which is essential to carry forward the work of God, that his people shall not become discouraged, and his work left to languish.",
