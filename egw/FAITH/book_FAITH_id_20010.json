    "word": "Let all in the Sanitarium, whether high or low, take heed that not one soul with whom they are connected suffers from selfish, narrow notions. Be noble, be broad, be Christlike; and this comprehends all goodness and faithfulness. Let it be impressed upon every one that the moral tone in every department of the Sanitarium must be elevated. Time must be given to personal religious culture. All must learn their lessons in the school of Christ,--learn to wear his yoke and to bear his burdens, not burdens of their own making. \"Learn of me,\" says Jesus, \"for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Let those in command learn how to train others by first training themselves to do justice \n\n\n                     -9- \n\nand love mercy. Do not excuse anything in yourselves that you would condemn in another. Never, never, seek to make the workers under you feel the hand of oppression. They are Christ's property. Be careful how you treat the purchase of his blood. You who are appointed as directors are yourselves to be under the direction of one master, even Christ. Take your orders from him. Work as he worked, in love. Give the workers cheerful, encouraging words, remembering that \"all ye are brethren.\"",
