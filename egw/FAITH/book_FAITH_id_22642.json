    "word": "Thus it is with the great majority of religionists. God calls for sincere heart-worship. The door to light and an intelligent knowledge of the truth is open to every sincere worker for God. In order for worship to be acceptable, it must be offered in faith and hope, and the life must be in harmony with it. God requires the devotion of heart, mind, soul, and strength. Our noblest powers are to be used to do Him homage. Our thoughts are to be conformed to His will; our affections sanctified to His service.--Letter 143, 1904, pp. 3,4. (To Marian Davis, April 28, 1904.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 3, 1980",
