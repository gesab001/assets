    "word": "Unable to Give an Intelligent Reason for Faith \n\n\n     Many who profess to believe the truth for these last days, will be found wanting. They have neglected the weightier matters. Their conversion is superficial, not deep, earnest, and thorough. They do not know why they believe \n                                                                           46\nthe truth, only because others have believed it, and they take it for granted that it is the truth. They can give no intelligent reason why they believe. . . . Others are not enlightened or edified by their experience, or by the knowledge which it was their privilege and duty to obtain. Strength and stability are with truehearted professors.-- Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 634.",
