    "word": "The Lord supported His faithful ones to the end. This should be an encouragement. It should give confidence to the righteous in all ages that \n\n\n                                    -276- \n\nthe Lord is unchangeable. He will manifest for His people in this age His grace and His power as He has done in past ages. The declarations of God's Word and the accuracy with which He has made them good in history combine to give us assurance and instruction of greatest value. Nothing can shake the pledge we have from God Himself that with the Bible for our guide and present help, we shall have peace under all circumstances, and an eternal weight of glory for our future reward.",
