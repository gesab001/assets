    "word": "Take Heed How Ye Hear \n\n     From time to time we need unitedly to examine the reasons of our faith. It is essential that we study carefully the truths of God's Word; for we read that \"some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\" We are in grave danger when we lightly regard any truth; for then the mind is opened to error. We must take heed how and what we hear. We need not seek to understand the arguments that men offer in support of their theories, when it may be readily discerned that these theories are not in harmony with the Scriptures. Some who think that they have scientific knowledge are by their interpretations giving wrong ideas both of science and of the Bible. Let the Bible decide every question that is essential to man's salvation. . . .",
