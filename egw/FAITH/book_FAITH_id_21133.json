    "word": "\"The best help that ministers can give the members of our churches is not sermonizing, but planning work for them. Give each one something to do for others. . . . And let all be taught how to work. Especially should those who are newly come to the faith be educated to become laborers together with God. If set to work, the despondent will soon forget their despondency; the weak will become strong, the ignorant intelligent, and all will be prepared to present the truth as it is in Jesus.\"--Id., Vol. IX, p. 82.",
