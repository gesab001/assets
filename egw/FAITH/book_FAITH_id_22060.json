    "word": "\"I write unto you, fathers because ye have known Him that is from the beginning.\" 1 John 2:14. These are the old disciples who are the warriors of the faith. \"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life; (for the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.\" 1 John 1:1-4.",
