    "word": "While in Vision She Did Not Breathe.--Some of the instruction found in these pages was given under circumstances so remarkable as to evidence the wonder-working power of God in behalf of His truth. \n                                                                           39\nSometimes while I was in vision, my friends would approach me, and exclaim, \"Why, she does not breathe!\" Placing a mirror before my lips, they found that no moisture gathered on the glass. It was while there was no sign of any breathing that I kept talking of the things that were being presented before me. These messages were thus given to substantiate the faith of all, that in these last days we might have confidence in the Spirit of Prophecy.",
