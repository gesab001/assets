    "word": "Pointing Out Duty in a Compulsory Way \n     We are God's property. In Jesus Christ we are to behold a pattern of what we should be. Every soul should be educated to look not to his fellow-men, but unto Christ. He is the author and the finisher of our faith. Let no man think it his place to point out to others in a compulsory manner their duty. This God forbids. All are to be guided in the path of duty, by the plain word of God.--Letter 172, 1907",
