    "word": "I am instructed to say to you that there is much important work awaiting you, out of and away from the places where you have hitherto worked. There are needy fields to be cultivated. Shall the desolate places remain desolate? I answer, No, no; but the work where you now are is not yet completed. Let the stream of righteousness continue to flow. Let life and peace of joy come to souls ready to perish. The Lord will certainly water the seed that is sown in hope and faith.",
