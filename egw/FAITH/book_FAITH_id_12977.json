    "word": "How can those who expect to stand around Christ's throne, and to be clothed with His righteousness, distrust God, and fear that He will leave them to come to want? Where is their faith? Our heavenly Father feeds the ravens, and will He not much more feed us? . . . If we had a right view of Christ, we would permit nothing to interpose between ourselves and Him. . . .  Those who study to see how near they can live to the world and yet gain heaven, will come just near enough to be shut out from heaven. We must accept the suffering part of religion if we would sit down with the Suffering One upon His throne.",
