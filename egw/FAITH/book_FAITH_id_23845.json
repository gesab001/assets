    "word": "Can a human being remove from his heart one stain of sin? No. Looking into the law of God, he sees himself a sinner; but he has no power to cleanse himself from sin. Only by faith in Christ can he be purified. He is the one who takes away the sin of the world. \"He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.\"",
