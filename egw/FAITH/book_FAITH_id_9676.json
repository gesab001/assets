    "word": "There will ever be a spirit to rise up against reproof.--There will ever be a spirit to rise up against the reproof of sins and wrongs. But the voice of reproof should not be hushed because of this. Those whom God has set apart as ministers of righteousness have solemn responsibilities laid upon them to reprove the sins of the people. Paul commanded Titus, \"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.\" There are ever those who will despise the one who dares to reprove sin. But when required, reproof must be given. Paul directs Titus to rebuke a certain class sharply, that they may be sound in the faith. And how shall the reproof be given? Let the apostle answer: \"With all long-suffering and doctrine.\" The one at fault must be shown that his course is not in harmony with the Word of God. But never should the wrongs of God's people be passed by indifferently. Those who faithfully discharge their unpleasant duties under a sense of their accountability to God, will receive his blessing.--ST Sept. 16, 1880.",
