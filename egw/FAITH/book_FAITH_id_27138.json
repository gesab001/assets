    "word": "The temperance question is to be respected by every true Christian, and especially should it receive the sanction of all who profess to be reformers. But there will be those in the church who will not show wisdom in their disrespect to any reforms arising from any other people besides those of their own faith; in this they err by being too exclusive. Others will eagerly grasp every new thing which makes a pretense of temperance, having every other interest swallowed up on this one point. The peculiar, holy character of our faith is ignored, the views of others upon temperance are embraced, and an alliance formed between God's commandment-keeping people and all classes of persons.",
