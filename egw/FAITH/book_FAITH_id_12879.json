    "word": "As we see the results which have followed a disregard of God's law,--dishonesty, theft, licentiousness, drunkenness, and murder,-- we are prepared to say with the psalmist, \"I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold\"; \"in keeping of them, there is great reward.\" When the divine law is set aside, the greatest misery will result, both to families and to society. Our only hope of better things is to be found in a faithful adherence to the precepts of Jehovah. Infidel France once tried the experiment of rejecting the authority of God. What scenes of horror followed! Men cast aside the divine law as a yoke of bondage, and in their boasted liberty they placed themselves under the rule of the veriest tyrant. Anarchy and bloodshed ruled that terrible day. It was then demonstrated to the world that the surest way to undermine the foundation of order and government, is to set at naught the law of God. . . .",
