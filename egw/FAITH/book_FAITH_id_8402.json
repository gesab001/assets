    "word": "Faith Should Be Expressed.--If we would give more expression to our faith, rejoice more in the blessings that we know we have--the great mercy, forbearance, and love of God--we would daily have greater strength. Have not the precious words spoken by Christ, the Prince of God, an assurance and power that should have great influence upon us, that our heavenly Father is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than parents are to give good gifts to their children?--Lt 7, 1892.
