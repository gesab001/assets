    "word": "Not One Heretical Sentence.--I am now looking over my diaries [SEE FOOTNOTE, P. 32.] and copies of  letters written for several years back. . . . I have the most  precious matter to reproduce and place before the people in  testimony form. While I am able to do this work, the people must have things to revive past history, that they may see that there is one straight chain of truth, without one heretical sentence, in that which I have written. This, I am instructed, is to be a living letter to all in regard to my faith.--Letter 329a, 1905.",
