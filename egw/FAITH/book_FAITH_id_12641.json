    "word": "Chapter IV - Ordination of Paul and Barnabas\n\n     The apostles and disciples who left Jerusalem during the fierce persecution that raged there after the martyrdom of Stephen, preached Christ in the cities round about, confining their labors to the Hebrew and Greek Jews. \"And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.\" When the believers in Jerusalem heard the good tidings, they rejoiced; and Barnabas, \"a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith,\" was sent to Antioch, the metropolis of Syria, to help the church there. He labored there with great success. As the work increased, he solicited and obtained the help of Paul; and the two disciples labored together in that city for a year, teaching the people, and adding to the numbers of the church of Christ.",
