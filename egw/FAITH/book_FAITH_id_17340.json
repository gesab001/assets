    "word": "Instead of stimulating doubt, strengthen faith by every word, attitude, and practice. Make known that we have a living Saviour, a real, spiritual life, to receive and to impart. Guide others who are now on sliding sand to plant their feet on solid rock. There are souls to be revived, many to receive the joy of salvation into their own souls. They have erred, they have not been building a right character; but God has joy to restore to them, even the joy of His anointed. This will give efficiency and happiness and sanctified assurance, a living testimony. Tell the poor desponding ones who have gone astray from straight paths, tell them they need not despair. There is healing, cleansing for every soul who will come to Christ. There is a balm in Gilead, there is a physician there.",
