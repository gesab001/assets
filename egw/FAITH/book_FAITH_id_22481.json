    "word": "[See 2 Peter 1:1-11.] This is the faith which we must have, that works by love, and purifies the soul. There is no place in the school of Christ where we graduate. We are to work on the plan of addition, and the Lord will work on the plan of multiplication. It is through constant diligence that we will, through the grace of Christ, live on the plan of addition, making our calling and election sure. For if ye do these things--\"add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity\"--\"for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ\" (2 Peter 1:1, 5-7, 10, 11).--Letter 44, 1893, pp. 4-6.
