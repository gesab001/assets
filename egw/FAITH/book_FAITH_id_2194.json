    "word": "Letter 324, 1905\n     264. I am given a message to give to you: Eat at regular periods. By wrong habits of eating, you are preparing yourself for future suffering. It is not always safe to comply with invitations to meals, even though given by your brethren and friends, who wish to lavish upon you many kinds of food. You know that you can eat two or three kinds of food at a meal without injury to your digestive organs. When you are invited out to a meal, shun the many varieties of food that those who have invited you set before you. This you must do if you would be a faithful sentinel. When food is placed before us, which, if eaten, would cause the digestive organs hours of hard work, we must not, if we eat this food, blame those who set it before us for the result. God expects us to decide for ourselves to eat that food only which will not cause suffering to the digestive organs. \n     [THE BODY TO BE SERVANT TO THE MIND--35] \n     [EARLY EDUCATION OF THE APPETITE--346, 353] \n     [APPETITE TO BE DENIED WITH INTEREST AND ZEAL--65] \n     [PRAYER FOR HEALING BY THE INTEMPERATE--29] \n     [EFFECTS OF INDULGENCE ON INFLUENCE AND USEFULNESS--72]",
