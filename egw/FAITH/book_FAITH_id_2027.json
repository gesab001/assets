    "word": "Counsel to One Who Alone Becomes Converted After Marriage\nHe who has entered the marriage relation while unconverted is by his conversion placed under stronger obligation to be faithful to his \n124\ncompanion, however widely they may differ in regard to religious faith; yet the claims of God should be placed above every earthly relationship, even though trials and persecution may be the result. With the spirit of love and meekness, this fidelity may have an influence to win the unbelieving one.  AH 48, 49, 61-69175",
