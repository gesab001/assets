It is only as spiritual and moral integrity become an abiding characteristic, at all times, in all places, that we are able to place a proper estimate upon the holy faith once delivered to the saints.

In this way they will be fitting to enter the higher school of patriarchs and prophets, to associate with redeemed and sanctified of all ages.
