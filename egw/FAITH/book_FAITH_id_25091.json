    "word": "Oh, I am so thankful, so thankful, that we have a Saviour who can sympathize with us in everything through which we are called to pass! He loves us with an infinite love. Shall we not so relate ourselves to Him that He can fulfill His purpose concerning us? He desires to cleanse us from sin. As John the Baptist was preaching and baptizing on the banks of the Jordan, he saw Christ coming toward him, and, recognizing Him as the Saviour, he cried out, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away \n\n\n                 -235- \n\nthe sin of the world!\" Shall not we decide to let Christ take away our sin? Is sinning so great a pleasure to us that we will decide to continue to grieve the One whose heart is filled with infinite love for us? Why not cease sinning? We can do this by faith, if we lay hold on Christ's promises, and say, \"In my hand no price I bring; Simply to Thy cross I cling.\"",
