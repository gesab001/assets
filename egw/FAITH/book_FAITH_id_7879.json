    "word": "The Lord would have our physicians cooperate with Him in their treatment of the sick, showing more faith and using fewer drugs. Let us rely upon God. Our faith is feeble, and our hearts remain unchanged. God would have a change take place. He says, \"A new heart also will I give you.\" When this promise is fulfilled to the people of God, the condition of things will be very different from what it now is.--MS. 14, 1904.",
