    "word": "God is not pleased to have His people hanging dark and painful pictures in memory\u2019s hall. He would have every soul plucking the roses and the lilies and the pinks, hanging memory\u2019s hall with the precious promises of God blooming all over the garden of God. He would have us dwelling upon them, our senses sharp and clear, taking them in their full richness, talking of the joy that is set before us. He would have us living in the world, yet not of it, our affections taking hold of eternal things. He would have us talking of the things which He has prepared for those that love Him. This will attract our minds, awaken our hopes \n175\nand expectations, and strengthen our souls to endure the conflicts and trials of this life. As we dwell on these scenes the Lord will encourage our faith and confidence. He will draw aside the veil and give us glimpses of the saints\u2019 inheritance.\u2014Ms 24, 1888 quoted in 3SM 163, 164.",
