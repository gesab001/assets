    "word": "The two classes of watchers represent the two classes who profess to be waiting for their Lord. They are called virgins because they profess a pure faith. By the lamps is represented the Word of God. The psalmist says, \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\" The oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Thus the Spirit is represented in the prophecy of Zechariah. . . . \"I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, . . . and two olive trees by it.\" . . .",
