    "word": "What shall we say to you who are periodically doubters and grumblers? Indigestion is a trial, but do not make it worse by quarrelling with circumstances. Get your Bibles and hymnbooks, and read and sing and pray, and go to work to help some poor soul who is in bodily suffering or despondency of soul. Pray in faith for the Lord to help both him and you. Do not, as you try to recover, put on a dismal, mourning attitude as though prison walls enclose you and shut out every ray of sunlight. Pray short, easy prayers full of words of promise, and you will find yourselves out of the darkness into the light.",
