    "word": "Here are presented to us the riches of heaven's blessings. We cannot conceive of anything greater or more blessed. We have here the possibility before the human agent. It is the will of God that we should be so thoroughly identified with His Son that we shall be one with Christ as Christ is one with the Father. Through faith we may be wholly one with Christ; we may have our entire soul, body and spirit bound up with Christ in God, so that we shall share in the very same love wherewith Christ is loved by the Father.",
