    "word": "Many churches were thrown open to the enemies of the Advent faith, while they were closed against its friends. The sentiments expressed by Doctor Eck concerning Luther were the same that inspired ministers and people to refuse Adventists a hearing. Said the papal champion: \"I am surprised at the humility and modesty with which the reverend doctor [Luther] undertakes to oppose, alone, so many illustrious Fathers, thus affirming that he knows more of these things than the sovereign pontiffs, the councils, the doctors, and the universities.\" \"It would be surprising, no doubt, if God had hidden the truth from so many saints and martyrs until the advent of the reverend father.\" Thus thought great and wise men in the days of Noah, thus argued the opponents of Wm. Miller, and thus still argue those who oppose the proclamation of the Advent faith and the commandments of God.",
