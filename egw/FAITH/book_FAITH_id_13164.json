    "word": "Christ applied himself diligently to a study of the Scriptures; for he knew them to be full of precious instruction to all who will make it the man of their counsel. He was faithful in the discharge of his home duties, and the early morning hours, instead of being wasted in bed, often found him in a retired place, meditating and searching the Scriptures, and in prayer. Every prophecy concerning his work and mediation was familiar to him, especially those having reference to his humiliation, atonement, and intercession. In childhood and youth the object of his life was ever before him, an inducement for his undertaking the work of mediating in behalf of fallen man. He would see seed which should prolong their days, and the gracious purpose of the Lord should prosper in his hands.",
