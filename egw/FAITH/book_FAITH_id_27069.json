Evans, then treasurer of the General Conference, Ellen White laments the \u201chindering policy\u201d some in the church continued to impose.\nDear Brother Evans:\n     While we were endeavoring to build up the work in Australia, which we did under great difficulties, the hindering policy was a grief to us and a shame to the people who professed to hold this precious, sacred truth regarding the soon coming of the Lord. It has been under similar difficulties that the workers at Madison and Huntsville have labored to establish their work. Had a true spirit of unselfishness rested upon the men at the head of the work, the Madison enterprise would have had the support of the people, and the work there would have gone forward much more rapidly. Many more souls would now be in the field, giving the message in the cities of the Southern field, and long ere this many of the cities of the South would have been faithfully worked.",
