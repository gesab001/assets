These persons have lost the simplicity of faith, and are removed far from God in mind and spirit. There should be a settled faith in the divinity of God's holy word. The Bible is not to be tested by men's ideas of science, but science is to be brought to the test of this unerring standard.

One does not contradict the other. All truths, whether in nature or revelation, agree. Scientific research will open to the minds of the really wise, vast fields of thought and information.
