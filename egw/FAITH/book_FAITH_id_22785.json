    "word": "Possibilities of Discouragement \n\n\n     In 1905, Ellen White, in vision, saw Elder Prescott with some others in a meeting where discouraging aspects of the work were dwelt upon and \"possibilities of a discouraging nature were presented\" (Ms 115, 1905). A heavenly messenger stood before those present and admonished, \"You are to serve God more perfectly. I have not found thy ways perfect before God. There is need of trustful, unwavering faith and joy in the Lord.\" (Ibid.)",
