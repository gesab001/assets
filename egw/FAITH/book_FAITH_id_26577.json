    "word": "\"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him, rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught.\" Through faith we receive the Lord Jesus. Through faith we are united to Him. Through faith we are rooted and established in Him. We are united with Christ. We are not to lose our first love. He will each day do for us who are repenting, believing sinners just as much as He did when we first surrendered our hearts to Him.",
