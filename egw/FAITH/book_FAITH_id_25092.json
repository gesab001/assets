    "word": "Christ is our great Physician. Many men and women come to this medical institution with the hope of receiving treatment that will prolong their lives. They take considerable pains to come here. Why cannot everyone who comes to the sanitarium for physical help, come to Christ for spiritual help? Why cannot you, my brother, my sister, entertain the hope that if you accept Christ He will add His blessing to the agencies employed for your restoration to health? Why cannot you have faith to believe that He \n\n\n                  -236- \n\nwill cooperate with your efforts to recover, because He wants you to get well? He wants you to have a clear brain, so that you can appreciate eternal realities; He wants you to have healthful sinews and muscles, so that you can glorify His name by using your strength in His service.",
