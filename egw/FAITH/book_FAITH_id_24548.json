    "word": "We have not had the most pleasant labor altogether since coming to California. It has been a kind of labor that tried the soul and that naturally brings discouragement. It has been most trying to my soul. My heart has been grieved within me to have to labor on every hand against this freedom, married men with women and girls. Oh! it has caused me intense pain. I have tried to labor to correct these evils, and have seen the depths of Satan's working, but I try to be faithful. I get but little encouragement.",
