    "word": "There is much more that I wish to write to our people, but what I shall write will only be a confirmation of the messages given in the past.

But the Lord has shown me that all that can be given to these souls is but a repetition and confirmation of the truths that have already been placed impressively before them. Not one principle of the truths we have held in the past can be denied.",
