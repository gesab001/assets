    "word": "Relation of E. G. White Writings to the Bible Recognized in First Book.--I recommend to you, dear reader, the Word of God as the rule of your faith and practice. By that Word we are to be judged. God has, in that Word, promised to give visions in the \"last days\"; not for a new rule of faith, but for the comfort of His people, and to correct those who err from Bible truth. Thus God dealt with Peter when He was about to send him to preach to the Gentiles.--A Sketch of the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White, p. 64 (1851). (Reprinted in Early Writings, p. 78.)",
