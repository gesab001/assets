    "word": "We hold no doctrine that we wish to hide. To those who have been educated to keep the first day of the week as a sacred day, the most objectionable feature of our faith is the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. But does not God's Word declare that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God? And although it is not an easy matter to make the required change from the first to the seventh day, this change must be made. It involves a cross; it clashes with the precepts \n\n\n                        - 9 - \n\nand practices of men. Learned men have taught the people until they are full of unbelief and prejudice; and yet we must say to these people, \"Come and see.\" God requires us to proclaim the truth, and let it discover error.",
