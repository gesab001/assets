    "word": "The physician should look higher than himself. In simple, soothing words he should speak to the sufferer of the great Physician. He who cannot do this loses case after case which he might save if he were a Christian. If he could speak to the sufferer words that would inspire faith in the sympathizing Saviour, who feels every throb of anguish, the crisis would be passed safely. The sufferer would be strengthened to look and live.",
