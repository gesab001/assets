    "word": "The injunction to cleave to the Lord will be precious to us if we will understand and obey it. Trust constantly in God. Have unswerving faith in Him because of the unmistakable evidence given you of His love and power. Never does one stretch out his arms in faith to the Saviour but there are placed around and underneath him the everlasting arms, and he is comforted and sustained.",
