    "word": "The cross lies directly in our way. We must lift it and bear it and have not one particle of self-sufficiency, but be firm and intelligent in the wisdom which God gives. Oh, there is danger of being led away from Christ while we may think we are walking with Christ because [we are] acting a part in His work. Whatever may be our capabilities entrusted to us of God for wise improvement, we are not to flatter ourselves because of the possession of these gifts. We must have faith in God and trust Him with perfect simplicity. Without this we shall make mistakes. God has wisdom, grace, and power for us individually. Lay hold upon these precious gifts. I must close this now. \n\n\n                                     -240- \n\nI blow out my light and stop my writing.",
