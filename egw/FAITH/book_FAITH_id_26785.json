    "word": "The flood of corruption that is sweeping over our world is the result of the misuse and abuse of the human machinery. Men, women, and children should be educated to labor with their hands. Then the brain will not be overtaxed, to the detriment of the whole organism. Time is a talent, to be wisely employed. The voice is a talent, to be used in communicating knowledge that will make men pure, holy, and refined. The tongue should be educated to speak in such a manner that God will be magnified. \"Lord, increase my faith,\" will be the prayer of the true child of God. \"Deliver me from evil thoughts and perverse actions.\" Thus he is enabled to say with boldness, \"Behold, God is my salvation: I will trust and not be afraid. For the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.\" Completeness of Christian character is possible. How? - \"We are complete in Him.\" \n\n\n                (From Doctor Paulson's Collection) \n\n\n                                                             91.",
