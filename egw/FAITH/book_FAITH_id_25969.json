    "word": "I greatly desired that Byron and Sarah should live with me in Cooranbong. They could both have been a great help to me. He was a good financier. He possessed excellent business capabilities, and for this reason every camp-meeting they held they urged Byron and Sarah to take charge of the restaurant. In business matters of buying supplies for camp-meetings and the school he could not be excelled. But I felt that both Byron and Sarah must have opportunities to fit them for missionary work. He has excelled in being superintendent of Sabbath schools, conducting the reviews, and has exhibited a clearness of thought \n                                                                           1470\nand adaptability that I thought would prove of great service. Conversing with him I drew him out. He wished to attend the school in Melbourne and I told him I would set to his service to accomplish this, two hundred dollars. But they both said, Aunt Ellen we cannot take means from you; you are investing in the cause of God constantly; let your money be used to help along the work in educating students, in building meeting houses and in different lines of work that you may be called to do, but Sarah and I will get along by the help of God, and practicing strictest economy. I learned he desired to engage in the work with other workers in Sidney and suburbs. I asked him how much he would require. He said, One pound per week. I said, That is not enough. He said, Yes it would keep him and Sarah. I was already paying 19.00 per week to keep several workers in the field. The great last burden of Byron was that the workers should not become discouraged and faint-hearted. He made every effort in his power to encourage perseverance and faith. He will not fail nor be discouraged, Seemed to be inwrought in his being.",
