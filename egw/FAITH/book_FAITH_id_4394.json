    "word": "From the first opening of a book, the candidate for an education should recognize God as the one who imparts true wisdom. He should seek His counsel at every step along the way. No arrangement should be made to which God cannot be made a party, no union formed of which He is not the approver. The Author of wisdom should be recognized as the Guide from first to last. In this manner the knowledge obtained from books will be bound off by a living faith in the infinite God. The student should not permit himself to be bound down to any particular course of studies involving long periods of time, but should be guided in such matters by the Spirit of God.",
