    "word": "I now present before E. P. Daniels his pitiable case. Anyone, whatever his position or influence, who will desire him to preach to the churches in his present unestablished condition, cannot discern spiritual things. Elder Daniels says, \"I believe the testimonies, but I do not understand them; I believe in health reform, but I do not understand it.\" This is a falsehood to his own soul. If he is in this position, let him repent and do his first works. There are enough who are giving the trumpet no certain sound. Men like faithful Caleb are wanted now, who can give a ringing message. It is a goodly land that we are going to, and we are well able to go up and possess it. We want no shepherds who cannot discern between truth and falsehood, who give mixed provender of truth and error. \n\n\n                              [11]",
