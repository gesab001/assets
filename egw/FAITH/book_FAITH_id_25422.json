    "word": "We should know for ourselves what constitutes Christianity, what is truth, what is the faith that we have received, what are the Bible rules--the rules given us from the highest authority.

If an idea is presented that harmonizes with their own preconceived opinions, they are all ready to accept it. They do not reason from cause to effect, their faith has no genuine foundation, and in the time of trial they will find that they have built upon the sand.",
