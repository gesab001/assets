    "word": "We are to show forth Him who hath called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. It is by living faith that we rest in that light. It is by living faith that we rejoice in that light every day. We are not to talk our doubts and trials, because they grow bigger every time we talk them. Every time we talk them, Satan has gained the victory; but when we say, \u201cI will commit the keeping of my soul unto Him, as unto a faithful witness,\u201d then we testify that we have given ourselves to Jesus Christ without any reservation, and then God gives us light and we rejoice in Him.",
