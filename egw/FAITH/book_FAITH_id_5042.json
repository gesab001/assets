    "word": "\"These things I have spoken unto you,\" He said, \"that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\" [John 16:33, ] Christ did not fail, neither was He discouraged; and His followers are to manifest a faith of the same enduring nature. They are to live as He lived, and work as He worked, because they depend on Him as the great Master-worker.",
