    "word": "Clasp the Hand of Christ \n\n     Not one thread of selfishness must be drawn into the fabric of character we are weaving. To go on without fear we must know that an almighty hand will hold us up, and an infinite humanity in Christ pities us. But do not let us pity ourselves, for this is not the thing to do. It is not enough for us to have faith in law and force, things which have no pity, and never hear the cry for help. We need to clasp a hand that is warm, and trust in a heart full of love and tenderness. We are never to feel that there is no danger, thinking, \"I have a large experience; I shall never fall.\" God permits the wisest to be brought into circumstances which reveal their human weakness. We shall meet with obstacles all along the path heavenward, but if we abide in Christ, self will not appear in so many ways.",
