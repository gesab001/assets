I have remembered you in my prayers many times. It was not my choice to come to Europe, but the General Conference urged my coming so earnestly I complied. I am not sorry I have done this, for the Lord has especially blessed me at every step. I have been sustained in a remarkable manner. I have done a great amount of labor and written many pages. I have been here two weeks, have spoken in a hall twelve times and written one hundred pages. I arise at four o'clock, and before the call to breakfast I have written from ten to fifteen pages. I have reason to praise God with heart and lips for His mercy and His sustaining grace.",
