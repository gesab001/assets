    "word": "Christ offers Himself as willing to save unto the uttermost all who come unto Him. He invites all to come to Him. \"Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out.\" You look in reality upon these subjects as I do, yet you make these subjects, through your expressions, confusing to minds. And after you have expressed your mind radically in regard to works, when questions are asked you upon this very subject, it is not lying out in so very clear lines, in your own mind, and you cannot define the correct principles to other minds, and you are yourself unable to make your statements harmonize with your own principles and faith.",
