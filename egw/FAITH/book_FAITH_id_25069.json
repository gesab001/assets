    "word": "It is to the glory of God for Him to give us of His virtue. He desires to see us rise to the highest standard. When by living faith we lay hold of the power of a living Christ; when we plead His unfailing promises, and claim them as ours; when we seek for the power of the Holy Spirit, we are eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God. And \"whoso . . . eateth My flesh,\" said Christ, \"and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. . . . The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:54, 56, 63).",
