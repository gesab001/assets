    "word": "We next visited Sister [Gurner], who is a widow. She has been thought by some to be a restless, complaining woman, and has been called a murmurer. But when I learned that she has not been able to read for twenty-eight years, I thought that instead of criticizing her, those of her sisters in the faith who have the blessing of eyesight should visit her and read to her as often as possible . Job says, \"I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame\" (Job 29:15). It is the duty of those who have sight to minister to the blind, so that the afflicted ones shall feel their loss as little as possible. We had a season of prayer with this sister, and the tender Spirit of the Lord rested upon us. Ms 21, 1892, pp. 16, 17. (\"Diary Written at Preston, Victoria, Australia,\" September 28, 1892.)",
