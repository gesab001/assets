    "word": "By faith let us look upon the rainbow round about the throne, the cloud of sins confessed behind it. The rainbow of promise is an assurance to every humble, contrite, believing soul, that his life is one with Christ, and that Christ is one with God. The wrath of God will not fall upon one soul that seeks refuge in Him. God Himself has declared, \"When I see the blood, I will pass over you.\" \"The bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant\" (Exodus 12:13; Genesis 9:16).",
