    "word": "The sheep that need to be fed, are scattered upon the mountains of Israel; they are starving to death on dry theories. My brethren, you do not feed the flock, you do not have faith, humility, and love. The most sacred responsibility rests upon those who have accepted the position of shepherds to the flock of God. But if the professed ministers of Christ are not endowed with the power from on high, they are not fit for the work of this time. The work calls for men who have spiritual energy, and far seeing discernment. God sends light to His people that they may live in His light according to their privileges. There are many who feel satisfied with their meager attainments, and they refuse the light that God sends them, saying by their attitude, \"I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing.\" In so doing they not only rob \n                                                                           406\ntheir own souls of spiritual knowledge, but they rob the souls of others. Those whom they endeavor to help, have to suffer loss because the teachers fail to employ their talents in the way that God would have them, and choose to place their own limited, narrow experience before the people, instead of the glorious gospel of Christ. They are like guide posts pointing in the wrong direction. They will forfeit the favor of God, and come under His displeasure, unless they change their course decidedly and humble their hearts before God.",
