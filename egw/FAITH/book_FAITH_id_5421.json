    "word": "During the persecution at Meaux, the teachers of the \n219\nreformed faith were deprived of their license to preach, and they departed to other fields. Lefevre after a time made his way to Germany. Farel returned to his native town in Eastern France, to spread the light in the home of his childhood. Already tidings had been received of what was going on at Meaux, and the truth, which he taught with fearless zeal, found listeners. Soon the authorities were roused to silence him, and he was banished from the city. Though he could no longer labor publicly, he traversed the plains and villages, teaching in private dwellings and in secluded meadows, and finding shelter in the forests and among the rocky caverns which had been his haunts in boyhood. God was preparing him for greater trials. \u201cCrosses, persecution, and  the lying-in-wait of Satan, of which I had intimation, were not wanting,\u201d he said; \u201cthey were even much more than I could have borne in my own strength; but God is my Father; he has ministered, and will forever minister, to me all needful strength.\u201d",
