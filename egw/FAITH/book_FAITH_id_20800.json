    "word": "The hand of God is stretched out to save his people from sinking into the formal. Christless \n\n\n                      -19- \n\nstate into which the Jewish nation sank; to slight the means which God has ordained for this purpose, is to slight Jesus. The soul that would be saved must co-operate with God in the work of salvation: the human and the divine must unite in faith and practise. If we would have pardon, we must confess our sins, and believe in the mercy of God.",
