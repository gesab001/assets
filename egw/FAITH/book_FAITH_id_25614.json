    "word": "If you have faith in the Testimonies, you will act out all the faith you have. You might just as well voice your attitude in regard to the work which the Lord has given me to do as to do as you have done. You have virtually said, \"I have not confidence in the message Sister White bears.\" You are far more guilty in taking the position that you have taken than these who know me not. You have known the character of my work from the beginning of our acquaintance which has been since Edson White was three years old. Brinkerhoof and Snook, had they had the light and knowledge you have had of the work God has given me to do, \n                                                                           733\nmight have stood to this day and you are far more guilty in the position you have taken with the testimonies sounding in your ears for the last two years, and unheeded. No confession has come from your lips, and I have been compelled to meet your influence in Minneapolis and since that time, everywhere I have been; and now the year 1890 is nearly closed. Will you fall on the Rock and be broken? Will you evade the point as you have done? Elders Millers both presented your case as evidence that they should resist the Spirit of God, the message and the messenger. Bro. Rupert has a work of confession. I told him two years ago when at Potterville, and he has heard the same again and again from my lips, but Brother Smith has been his stumbling block and the stumbling block of many others. The burden has been too great for me to bear. I decided without an entire change, I would not remain at Battle Creek for I would be sharing the sin of those who refused the spirit of God in correction and warnings. I would wear out my life for my brethren have made my work one-hundred fold harder than was necessary by their unbelief.",
