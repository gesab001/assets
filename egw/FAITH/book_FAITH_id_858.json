    "word": "Christ declared to the tempter, \u201cGet thee behind me, Satan.\u201d. . . So we may resist temptation and force Satan to depart from us. Jesus gained the victory through submission and faith in God, and by the apostle He says to us, \u201cSubmit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\u201d We cannot save ourselves from the tempter\u2019s power; he has conquered humanity, and when we try to stand in our own strength, we shall become a prey to his devices; but \u201cthe name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.\u201d Satan trembles and flees before the weakest soul who finds refuge in that mighty name.\u2014Manuscript 15, 1908.",
