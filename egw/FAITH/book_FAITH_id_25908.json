    "word": "Now in regard to myself, I care not for wages; but I do care for strict principle and equity. I do care for sound judgment when men who had entered into a confederacy have taken from God's treasury large wages that they no more earned or deserved than did others in the office or engaged in building up other branches of the cause, who received small wages, but who were doing their work conscientiously in integrity and whole-heartedness and purity, a deep wrong was done, that God does not wink at. When these men are converted, every dollar they have received above what they should have had will be returned to the treasury. We are dealing with Christ in the person of his saints. To allow one to be exalted, and another, more faithful and true, to be placed in a hard position, is not just and equal. God will surely repay these things.",
