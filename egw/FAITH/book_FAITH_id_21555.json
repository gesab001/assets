    "word": "Faithful in All Things. We are now at your Uncle Chase's. [NOTE: MRS. CHASE WAS ELDER JAMES WHITE'S SISTER.] Came here yesterday. We had no idea it was going to be so cold when we started, but heavy black clouds came up and we had quite a little flurry of partial snow and hail, all soft, about as large as a pea. Then it became so very cold we suffered in traveling fifteen miles. Last night was a very bitterly cold night.",
