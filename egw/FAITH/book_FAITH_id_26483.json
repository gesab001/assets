    "word": "\"As in the visions of the night I saw this place, I said to our brethren: O, ye of little faith! You have lost much time. On the lawn were the sick in wheel chairs. On the grounds of this beautiful place that I saw in the visions of the night, there were many shade trees the boughs of which hung down in such a way as to form leafy canopies somewhat in the shape of tents. Underneath these canopies patients were resting. The sick were delighted in their surroundings. While some worked, others were singing. There was no sign of dissatisfaction.",
