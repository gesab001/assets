    "word": "Elder Cottrell was one who stood in many respects on right ground. But a very strange thing came into our ranks in some of our leading men, that a position that some had, when once taken, was to be held under all events as never to be changed--infallibility. This has proved itself to be a great error. There is reformation to be made in churches. When the light of truth shall come to them, this would create harmonious sentiments, else the ones who now persist in their assumed infallibility would go out from us, as some have done. But some are found to take a position in opposition, which creates disunion, not particularly with the faith received, but in the expression of the faith; and that all that they may do is infallible, when no such things are to be accepted.",
