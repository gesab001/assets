    "word": "In consequence of Adam's sin, death passed upon the whole human race. All alike go down into the grave. And through the provisions of the plan of salvation, all are to be brought forth from their graves. \"There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust,\" \"for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" But a distinction is made between the two classes that are brought forth. \"All that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\" They who have been \"accounted worthy\" of the resurrection of life, are \"blessed and holy.\" \"On such the second death hath no power.\" But those who have not, through repentance and faith, secured pardon, must receive the penalty of transgression.",
