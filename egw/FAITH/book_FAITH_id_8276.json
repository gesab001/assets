    "word": "Conscientiousness Engenders Self-respect.--Men of principle need not the restriction of locks and keys; they do not need to be watched and guarded. They will deal truly and honorably at all times--alone, with no eye upon them, as well as in public. They will not bring a stain upon their souls for any amount of gain or selfish advantage. They scorn a mean act. Although no one else might know it, they would know it themselves, and this would destroy their self-respect. Those who are not conscientious and faithful in little things would not be reformed, were there laws and restrictions and penalties upon the point.--SpTPH 62, 1879. (CH 410.)",
