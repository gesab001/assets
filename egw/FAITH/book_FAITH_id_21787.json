    "word": "The Body as the Temple of God \n     We profess to believe a very great and solemn truth; we profess to believe that we are living in the very last scenes of this earth's history, and if we practice our faith we shall have a telling influence upon all that are around us. But if while we claim to believe this great and divine truth while our works do not correspond with our faith our influence is far less than though we made no profession to believe the sacred and important truths.",
