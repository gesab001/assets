    "word": "A Needful Discipline \n     Those who find it difficult to associate in harmony with the Lord's workers in this world, and who are anxious to remain apart by themselves, will have to pass through an entire change of character, else they will never see the kingdom of God. We are not all formed in the same mold of character; therefore association is a needful discipline, in order that we may learn to love God with all the affections and with every power of the mind. The whole being is to be transformed after the similitude of the heavenly Father, and of His Son Jesus. Those who are thus transformed, will have the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. This barricades the soul from every assault of the enemy.--Letter 32, 1906.",
