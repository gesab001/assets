    "word": "The light that shines forth from the life of the true Christian testifies to his union with Christ. Self is hidden from view, and Christ is revealed....\"Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is\" (1 John 3:2). Then those whose lives have been hidden with Christ, those who on this earth have fought the good fight of faith, will shine forth with the Redeemer's glory in the kingdom of God.",
