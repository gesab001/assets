    "word": "Christ is not dead. He has proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection and the life\" (John 11:25). Satan has thrown his dark shadow across our pathway, but let not our faith falter. Rather, let it cleave through the shadows to the place where Christ sits as our Intercessor. Satan is trying to hide the light of heaven from us, but he cannot do this if we will cling to the mighty One. Call upon the Lord, and He will answer, \"Here am I.\" Cooperate with God in striving against the enemy. Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and be determined that you will be temperate in all things.",
