    "word": "Do not wait to make yourselves better. How many there are who think that they are not good enough to come to Christ! Do you expect to become better through your own efforts? \"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.\" Jeremiah 13:23. But there is help for us in God. We are \"prisoners of hope.\" Zechariah 9:12. God has power in reserve for us. Those who are reaching out for help, exercising faith in Jesus, will receive it.",
