We must put on the robe of Christ's righteousness, and wear it openly, bravely, decidedly exhibiting Christ and not expect too much of finite man, but keep looking unto Jesus, and become ravished with the perfection of His character. Then we shall individually make manifest the character of Jesus, and make it evident that we are invigorated by the truth; because it sanctifies the soul and brings into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.--Letter 14, 1891, p. 11. (To Elder S. N. Haskell, December 11, 1891.)",
