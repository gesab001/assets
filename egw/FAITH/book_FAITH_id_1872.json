    "word": "The truth which Peter had confessed is the foundation of the believer's faith. It is that which Christ Himself has declared to be eternal life. But the possession of this knowledge was no ground for self-glorification. Through no wisdom or goodness of his own had it been revealed to Peter. Never can humanity, of itself, attain to a knowledge of the divine. \"It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?\" (Job 11:8). Only the spirit of adoption can reveal to us the deep things of God, which \"eye hath not seen, not ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man.\" \"God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God\" (1 Corinthians 2:9, 10).",
