    "word": "My message to our teachers is, If you hold such views you need to be taught the first principles of the truth. You need to stand where you know that you are not departing from the faith and giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. When you break the spell that is upon you, and become teachable, you will escape from Satan's snare. Through humility and reconversion you will again be adopted into the family of God.",
