    "word": "Satan's work will be manifested in such power that if it were possible he would deceive the very elect. And if he can, he will get your minds confused and you will lose sight of the truth and separate yourselves from the God of your strength. God wants you to be in that position where He can do great work for you. He wants you to have an intelligent faith. You do not want to present to the people a pattern mingled with defects of your character and give the world a false view of Jesus. It is our duty as Christians to represent Christ.",
