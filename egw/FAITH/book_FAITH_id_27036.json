A much broader work would have been accomplished there had our people moved forward in faith and self-denial. It was God\u2019s design that Huntsville should have convenient school buildings and a sanitarium for the colored people. This sanitarium building has become a positive necessity. Some of the brethren have been free to give their advice concerning this institution, saying that it should be \u201ca small sanitarium.\u201d The advice I have had to give has been that we should have a modest but roomy sanitarium, where the sick can be taken in and treated. The colored race should have the benefits of such an institution as verily as should the white people. In this sanitarium colored nurses are to be trained for service in the field as gospel medical missionaries.",
