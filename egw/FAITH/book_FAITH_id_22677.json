But everyone who takes up his cross to follow Christ comes to a Rephidim in his experience. God says to His people, Do not imitate the conduct of the children of Israel by showing unbelief when brought into difficulties, for \"there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it\" (1 Corinthians 10:13). . . .",
