    "word": "Suppose those who enter the field do meet with opposition; they will be but strengthened if they work in Christ's lines, and if they have but one talent to begin with it will not always remain one, but will become two. Then if the two are faithfully used, the talents will again be doubled, for heavenly wisdom will be imparted to the humble soul who walks by faith, imparting light under the most discouraging circumstances. He who handles the Lord's goods as faithfully in trading upon pence as upon pounds, will bring a large revenue into the Lord's treasury.",
