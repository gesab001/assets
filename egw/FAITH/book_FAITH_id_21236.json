    "word": "We are all to be tested here in this life to prove whether, if admitted to heaven, we shall repeat the same course that Satan pursued there. But if the character which we develop during our probation is according to the divine Pattern, it qualifies us to receive the welcome, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant. . . .enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\" (Matthew 25:21). But on the other hand, if men desire to be highly esteemed among men, if they are seeking for the highest positions, and demanding the highest remuneration they can obtain in this life, they will have just such characters in the future life. All heaven will pronounce them unfit for the kingdom, disqualified for any position of trust in the great work of God in the courts above. Our institutions are instrumentalities ordained of God, and the principles of equity, justice and righteousness must be maintained in them with fidelity. The work in which we are engaged must be done by men who are ordained of God as was Christ, to go forth with the spirit of sacrifice for the salvation of a lost world. This is the spirit that should characterize medical missionary work anywhere and everywhere. . . .",
