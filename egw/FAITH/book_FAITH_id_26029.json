    "word": "I have presented these things to you that you may not provoke the Lord's anger by adding any more to your wrong by appropriating for your own selfish purposes means that do not belong to you. Those who gave you their confidence, and sustained you, were given instructions of your purpose to injure and betray the cause of God, but they did not believe that you would do as you have done. They were afraid of you, and kept in association with you, fearing that by disconnecting with you, they would bring harm to the cause of God. The people of our faith did not know how the means they were investing to sustain the cause of God was being used, and now an empty treasury stares them in the face. This has been brought about largely through your suggestions and management, when connected with those who did not see or understand your purposes.",
