    "word": "It is highly important to know how to approach the sick with the comfort of a hope gained through faith in Christ Jesus and acceptance of His promises. When the awakened conscience cries out, \"Lord, be merciful to me a sinner; make me Thy child,\" be ready to tell the sufferer, the once indifferent one, that there is hope for him, that in Jesus he will find a refuge. The Saviour is inviting everyone, \"Look unto Me, and live. Come unto Me, and find rest.\" Those who in meekness and love present the hope of the gospel to afflicted souls so much in need of this hope, are the mouthpiece of the One who gave Himself for all mankind, that He might become a Healer, a tender, sympathetic, compassionate Saviour.",
