    "word": "Trials are permitted to come upon the chosen people of God. The expressions are used, \u201cGod tempted Abraham,\u201d\u201cGod tempted the children of Israel.\u201d This means that the Lord permitted Satan to tempt them in order that their faith might be found unto honor and glory when the judgment shall sit, and when every person shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body. God knows every heart, every motive, every thought in the heart; but He permits Satan to try and tempt and test His believing ones in order that their trust and confidence in God may be revealed. . . .",
