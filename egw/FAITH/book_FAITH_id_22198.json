    "word": "When the test and trial comes to every soul, there will be apostasies. Traitors, heady, highminded and self-sufficient men will turn away from the truth, making shipwreck of the faith. Why?--because they did not dig deep and make their foundation sure. They were not riveted to the Eternal Rock. When the words of the Lord, through His chosen messengers, are brought to them, they murmur and think the way is made too strait. Like those who were thought to be disciples of Christ, but who were displeased with His words, and walked no more with Him, they will turn away from Christ.--Ms 68, 1897, pp. 8, 9. (\"Correct School Discipline,\" June 21, 1897.)",
