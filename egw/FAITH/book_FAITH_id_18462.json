    "word": "Unless there is increased humility of heart and purity of action, things will be done that will lead to a whole train of mistakes. One mis-move, because of a lack of faith, has led to many disastrous circumstances. It does not appear such a great evil to let Satan rule and obtain the victory in little things, even when eternal interests are involved. But one misstep leads to a succession of missteps, and then to jealousy, and evil surmisings of the very one and the very things that God would have succeed.",
