    "word": "We are all in possession of talents, and we are not to give to another person our entrusted capabilities. We are to trade upon them, that we may gain other talents to use in the advancement of the Lord's work. For me to give up my stewardship of means for some one else to use \n\n\n                   -14- \n\nwould be unfaithfulness on my part. There are some persons in Battle Creek who pay a faithful tithe, and there are others who do not. Should any one put it out of their power to do this by selling their capabilities, and letting another become steward for him? It is our duty to improve our talents. The Lord would have every person manage his own business and handle his own talents. He does not desire his people to give away the only means they have to invest in his cause for their individual selves.",
