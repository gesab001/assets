    "word": "Entanglements in secular business are sometimes permitted by God to stir the sluggish faculties to more than common action, that He may honor faith by the bestowal of rich blessings. This is a means of advancing His work. But those who are without faith will never learn. By unbelief they dishonor their Lord. Unless they are converted, they will make shipwreck of their faith. They stand in the way of advancement, and this the Lord will not tolerate. He desires His people, even in the darkest shadow, to trust in Him.",
