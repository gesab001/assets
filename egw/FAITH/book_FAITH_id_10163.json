    "word": "FAITH CLAIMS THE BLESSING BEFORE IT IS REALIZED AND FELT.\u2014I have frequently seen that the children of the Lord neglect prayer, especially secret prayer, altogether too much; that many do not exercise that faith which it is their privilege and duty to exercise, often waiting for that feeling which faith alone can bring. Feeling is not faith; the two are distinct. Faith is ours to exercise, but joyful feeling and the blessing are God\u2019s to give. The grace of God comes to the soul through the channel of living faith, and that faith it is in our power to exercise.",
