    "word": "A man is received by God just as soon as he realizes that he has nothing in himself that will gain salvation. He must surrender himself as a willing servant to the One who gave His life to redeem him. When he loses all confidence in anything he has done or can do to save himself, when he gives himself up to be saved by Christ, he shows that he appreciates the sacrifice made in his behalf, that he has confidence to commit the keeping of his soul to God. Such a one can say in faith, \"I know that He will keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day.\"",
