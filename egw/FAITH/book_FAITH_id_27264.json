    "word": "My brethren and sisters, I ask you, in the name of the Lord, \n\n                               -315- \n\nto do all that you can to advance the work of the Berrien Springs school. I hope and pray that you will not become weary in well-doing. In carrying forward the work of selling \"Christ's Object Lessons\", you will receive a most precious blessing. As you show, this book to your friends and neighbors, telling them of the instruction that it contains and why you are trying to sell it, you will gain an experience that will enable you to do more successful work for the Master. As you take up this pleasing work--for such it will prove to all who take it up with faith and prayer--the peace of Christ will come into your hearts. The thought that you are doing a good work will fill you with joy and courage.",
