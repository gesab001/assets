    "word": "Oct. 30, 1894. \n\n                  Manner of Laboring. \n\n\n     Last night in my sleeping hours I seemed to be meeting with my brethren, listening to one who spoke as having authority. He said, \"Many souls will attend this meeting who are honestly ignorant of the truths which will be presented before them. They will listen and become interested, because Christ is drawing them; conscience tells them that what they hear is true, for it has the Bible for its foundation. The greatest care is needed in dealing with these souls. Be always on guard. Do not at the outset press before the people the most objectionable features of our faith, lest you close the ears of those to whom these things come as a new revelation.",
