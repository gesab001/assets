    "word": "All must see and understand their duty for themselves, after seeking wisdom from God. He is the only one to whom you may commit your soul for safe-keeping. If you come to Him in faith, he will speak His mysteries to you personally. You may sit together in heavenly places with Christ. We may individually understand God's will; we may know for ourselves what He would have us do; for He will direct us if we will consent to be consecrated and humble in heart before him. Our hearts will oft burn within us as One draws nigh to commune with us as He did with Enoch. \"Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge.\" We need Him who is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. \n\n\n                                    -382-",
