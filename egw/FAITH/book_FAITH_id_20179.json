    "word": "Examples of Good Works \n\n     All sanitarium workers, and parents, and ministers should realize their responsibility to God to be themselves patterns of what they desire the youth to become. \n                                                                           39\n\"For their sakes I sanctify Myself.\" Christ declared, \"that they also might be sanctified through the truth.\" So those to whom the youth look for direction and a godly example should sanctify themselves. Paul directed Timothy, \"Be thou an example of the believers.\" This is instruction to the workers in every institution. If they are learning of Christ daily, they will never forget how potent for good is the influence of right example. But if they are seeking only to amuse and please themselves, they set for themselves and for those within the range of their influence a low standard. Such a course can only end eventually in the yielding up of their faith.",
