    "word": "Thirty-five family tents were manufactured by some of the brethren, in advance, for the Conference. It was thought that these would meet all requirements. But as the orders came rolling in, more tents were purchased, and others were hired for the meeting. When completed, the camp had over one hundred tents, and five hundred and eleven people. The grounds were well laid out and faithfully cared for. Many of the tents were furnished with bedsteads, tables, chairs, and bureaus; and the whole camp was a model of cleanliness and good order.",
