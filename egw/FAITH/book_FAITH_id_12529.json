    "word": "1-5 (Matthew 22:14). A Few Faithful Ones in Sardis.--The church of Sardis is represented as having in it a few faithful ones among the many who had become, as it were, careless and insensible of their obligations to God. \"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.\" Who is so favored as to be numbered among these few in Sardis? Are you? Am I? Who are among this number? Is it not best for us to inquire into this matter, in order that we may learn to whom the Lord refers when He says that a few have not stained their white robes of character (MS 81, 1900)?",
