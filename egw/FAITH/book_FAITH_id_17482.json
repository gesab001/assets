{
    "word": "\"Abide in me\" are words of great significance. Abiding in Christ means a living, earnest, refreshing faith that works by love and purifies the soul. It means a constant receiving of the spirit of Christ, a life of unreserved surrender to His service. Where this union exists, good works will appear. The life of the vine will manifest itself in fragrant fruit on the branches. The continual supply of the grace of Christ will bless you and make you a blessing, till you can say with Paul, \"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me\" (Galatians 2:20).",
