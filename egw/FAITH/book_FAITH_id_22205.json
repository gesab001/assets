    "word": "Faith in God and a love for souls gives men a genuine motive for faithfulness. It leads them to work faithfully, that others may not be ruined by the example of unbelief which has ruined so many souls. Some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. Why? Because they failed to work diligently.--Ms 42, 1901, pp. 6, 7.
