    "word": "All these gifts are to be in exercise. Every faithful worker will minister for the perfecting of the saints. . . . There is something for everyone to do. Every soul that believes the truth is to stand in his lot and place, saying: \"Here am I; send me.\" . . . Give each one something to do for others. Help all to see that as receivers of the grace of Christ they are under obligation to work for Him. And let all be taught how to work. Especially should those who are newly come to the faith be educated to become laborers together with God. If set to work, the despondent will soon forget their despondency; the weak will become strong, the ignorant intelligent, and all will be prepared to present the truth as it is in Jesus. They will find an unfailing helper in Him who has promised to save all that come unto Him.",
