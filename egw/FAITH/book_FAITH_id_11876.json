    "word": "Confidence Assailed \n\n     The enemy will set everything in operation to uproot the confidence of the believers in the pillars of our faith in the messages of the past, which have placed us upon the elevated platform of eternal truth, and which have established and given character to the work. The Lord God of Israel has led out His people, unfolding to them truth of heavenly origin. His voice has been heard, and is still heard, saying, \"Go forward from strength to strength, from grace to grace, from glory to glory.\" The work is strengthening and broadening, for the Lord God of Israel is the defense of His people.",
