    "word": "My dear brethren and sisters, Christ is now saying to you: \"Lift up your eyes and look on this Southern field; for it needs workers--sowers of the seed, and reapers. It needs your means for the maintenance of these workers.\" The grace of Christ is unlimited, it is God's free gift. Then why should not this neglected people have some hope and courage and faith brought into their lives? There is sunshine in the heart for all who will accept Christ. \n     September, 1907.",
