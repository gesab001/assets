    "word": "Will you please study the things I present before you? Will you consider that Satan is a vigilant, untiring foe, and he sleeps not. He knows that his time is short, and he will work until the end with every species of deception to draw souls into his snare and ruin them. I have a message for you, \"Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\" Give no place to the devil to stand between you and Christ, lest you savor of the things that be of men and not of God. If your faith is genuine it must and will produce obedience. God commands us to do nothing which we cannot do. He will give strength to every believing, trusting soul. Keep Christ with you in the vessel, and you will be safe. The ship may be tossed on the white-capped billows ever so fiercely, the restless sea may heave and the waves roll beneath her, yet Jesus is on board.",
