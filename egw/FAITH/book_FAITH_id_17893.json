    "word": "In our connection with any line of God's work, we must use the sacred fire. Supposed human ability and efficiency is common fire, but this is unacknowledged by God. A decided position must be maintained upon the high platform of eternal truth. The time has come when all who work in Christ's lines will have the mark of God, in words, in spirit, in character, in their honor of Immanuel. While so many of our people have been hovering about the mystery of faith and godliness, they could have solved the matter by proclaiming, \"I know that Christ is my portion forever. His mercy, His gentleness hath made me great.\" . . .",
