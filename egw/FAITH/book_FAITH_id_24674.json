    "word": "Christ is called the minister of the true tabernacle. He is the head of His church on earth. He declares, \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" (Matthew 28:18-20). He is the minister of the true tabernacle, and He is constantly sending messages to His people. The rich nutriment of sound doctrine will be given to all true laborers. Christ's faithful ambassadors will be taught of God in every sermon that speaks truth to the heart. Christ is indeed the minister of holy things in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man.",
