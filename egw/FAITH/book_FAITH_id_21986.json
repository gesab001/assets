    "word": "The question will come up, How is it? Is it by conditions that we receive salvation?--Never by conditions that we come to Christ. And if we come to Christ, then what is the condition?

But when God is calling the sinner in our world, and inviting him, there is no condition there; he draws by the invitation of Christ, and it is not, Now you have got to respond in order to come to God. The sinner comes, and as he comes and views Christ elevated upon that cross of Calvary, which God impresses upon his mind, there is a love beyond anything that is imagined that he has taken hold of. . . .",
