    "word": "Though Christ endured sorrow which no pen can portray, he did not shrink from the payment of the ransom for lost man. Let the minister and missionary look upon his example of faith and perseverance. Of him it is written: \"He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth.\" You are not to grow weary in well-doing, but to be of good courage in the work of God. It was love that sustained \n                                                                           21\nChrist in his humiliation, love for perishing souls that enabled him to endure the insults, the contempt, the rejection of men, and at last led him to die on Calvary, that whosoever believeth on him might not perish, but have everlasting life. The salvation of the lost was the object of Christ's mission to earth, and he died to redeem sinners of every race and every clime. We are to be laborers together with him; for as long as there are sinners to be saved, so long are the followers of Christ to deny self, to work intelligently, to go forth into the highways and by-ways, showing forth the praises of Him who hath called them out of darkness into his marvellous light. Christ calls upon all who have discerned the merits of his sacrifice and character to make known the wonders of redeeming love to those who know it not. He would have us bear with others as he has borne with us in our perversity, in our backslidings; for he has not cast us off in our waywardness, but has forgiven our transgressions, and clothed us with the robe of his righteousness, drawing us to himself by the cords of his love.",
