    "word": "If Christ is not abiding in the soul, another spirit rules and controls; but Christ, the precious Saviour, is to be the Christian's all in all. Every holy thought, every pure desire, every godlike purpose is from him who is the light, the truth, and the way. Christ is to live in his representatives by the spirit of truth. Jesus said, \"Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.\" The events of the future will be discerned by prophecy, and will be understood. \"He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you.\" Christ is to live in the human instrument. Paul says, \"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.\" \n                                                                           1056",
