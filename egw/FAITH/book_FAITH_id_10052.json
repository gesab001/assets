    "word": "PREVIOUSLY UNPUBLISHED MATERIAL FROM THE PEN OF ELLEN WHITE IS ALWAYS EXCITING TO DISCOVER. SINCE MANY OF THE FOLLOWING SELECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN READILY AVAILABLE TO PARENTS AND TEACHERS, THE READER WILL BE DELIGHTED TO SEE NEW CONCEPTS AND EMPHASES GIVEN TO BASIC PROBLEMS IN THE AREAS OF PARENTING AND TEACHING. SUCH TOPICS AS DISCIPLINE, HOME EDUCATION, AND INSTILLING IMAGINATIVE RELIGIOUS FAITH IN CHILDREN ARE DEALT WITH IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES PRACTICAL, USABLE GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS PERSONAL INSPIRATION. OF COURSE, NO STUDY OF CHRISTIAN GROWTH WOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE WITHOUT THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES CHAPTER ON 2 PETER 1, WHICH IS REPRINTED HERE FOR THE READER'S CONVENIENCE.",
