I am glad; yes, I am so thankful that some are beginning to see that there is light for them. I was glad to hear Brother Larson's testimony yesterday. Now there is light for us. If we want to stay in the cellar, we can do it; but the only way for anyone of us is to fight the good fight of faith. It is not anything that is going to come naturally; but we have got to fight the good fight of faith instead of absorbing all the filth of unbelief. If it is a suggestion of unbelief, credence is given to that at once. You will never have greater light and evidence than you have had here; if you wait till the judgment, what you have had here will condemn you. But God has been speaking and His power has been in our midst, and if you have not evidences enough to show you where and how God is working, you never will have it. You will have to gather up the rays of light that you have had, and not question so. \"But there are some things that are not explained.\" Well, what if everything is not explained? Where is the weight of evidence? God will balance the mind if it is susceptible for the influence of the Spirit of God; if it is not, then it will decide on the other side. They will come just exactly where Judas came; they will sell their Lord for thirty pieces of silver or something else. They will sacrifice everything to unbelief.",
