    "word": "Those who do not feel that it is a positive duty to be doers of the words of Christ, continually put souls in peril by their rash words and actions. But, my children, I counsel you to walk in humility. Do not let the impulses and freaks that seem to possess some of those who profess to believe the truth, discourage you. Look unto Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith. If you will trust in Him, He can make you strong.",
