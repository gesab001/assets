    "word": "We need much more of the presence and power of God, and it is waiting our demand upon it. Cultivate faith and fervency in prayer. The Lord Jesus loves us, and pleads for us. His Holy Spirit works within us. When trials come, utter no word of complaint. Let not a murmuring thought enter the soul. Jesus, the precious Saviour, loves us with a love that is infinite. Oh, talk of Jesus, meditate upon Jesus, and by beholding Him, we shall become changed into His character.",
