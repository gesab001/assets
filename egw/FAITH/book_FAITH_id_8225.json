    "word": "Transgression Brought No New Order of Energies and Passions.--We are not to suppose that since the transgression of Adam, God has given to human beings a new order of energies and passions, for then it would appear that God had interfered to implant in the human race sinful propensities. Christ began His work of conversion as soon as man transgressed, that through obedience to the law of God and faith in Christ they might regain the lost image of God.--MS 60, 1905.",
