    "word": "The words addressed to Timothy are addressed to all ministers; and would it not be well if they would become doers of these words? Paul says, \"The things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\" The instruction given to Timothy was deemed of great importance, and not to be lost, but was to be communicated to faithful men who would disseminate the light and spread abroad a knowledge of the principles of truth.",
