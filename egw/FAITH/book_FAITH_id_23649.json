    "word": "The lessons of Christ in the parables preceding the parable of the vineyard present the Jewish nation as unfaithful in their stewardship. Men of God's appointment had come to the vineyard for fruit, and had found none. Christ compared them to the barren fig tree, which while laden with luxuriant foliage and apparently flourishing, was destitute of fruit. Christ searched from the topmost branch to the lowest bough, but He found nothing but leaves, and He cursed the unfruitful tree. \"Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward forever,\" He said.",
