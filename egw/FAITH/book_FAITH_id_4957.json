    "word": "Bible Study\n     The perusal of works upon our faith, the reading of arguments from the pen of others, while an excellent and important practice, is not that which will give the mind the greatest strength. The Bible is the best book in the world for intellectual culture. The subjects treated upon in the word of God, the dignified simplicity of its utterances, the grand themes which it presents to the mind, tend to develop in man faculties which cannot otherwise be developed. The student will come from a contemplation of these elevating themes, from associations with these lofty thoughts, more pure and elevated in mind than if he had been occupied in the contemplation of any subject of a merely human origin.",
