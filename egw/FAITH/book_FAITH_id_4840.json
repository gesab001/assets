    "word": "Ministers should speak in a manner to reach and impress the people. The teachings of Christ were impressive and solemn; his voice was melodious. And should not we, as well as Christ, study to have melody in our voices? He had a mighty influence, for he was the Son of God. We are so far beneath him and so far deficient, that, do the very best we can, our efforts will be poor. We cannot gain and hold the influence that he had; but why should we not educate ourselves to come just as near to the Pattern as it is possible for us to do, that we may have the greatest possible influence upon the people? Our words, our actions, our deportment, our dress, \u2014everything should preach. Not only with our words should we speak to the people, but everything \n152\npertaining to our person should be a sermon to them, that right impressions may be made upon them, and that the truth spoken may be taken by them to their homes. Thus our faith will stand in a better light before the community.",
