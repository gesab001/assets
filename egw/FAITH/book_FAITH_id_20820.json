    "word": "A Word to the Discouraged. \n\n     Many are so sad and discouraged, so weak in faith and trust, that they can not appropriate to themselves the rich promises of God. Let them, then, do something to help some one more needy than themselves, and they will grow strong in God's strength. Let them engage in the good work of selling our books and distributing our papers and tracts. Thus they will help others, and they will gain an experience that will give them the assurance that they are God's helping hand. As they plead with the Lord to help them, He will guide them to those who are seeking for the light.",
