    "word": "You cannot have faith that the Lord will keep you by His lovingkindness, and by His truth continually preserve you, when you do not place yourselves in the channel of light. Then shun bad companions, and choose the good. The seed of truth sown in the heart must receive the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness in order to grow. The seeds of truth which do not spring up and grow, soon lose their power to germinate, and they perish. But weeds of evil habits will spring up and flourish. The precious plants of love, joy, patience, courtesy, meekness, and humility, need to be carefully cultivated if they grow and improve.",
