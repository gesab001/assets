    "word": "Men have turned away from the warnings given, and are being deceived through the influence of mind over mind, and the results are most deplorable. One sinner, under the influence of the enemy's deceptions, can work untold harm. Oh, how many souls have had their faith ruined and their confidence spoiled by the protestations of belief in the Testimonies, uttered by those who for years have shown positive disbelief in them. I was relieved when some who had been making these protestations decided that the time has come to take an open stand [against them]. I felt relieved, because minds will not now be captivated by assurance after assurance that they believe the Testimonies.",
