    "word": "But the people of God are asleep to their present and eternal good. The Lord says to them, \u201cArise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\u201d He desires them to go to work in unity, in faith, and love. He desires that the work of reformation shall begin in the home, with the fathers and mothers, and then the church will realize the Holy Spirit\u2019s working. The influence of this work will go through the church like leaven. Fathers and mothers need converting. They have not educated themselves to mold and fashion the characters of their children aright.",
