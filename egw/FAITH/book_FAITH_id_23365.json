    "word": "In Newcastle and Maitland, places about 20 miles from Cooranbong, considerable work has been done in canvassing. Now there is an interest to hear the truth, and yet no labor has been given in [a] tent effort. There are also small towns between Morissett and Sydney, where there has been no labor.
