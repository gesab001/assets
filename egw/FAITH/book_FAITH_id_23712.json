    "word": "Newcastle, N.S.W., March 17, 1899. \n     Sister Sara McEnterfer accompanied me to Newcastle on this morning's train. I am writing in the mission home, where Brother and Sister Starr live. Both are doing their best to advance the cause of truth. The interest continues to be good, and we have faith that a large number will take their stand for the truth. Twelve or fifteen will be baptized next Sunday. How far this interest extends we know not, but the citizens who are not believers say that the whole community is stirred.",
