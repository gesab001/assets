    "word": "We come to God in the name of Jesus by special invitation, and He welcomes us to His audience chamber. He imparts to the humble, contrite soul that faith in Christ by which he is justified. Jesus blots out as a thick cloud his transgression, and the comforted heart exclaims, \"O Lord, I will praise Thee: though Thou wast angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortedst me.\" Isaiah 12:1. Such a one will understand by his own experience the words of Paul, \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\" Romans 10:10.",
