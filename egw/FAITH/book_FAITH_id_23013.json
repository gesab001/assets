    "word": "MR No. 976 - God the Source of All Wisdom\n\n     Thinking for Oneself--Many are changed by every current. They wait to hear what someone else thinks, and his opinion is accepted as altogether true. If they would lean wholly upon God, they would grow strong in His strength; but they do not say to the Lord, \"I cannot make any decision until I know Thy will.\" Their natural inclination is to allow another to be conscience for them and think for them, and they speak after he has spoken, saying what he says and acting as he acts. When these persons are placed in circumstances where they must think and act for themselves, they dare not express any settled opinion. God pity such weaklings; and yet often, like Aaron, they have much ability.--Ms. 121, 1898. (\"An Example of Faithfulness,\" Oct. 2, 1898.)",
