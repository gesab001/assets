    "word": "Oh, how blind you have been, how unworthy the name of Christian! Your spirit is not in harmony with the Spirit of Christ. You think too much of yourself. You are spiritually blind. The feelings you cherish in reference to the faithful sisters of the church are more satanic than divine. You have united with some others in cherishing feelings that were all wrong. If you only had as much piety, perseverance, earnestness, and steadfast energy as has been manifested by these humble, devoted women who have the benefit of your sneers, \n\n\n                                     -56- \n\nyou would have been in a far better condition spiritually. But such feelings as you have had are displeasing to God and those who have united with you.",
