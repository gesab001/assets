    "word": "The appointment of the seven was greatly blessed of God. The church advanced in numbers and strength, \"and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" This success was due both to the greater freedom secured to the apostles, and to the zeal and power manifested by the seven deacons. The fact that these brethren had been ordained for a special work, did not exclude them from teaching the faith. On the contrary, they were fully qualified to instruct in the truth, and they engaged in the work with great earnestness and success.",
