    "word": "One is our Master, even Christ. We have pledged ourselves to live to His name's glory. God grant that the veil that separates us from Him may be drawn aside, and that we may accept him as our Companion and Teacher. We are not to look upon ourselves as gods, able to carry out our own will, our own devising. We are to remember that in order to be successful in our work, we must be sustained by God, we must have the power that Christ gives to all who believe in Him--the power to become the sons of God. We are faithfully to discharge the duties enjoined on us in the Word of God, shunning everything that would make us in character like the arch-deceiver. \n                                       (Signed) Ellen G. White. \n\n\n                               -301-",
