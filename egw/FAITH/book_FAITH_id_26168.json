    "word": "A physician needs to have a very close connection with God. Never is he to lose his hold of God's helpful, strengthening power. He is to drink deeply of the water of life, and then lead others to the living stream. The fact that the physician acts so important a part in bringing relief from suffering will naturally place him where he will be regarded with feelings of love and gratitude by those whom he has helped. Let him not take the praise and glory to himself. Let him hide self in the Saviour, pointing to Christ as the One who is to receive all praise and thanksgiving. The Lord is the worker: the physician is only the instrument. \"Without me,\" Christ declares, \"ye can do nothing.\" He says to the faithful physician, I will stand by your side, and as you tell those for whom you work that Christ is all and in all, that He died for your sins, in order that they should not perish, but have everlasting life, it will impress their hearts.",
