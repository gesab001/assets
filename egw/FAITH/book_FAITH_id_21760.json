    "word": "Love to Sister Eastman and Brother Gardner. Should love to see you all. Pray for me. I have trials that none but God knows of, but I have started for eternal life and I cannot stop this side. I must see the inside of glory, stagger not at the promise but believe. Faith, simple faith is what we want, a firm reliance and trust in God. Faith will drive back the powers of darkness; only have faith and you will have a clear, sweet atmosphere to live and breathe in. \n\n\n                                    -326-",
