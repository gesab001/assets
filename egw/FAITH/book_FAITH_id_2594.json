    "word": "Then let us be diligent in the distribution of literature that has been carefully prepared for use among those not of our faith. Let us make the most of every opportunity to arrest the attention of unbelievers. Let us put literature into every hand that will receive it. Let us consecrate ourselves to the proclamation of the message, \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God!\" Divine and human instrumentalities are to unite for the accomplishment of one great object. Now is the day of our responsibility. \"The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.--MS 2, 1914.",
