    "word": "The Father hears every prayer of His contrite children. The voice of supplication from the earth unites with the voice of our Intercessor who pleads in heaven, whose voice the Father always hears. Let our prayers therefore continually ascend to God. Let them not come up in the name of any human being, but in the name of Him who is our Substitute and Surety. Christ has given us His name to use. He says, \"Ask in My name.\" Let us pray in faith. Let us not falter, but go forward from strength to strength, from character to character, from victory to victory.",
