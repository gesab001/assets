    "word": "This instruction is given to us all. Ministers are to take heed, and with pen and voice echo the words of God. When we are called upon to violate the law of God, we shall be given wisdom from above, to answer as did Christ, \"It is written.\" Speak as few words of your own arrangement as possible, but have your heart supplied with the sharp arrows of God's furnishing. If God, the great Master Workman, is with us, we shall pass through the perplexing ordeals before us as firm as a rock to principle, obeying God rather than man. This attitude \n\n\n                                    -195- \n\nwill bring victories which our lack of faith has led us to regard as hopeless and impossible. These definite instructions were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.",
