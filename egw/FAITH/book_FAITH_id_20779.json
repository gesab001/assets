[EXTRACTS FROM \n              TESTIMONY NO. 32.] \n\n     While the doubting ones talk of impossibilities, while they tremble at the thought of high walls and strong giants, let the faithful Calebs, who have \"another spirit,\" come to the front. The truth of God, which bringeth salvation, will go forth to the people, if ministers and professed believers will not hedge up its way, as did the unfaithful spies.",
