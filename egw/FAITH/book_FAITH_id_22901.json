    "word": "MR No. 915 - Work the Cities While There is Time\n\n     Our faith is small. We need more earnestness in prayer. A heaven full of blessings awaits our demand. These blessings will be given in answer to the fervent, effectual prayer that asks with an earnestness that will not be denied. The firm hold of a wrestling Jacob is called for now. The holding power of unquestioning faith needs to come into the lives of God's people. God's work needs men who will say, \"I will not let Thee go except Thou bless me.\" It needs men who will consecrate themselves unreservedly to God. Genuine, earnest faith will prepare the heart for the reception of God's power.",
