    "word": "The influence of the prayer of faith is as far reaching as eternity. The Lord will bless all who will seek Him with the whole heart, and who with humble souls and earnest purpose strive to follow the example of Christ. To those who thus seek to become partakers of the divine nature, the words are spoken, \"Be not weary in well doing\" (2 Thessalonians 3:13). \"Always abounding in the work of the Lord\" (1 Corinthians 15:58). Let us beware lest self-sufficiency become mingled with our efforts to gain eternal life.",
