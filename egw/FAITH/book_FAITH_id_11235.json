    "word": "While the Lord has not promised His people exemption from trials, He has promised that which is far better. He has said, \"As thy days, so shall thy strength be\" (Deuteronomy 33:25). . . . If you are called to go through the fiery furnace for His sake, Jesus will be by your side even as He was with the faithful three in Babylon. Those who love their Redeemer will rejoice at every opportunity of sharing with Him humiliation and reproach. The love they bear their Lord makes suffering for His sake sweet. . . .",
