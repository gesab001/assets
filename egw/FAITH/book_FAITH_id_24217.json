    "word": "In the Scriptures we have the life of Christ before us--a living example in vital, spiritual action. His ministry was marked with keenness of perception. He was always true. His life evidenced inward spirituality. In the name of the Lord God of Israel, I would say that those who are partakers of the divine nature will have spiritual life and light with which to bless others. \"He that heareth My word,\" saith Christ, \"and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life.\" It is not an inactive faith, but a living, working faith, that enables us to be successful laborers together with God.",
