    "word": "And through our canvassers the truth will reach those who can not be reached in any other way,\u2014 those living far away from any large settlement. I call these the byway hearers. To such ones our canvassers are to be God's evangelists, going from house to house, and opening the Scriptures to those whom they meet. They will find many who are willing and anxious to know what is truth. Much has been accomplished by the faithful canvassers who have gone from place to place, bearing with them books containing the light of present truth. Through their efforts entire families have been won to the truth.",
