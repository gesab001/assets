For in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succour them that are tempted\" (Hebrews 2:17, 18). Reconciliation means that every barrier between the soul and God is removed, and that the sinner realizes what the pardoning love of God means. By reason of the sacrifice made by Christ for fallen men, God can justly pardon the transgressor who accepts the merits of Christ. Christ was the channel through which the mercy, love, and righteousness might flow from the heart of God to the heart of the sinner. \"He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9). . . .",
