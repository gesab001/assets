    "word": "Faith and Obedience \n\n     Said Christ, \"If any man serve Me, him will My Father honor.\" When we come to Him we should pray that we might enter into and accomplish His purpose, and that our desires and interests might be lost in His. We should acknowledge our acceptance of His will, not praying Him to concede to ours. It is better for us that God does not always answer our prayers just when we desire and in just the manner we wish. He will do more and better for us than to accomplish all our wishes; for our wisdom is folly.",
