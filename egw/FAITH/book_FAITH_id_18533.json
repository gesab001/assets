    "word": "We, living far down the passage of ages, have the privilege of studying the Old Testament in connection with the New. Our faith and courage should be strong as we see prophecies fulfilling. But how many there are who are unbelieving.

How many home circles are broken because the members receive and act upon Satan's suggestions.",
