    "word": "In this scene is a representation of what those will do who stand under the black banner of the powers of darkness, and what will be the spirit of those whom we shall have to meet in the great crisis that is before us. If Christ had told the disciples all the details of these scenes of cruelty, they would not have comprehended them. Today we need greater faith in order that we may stand the test and the trial that is before us. Let us pray that the Lord will increase our faith.--Letter 59, 1895. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. June 16, 1988. Entire Letter.",
