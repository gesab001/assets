    "word": "Godliness, which the gospel enjoins, never bears briars and thorns, never--because all do not see exactly alike--breaks the closest links of association, dividing those who have been one in faith, one in heart, in their relationship. But a difference in the application of some few scriptural passages makes men forget their religious principles. Elements become banded together, exciting one another through the human passions to withstand in a harsh, denunciatory manner everything that does not meet their ideas. This is not Christian, but is of another spirit.-- Manuscript 30, 1889, pp. 26,27. (\"Experience Following the Minneapolis Conference,\" cir. late June, 1890.)",
