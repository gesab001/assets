    "word": "Our Saviour bids us, \"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\" Mark 14:38. If we encounter difficulties, and in Christ's strength overcome them; if we meet enemies, and in Christ's strength put them to flight; if we accept responsibilities, and in Christ's strength discharge them faithfully, we are gaining a precious experience. We learn, as we could not otherwise have learned, that our Saviour is a present help in every time of need.",
