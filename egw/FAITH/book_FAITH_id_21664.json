Their abstinence from the prescribed bill of fare made a distinction in every way between their appearance and the appearance of those \n\n\n                                    -124- \n\nyouth who indulged their appetite. There were plenty to make remarks, but these youth were faithful even in little things. And in physical appearance they were far ahead of the youth who sat at the king's table.

They were better prepared physically for taxing labor; for they were never sick. With clear minds, they could think and work vigorously. By obeying God they were doing the very things that will give strength of thought and memory.-- Ms 47, 1898, pp. 4, 5. (\"The Echo Office and Commercial Work,\" March 31, 1898.)",
