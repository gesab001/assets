    "word": "Then will any one run the risk of withholding from God His own, doing as did the unfaithful servant who hid His Lord's money in the earth? Shall we, as did this man, seek to justify our unfaithfulness by complaining of God, saying, \"Lord, I knew Thee that Thou art an hard man, reaping where Thou hast not sown, and gathering where Thou hast not strawed: and I was afraid, and went and hid Thy talent in the earth: lo, there Thou hast that is Thine?\" Shall we not rather present our gratitude offerings to God?--The Youth's Instructor, August 26, 1897.",
