    "word": "Whatever may be the needed discipline of the church militant amid the dragon's wrath against those who keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus, the benediction is pronounced upon all who love and obey God.

The Alpha and Omega does not utter words that will lead any soul to suppose that a profession of faith without willing, genuine love and obedience, will secure to him the entrance into the Holy City and a right to the tree of life. The Lord declares, \"This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth, and honoreth Me with their lips; but their heart is far from Me\" [Matthew 15:8]. This is mockery to God, speaking with a mouth of guile.",
