    "word": "In this age of error, of daydreaming and reverie, we need to learn the first principles of the doctrine of Christ. Let us strive to be able to say with the apostle, \"We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" 2 Peter 1:16. The Lord calls upon us to follow high and noble principles. We must let the principles of the third angel's message stand out clear and distinct. The great pillars of our faith will hold all the weight that can be placed upon them. Young men must be educated to keep within the bounds of \"It is written.\" Paul writes, \"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears. And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\" That time has come. I present the word of warning: \"Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry\" [2 Timothy 4:1-5].--Ms 82, 1894. \n\n\n                                     -31-",
