    "word": "Word came by letter to us from Oakland that special seasons of prayer were being held in my behalf, that the Lord would heal me of my sickness and that I should be able to bear my testimony before the congregation assembled in the camp meeting at Oakland. I tried to make some effort to respond. I tried to walk out by faith as I had done in the past. A bed was made for me on the seats of the car and I lay down until we changed for the boat. I was strengthened to reach the Mission in Oakland, and although weak and trembling I was strengthened to bear my testimony in the congregation several times.",
