{"word": "The Tongue Is Loosened.--When these tea and coffee users meet together for social entertainment, the effects of their pernicious habit are manifest. All partake freely of the favorite beverages, and as the stimulating influence is felt, their tongues are loosened, and they begin the wicked work of talking against others. Their words are not few or well chosen. The tidbits of gossip are passed around, too often the poison of scandal as well. These thoughtless gossipers forget that they have a witness. An unseen Watcher is writing their words in the books of heaven. All these unkind criticisms, these exaggerated reports, these envious feelings, expressed under the excitement of the cup of tea, Jesus registers as against Himself. \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\"-- Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, page 36.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 79}
