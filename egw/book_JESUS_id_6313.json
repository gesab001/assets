{"word": "Oh that I could impress upon all the necessity of laboring in the spirit of Jesus; for I have been shown that souls here in Europe have been turned away from the truth because of a lack of tact and skill in presenting it. In kindness and love seek to instruct those who oppose you. Preach the truth with the meekness of simplicity, remembering that it is not your words but the word of God which is to cut its way to the heart. There is danger, even in laboring among our churches, of leaving the great principles of truth and dwelling too much upon small, unimportant matters that create a fault-finding spirit among brethren. There are always those in the church and out who have not the love of Jesus in their souls, and who have, in the place of true religion, a criticising, exacting spirit, a desire to find something to condemn in their brethren and sisters. Such ones grasp eagerly at this kind of labor; but they do more harm than good, and should not be encouraged.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 122}
