{"word": "(Hebrews 6:19; 8:6, 7; Hebrews 10:19, 20.) God's Presence Withdrawn From Earthly Sanctuary.--By the rending of the veil of the temple, God said, I can no longer reveal My presence in the most holy place. A new and living Way, before which there hangs no veil, is offered to all. No longer need sinful, sorrowing humanity await the coming of the high priest.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1109}
