{"word": "Message on Matthew 9:28-30--My text was Matthew 9:28-30. The congregation were, many of them, intelligent men and women. I presented the truth in its simplicity, that old and young could understand. This was the manner of Jesus' preaching. He taught the people in simplicity. He used no large words that the unlearned could not understand. The unlearned, the veriest child, could understand His words.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 400}
