{"word": "Children will learn to love that which the parents love. Those who would interest their sons and daughters in Bible truth, must themselves feel an interest in Bible truth and Bible study. If we desire our children to love and reverence God, we must talk of his goodness, his majesty, and his power. If we would have them love and imitate the character of Christ, we must not only tell them of the sacrifice which he made for our redemption, of the love, humility, and self-denial manifested in his life on earth, but we must show them that this is the pattern which we are striving to follow. If we desire to engage their hearts in the cause and work of God, we must teach them to sacrifice for it. That which costs little we have no special interest in, but that in which we have invested our means will claim our interest and attention, and we shall labor to make it a success. Parents, make religion the vital question of life. Teach your children that every worldly consideration should be made secondary to their eternal interests.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 285}
