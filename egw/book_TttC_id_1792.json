    "word": "Has the injunction of the apostle no force in this age: \"Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares\"? I am daily pained with exhibitions of selfishness among our people. There is an alarming absence of love and care for those who are entitled to it. Our heavenly Father lays blessings disguised in our pathway, but some will not touch these for fear they will detract from their enjoyment. Angels are waiting to see if we embrace opportunities within our reach of doing good--waiting to see if we will bless others, that they in their turn may bless us. The Lord Himself has made us to differ,--some poor, some rich, some afflicted,--that all may have an opportunity to develop character. The poor are purposely permitted to be thus of God, that we may be tested and proved, and develop what is in our hearts.",
