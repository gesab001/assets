    "word": "In your last two discussions you despised counsel and would not listen to God's servant, whose whole soul was devoted to the work. God in His providence provided you an adviser whose talents and influence entitled him to your respect and confidence, and it could in no way have injured your dignity to be guided by his experienced judgment. God's angels marked your self-sufficiency and with grief turned from you. He could not safely display His power in your behalf, for you would have taken the glory to yourself, and your future labors would have been of but little value. I saw, Brother F, that you should not, in your labors, lean upon your own judgment, which has so often led you astray. You should yield to the judgment of those of experience. Do not \n                                                                           627\nstand upon your own dignity and feel so self-sufficient that you cannot take the advice and counsel of experienced fellow laborers.",
