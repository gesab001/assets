{"word": "Good Deeds Promote Health.--Good deeds are twice a blessing, benefiting both the giver and the receiver of the kindness. The consciousness of rightdoing is one of the best medicines for diseased bodies and minds. When the mind is free and happy from a sense of duty well done and the satisfaction of giving happiness to others, the cheering, uplifting influence brings new life to the whole being.--MH 257 (1905).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 405}
