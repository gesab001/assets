    "word": "Brother A B, a record of the sad history you are making is kept in heaven. In heart you are at war with the testimonies of reproof. The E family have been, and are still, deceived in you. Others are more or less perplexed because you can talk well on present truth. Harmony and unity do not exist in the church at -----. You have not received and acted upon the light given you. Had you heeded the words of Solomon you would not today be found standing in such a slippery path. He says: \"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\" Entire submission to the will and ways of God, united with deep distrust of your own wisdom, would have led you in a safer path.",
