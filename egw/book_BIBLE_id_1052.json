{"word": "Better Lose Position Than Jesus.--Do not think that if you take your position for the Bible truth you will lose your position. You had better lose your  position than lose Jesus. You had better be partakers of the self-denial and self-sacrifice of the Lord than to go in your own way seeking to gather to yourself the treasures of this life. You cannot carry any of it into the grave. You will come up from the grave \n                                                                           244\nwithout anything, but if you have Jesus you will have everything. He is all that you will require to stand the test of the day of God, and is not this enough for you?--Manuscript 20, 1894.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 243}
