    "word": "YOUTH TO PRAY DAILY FOR WISDOM AND GRACE.\u2014The trials and privations of which so many youth complain, Christ endured without murmuring. And this discipline is the very experience the youth need, which will give firmness to their characters, and make them like Christ, strong in spirit to resist temptation. They will not, if they separate from the influence of those who would lead them astray and corrupt their morals, be overcome by the devices of Satan. Through daily prayer to God, they will have wisdom and grace from Him to bear the conflict and stern realities of life, and come off victorious. Fidelity and serenity of mind can only be retained by watchfulness and prayer. Christ\u2019s life was an example of persevering energy, which was not allowed to become weakened by reproach, ridicule, privation or hardships.",
