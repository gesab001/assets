    "word": "-93- \n\n     We hear much talk about faith. We want faith that amounts to something. What we need is faith that works. And how does it work? By love. And what does it do? It purifies, sanctifies, the soul. As we look to the cross erected on Calvary, love takes possession of the soul. It brings the will of man into subjection to God. \"If ye love Me, keep My commandments.\" These words are from the lips of the divine Teacher, and He further promises, \"And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless\" (John 14:15-18).",
