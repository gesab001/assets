    "word": "Satan strives to bring into the church envy, suspicion, and evil-surmisings. We are hoping and praying that the church may be purged from this evil, and that the compassion of Christ may be kindled in every heart. Christ has left us an example, that we should follow in His steps. He always drew near to the most needy, the most hopeless, and, attracted by His sympathy, they came close to Him. He assures every suffering, needy, sinful soul that he will never want for a great Physician to give him spiritual help. We stand too far away from suffering humanity. Let us draw nearer to Christ, that our souls may be filled with His grace, and with a desire to give this grace to others.",
