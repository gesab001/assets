    "word": "You have been talking too much of your profits, and have not been talking of God and His love and His power, and His influence is not in your hearts. By praying to Him for living faith, we become conformed to Him. All seams are to be brushed away from our brows, and our eyes are no longer to look dim; the love of God will be seen in our expression, and we shall be with the angels of God, in a little way from this. Then elevate the life, elevate the character, elevate the love of Jesus, and talk of heaven and the goodness of God.",
