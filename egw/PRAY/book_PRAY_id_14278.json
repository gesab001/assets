    "word": "Just put your trust in Jesus and remember that you are suffering for His sake, and that He will not leave nor forsake you. Have faith in God. Our prayers are going up daily to God in your behalf. We will have special care for your wife and child. Those who have put you in prison have done an unjust thing. If they had known you and been acquainted with your work, instead of enclosing you in prison walls they would have sent you two throughout the length and breadth of the domain, telling you to proclaim to all people, to all subjects and to all tongues, that there is a living God, that there is salvation for the sinner.",
