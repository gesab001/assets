    "word": "Yesterday (Sabbath) morning, Willie spoke to the church in Ashfield. At 3 p.m. we hired a horse and carriage to take me to Newtown, four miles from Ashfield. We met in a small hall upstairs where a goodly number were assembled. I spoke to them on the prayer of Daniel, his contrition of soul, and his deep sorrow as he witnessed the desolation of Jerusalem.",
