    "word": "I think in the meetings held in Grimsby that there should be Bible lessons given in the place of many discourses. There should be visiting from house to house to get at the people. Pray with them, talk with them, and, above everything else, I hope those who labor will plead with God for His Holy Spirit. This is what is needed. There is the Salvation Army, the Holiness Band with their cheap Christianity, and yet it pleases because there is no warfare. They present all smooth sailing. The truth brings before the people heart religion. It is not, they will say, who are in error [or] the works we do, but it is what Jesus does for us. This is all true, but our works must be like the works of Christ. Now, if God works by His power, the hearts of all must feel it. This, then, is the way to reach the people, through God. Be in earnest, agonize in prayer, and you will see the salvation of God.",
