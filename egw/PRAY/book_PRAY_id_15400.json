    "word": "(135) Pray much, and practise self-denial, that you may help in establishing the sanitarium at Glendale, which is struggling to make a beginning. Seek to make it an institution after God's order. Some can do more than others, but all can do something. There are those who, if they will deny self, may do much more than they have done, and if all will take hold in earnest the Glendale Sanitarium may be made a praise in the earth.",
