    "word": "During the week of prayer I visited Newcastle accompanied by Miss Sara McEnterfer. We made our home with Elder Haskell and his wife. They have just hired a large brick house at Wallsend on which is painted in large letters, \"Empire Clothing House.\" It is a two-story building with good stable. It has no spare grounds; the house, barn, and outdoor kitchen occupy all the space. The owners promised that if Elder Haskell would take the place for one year they would put it in good order. It has quite a number of rooms and can be secured for ten shillings per week, $2.50 American currency.",
