    "word": "Chapter 14 \u2014Daily Prayer\n\nAS ESSENTIAL AS OUR DAILY FOOD.\u2014If we would develop a character which God can accept, we must form correct habits in our religious life. Daily prayer is as essential to growth in grace, and even to spiritual life itself, as is temporal food to physical wellbeing. We should accustom ourselves to often lift the thoughts to God in prayer. If the mind wanders, we must bring it back; by persevering effort, habit will finally make it easy. We cannot for one moment separate ourselves from Christ with safety. We may have His presence to attend us at every step, but only by observing the conditions which He has Himself laid down.\u2014(Messages to Young People, 114, 115.)",
