    "word": "Whoever feels that he needs a firmer hold upon God, whoever desires to be separated from his natural and cultivated tendencies to evil, let him take his stand here for God today. I ask those who desire the prayers of God's people, that their sins may be forgiven and that they may receive power from on high, to rise to their feet. You may have made a profession of religion for many years, but your profession is of no avail unless in your daily life you live out the principles of truth. If there are those here who have made no profession, but who wish to be set free from habits that have enslaved them, I wish to say to them that they have the privilege of asking the prayers of God's people. Will you rise to your feet, and thus testify that you want to be made complete in Christ? (Nearly all of the congregation arose.)",
