Tell them to go to the Master again and again. Had the common people of the Jewish nation been allowed to receive his message, his precious lessons of instruction, had they known he was the Prince of life, they would not have rejected Jesus, the light of the world, their King and their Redeemer. But the priests and rulers led them astray. Let those whom God has imbued with reason search the Scriptures for themselves, obtaining an experience and knowledge for themselves. Let them search with humble and subdued hearts, seeking earnestly for the precious ore. There is altogether too much at stake for men to accept the opinions of their fellow-men, failing to make diligent search for themselves, as did the noble Bereans.",
