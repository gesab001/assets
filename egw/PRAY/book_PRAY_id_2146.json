    "word": "Chap. 10 - E. G. White Report on Response to the Ottawa Sermon\n\nREPORT OF CAMP MEETING AT OTTAWA, KANSAS, PRINTED IN THE REVIEW AND HERALD, JULY 23, 1889, AND IN SELECTED MESSAGES, BOOK ONE, PP. 355-358. \n\n\n     At the Kansas meeting my prayer to God was that the power of the enemy might be broken and that the people who had been in darkness might open their hearts and minds to the message that God should send them, that they might see the truth, new to many minds, as old truth in new framework. The understanding of the people of God has been blinded, for Satan has misrepresented the character of God. Our good and gracious Lord has been presented before the people clothed in the attributes of Satan, and men and women who have been seeking for truth have so long regarded God in a false light that it is difficult to dispel the cloud that obscures His glory from their view. Many have been living in an atmosphere of doubt, and it seems almost impossible for them to lay hold on the hope set before them in the gospel of Christ. . . .",
