It seemed to be my duty to attend the ministerial institute, and to speak to the brethren assembled there. Then I am under the necessity of keeping four workers busy on different kinds of books. This with my much letter writing seems to keep me employed from three o'clock A.M. till seven o'clock P.M. I deeply sympathize with you, my brother, in your perplexities and trials. As to praying for the sick, it is too important a matter to be handled carelessly. I believe we should take everything to the Lord, and make known to God all our weaknesses, and specify all our perplexities. When in sorrow, when uncertain as to what course to pursue, two or three who are accustomed to pray should unite together in asking the Lord to let His light shine upon them, and to impart His special grace; and He will respect their petitions, He will answer their prayers. If we are under infirmities of body it is certainly consistent to trust in the Lord, making supplications to our God in our own case, and if we feel inclined to ask others in whom we have confidence, to unite with us in prayer to Jesus who is the mighty Healer, help will surely come if we ask in faith. I think we are altogether too faithless, too cold and lukewarm.",
