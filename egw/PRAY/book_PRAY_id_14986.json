    "word": "Last Sabbath, I spoke in forenoon upon Christ's riding into Jerusalem. It made a solemn impression upon the full house. In the afternoon I spoke about one hour and I said just as straight things as God ever gave me to speak, then called them forward. The front seats back to the post were all occupied. Then the side seats, many of them, were filled. A number of backsliders came forward, some making a start for the first time. Leon Smith came forward, Robert Sawyer and many youth. We then prayed and then those who came forward bore their testimony. Robert Sawyer has started again to try, not, he says, in his own strength, but in the strength of Jesus, to be a Christian. This meeting made a very decided impression. \n                                                                           591",
