    "word": "I warn our people to seek the Lord in earnest, humble prayer, that Satan may not triumph in this evil design. Let all who desire to honor God refuse to accept presentations that are so evidently opposed to the ways of the Lord. By such methods as Brother Harris has presented, the truth we hold so sacred is misrepresented before the world. It is as if they say, Believers could not find a \"Thus saith the Lord\" that would satisfactorily explain their duty, and they are compelled to accept the chance methods adopted in gambling to direct their course of action.",
