    "word": "This, in short, is the way I have prayed for the sick. But I have thought that I might quench the faith of others in their intense earnestness, and for some years I have felt that it was not my duty to engage with others in praying for the sick. This was the way I prayed for Henry N. White. But after I have earnestly prayed for the sick, what then? Do I cease to do all I possibly can for their recovery? No. I work all the more earnestly, with much prayer, that the Lord may bless the means which His own hand has provided, entreating that He may give a sanctified wisdom to cooperate with God in the recovery of the sick.",
