    "word": "When the Church is Awakened \n     When the church is awakened, decided changes will be made. Men and women will be converted, and so filled will they be by the Spirit of God that they will pass from country to country, from city to city, proclaiming the message of truth. With hearts filled with earnest love for souls, they will open their Bibles and present the Word, \"It is written.\" Wherever \n                                                                           46\nthey go a people will be raised up to stand in the day of the Lord. The simplicity of these humble workers will be their strength; for angels of God work with those who are humble and obedient. Learned, eloquent men will not see the results from their work that are seen by these humble, zealous, praying men.--Manuscript 2, 1900",
