    "word": "(Convis, Mich.) Sabbath, April 9, 1859. Rose early and rode about twelve miles to Convis to meet with the saints there. The ride was refreshing. . . . A little company of Sabbathkeepers were collected in a large schoolhouse. . . . Meeting held until about two o'clock. . . . After the meeting closed, a woman came to meeting. Thought it was to be in the afternoon. She had walked a mile. She read the notice in the paper but did not read carefully enough to find out the time of meeting; therefore lost it all. After supper as the hours of holy time were closing, we had a refreshing season of prayer. James talked with the children before bowing to pray.",
