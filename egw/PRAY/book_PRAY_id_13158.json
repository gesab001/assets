    "word": "Christians to Pray With a View to the Second Advent--Let us pray as did Jacob. Let us pray in every difficulty; pray that the wondrous message of the love of Christ may reach precious souls, that they too may pray, and be refreshed with heavenly grace. Watch for the Lord more earnestly than they that watch for the morning. Hope in the Lord. Walk in His way. Declare His truth. He is well pleased when His servants talk faith. He wants His light to shine forth in the South. He is working for you and with you.-- Letter 66, 1901, p. 6. (To R. M. Kilgore, June 26, 1901.)",
