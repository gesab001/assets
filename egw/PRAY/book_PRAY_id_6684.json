    "word": "The angels desire that we shall learn that the Son of man came \"to save that which was lost.\" Christ came not to save that which is good and righteous, but \"that which was lost.\" Brethren and sisters, when you see a soul slipping away from the truth, and endangering his hope of eternal salvation, press close to his side, and seek to help him in every way you can. Inquire into his needs; pray with him; labor kindly, patiently, with him; never despair of helping him.",
