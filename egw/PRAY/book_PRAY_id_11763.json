    "word": "Our churches in the South are to have a spiritual resurrection, and the Lord, through His Holy Spirit, will graciously bless the means employed by His servants to bring this about, if the brethren will not hinder the work as they have done in the past. The psalmist prayed, \"That Thy way may be known upon the earth, Thy saving health among all nations.\" Psalms 67:2. Let this prayer be ours. Let us pray that the healing influence of divine revelation, as a heavenly current of vital air, may come upon God's people, imparting physical and spiritual health and vigor. Let us pray that the leaven of His grace shall work in church after church, till God's name is a praise among them, because of His wonderful works. We shall extend His kingdom by doing the work close by us that is waiting to be done.",
