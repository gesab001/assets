    "word": "The Lord set you to do a special work in Battle Creek, and placed before you your dangers in connecting with such men as Frank Belden and J. H. Kellogg. The particulars in these two cases were opened to you as I gave you writings to read to them, and requested you to pray with them. But those men converted you, and you lost your opportunity of converting them, for you took yourself in charge and left the Lord Jesus out of the arrangement. Therefore all the warnings given to save you were disregarded. That showed the manner of spirit you were of. These men converted you to do the very work they were doing and to voice their sentiments.",
