    "word": "FERVENT PRAYER ASCENDS AS A FRAGRANT INFLUENCE.\u2014They have willingly endured hardship and privation, and have watched and prayed for the success of the cause. Their gifts and sacrifices express the fervent gratitude and praise of their hearts to Him who has called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. No more fragrant influence can ascend to heaven. Their prayers and their alms come up as a memorial before God.\u2014(Selected Messages, bk. 2, 212.)",
