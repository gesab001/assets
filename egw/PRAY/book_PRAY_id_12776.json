    "word": "The Lord desires to make every physician and every nurse a minister of healing. Seek to give to the sick the highest kind of knowledge by bringing to their understanding the lessons of the word of truth. Pray with them and for them. Thus while you bring them back to life and help by ministering to their physical needs, you may win them to Christ to be partakers of the life that is eternal.--Ms 57, 1912, p. 1.
