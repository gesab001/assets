    "word": "GOD HEARS AND ANSWERS PRAYER.\u2014God hears prayer. Christ has said, \u201cIf ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it.\u201d Again He says, \u201cIf any man serve Me, him will My Father honor.\u201d John 14:14; 12:26. If we live according to His word, every precious promise He has given will be fulfilled to us. We are undeserving of His mercy, but as we give ourselves to Him, He receives us. He will work for and through those who follow Him.\u2014(Ministry of Healing, 226, 227.)",
