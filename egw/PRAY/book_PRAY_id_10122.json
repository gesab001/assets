    "word": "Yesterday, Brother [Charles] Chittendon took out a number of us on the water in his boat. . . . We remained on the water and beach all day. Sailed out of the Golden Gate upon the ocean. . . . The waves ran high and we were tossed up and down so very grandly. . . . The spray dashing over us. The watchful captain giving his orders, the hands ready to obey. The wind was blowing strong and I never enjoyed anything as much in my life.",
