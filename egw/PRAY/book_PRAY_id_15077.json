    "word": "How can I present before you these facts that are eternal truths? Here you can say, \"In my hands no price I bring, Simply to Thy cross I cling.\" If your prayers--yes, your prayers, feeble as they may seem--are sincere, if they are mixed with faith, then you may know that Jesus liveth to make intercession for you. The persevering, sincere seeker will surely be the finder, for as soon as you approach the mercy seat in faith, then Christ regards you as His client. He espouses your cause; He makes it His own. He is standing before the Father, your Substitute, your Surety. When you seek the Lord with all your heart, \"In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.\" Isaiah 30:15.",
