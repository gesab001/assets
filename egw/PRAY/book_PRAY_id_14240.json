    "word": "When you are tempted to think or speak unwisely, kneel wherever you are, and pray till you find rest in Jesus. I am sure that He will not leave you or forsake you. You may scorn yourself because of your passionate utterances, but remember that Jesus pities you, and that He will heal you, body and soul, if you will do His bidding. Here is His word to you, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me\" [Isaiah 27:5].",
