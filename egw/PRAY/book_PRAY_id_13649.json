    "word": "In many such cases Miss McEnterfer has been called to relieve suffering. One lad, about ten years old, was running to chase a calf out of the yard, when he was thrown down, his foot slipping into a hole where there was a broken glass bottle. The glass cut a deep gash in his ankle. After ten days Miss McEnterfer was sent for. She did not at first think she could save the foot, but she prayed and worked. The greatest care was required in touching the foot. It was a terrible-looking wound. One, as soon as she looked at it, fainted away. She had come to assist Miss McEnterfer, but could not do anything.",
