    "word": "Sabbath, Sept, 20, 1873. The sun shone out beautifully in the morning, but it soon became cloudy and snowed very fast, covering the ground and lodging upon the trees. It looks like winter. All around us is white. Here \n\n\n                                        -165- \n\nwe are just this side of the range in our tent, while the earth is sheeted with snow. . . . We feel deeply our need of the grace of God. . . . Shall I ever learn to be perfectly patient under minor trials? . . . My earnest prayer to God daily is for divine grace to do His will.",
