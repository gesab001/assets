    "word": "DOES NOT PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION TO GOD.\u2014Prayer is not understood as it should be. Our prayers are not to inform God of something He does not know. The Lord is acquainted with the secrets of every soul. Our prayers need not be long and loud. God reads the hidden thoughts. We may pray in secret, and He who sees in secret will hear, and will reward us openly.\u2014(Messages to Young People, 247.)",
