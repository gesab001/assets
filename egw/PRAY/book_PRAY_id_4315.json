    "word": "If the rush of work is allowed to drive us from our purpose of seeking the Lord daily, we shall make the greatest mistakes; we shall incur losses, for the Lord is not with us. We have closed the door so that He cannot find access to our souls. But if we pray, even when our hands are employed, the Saviour's ear is open to hear our petitions. . . . God takes care of you in the place where it is your duty to be. But be sure, as often as possible, to go where prayer is wont to be made.--C.H. 422-424.",
