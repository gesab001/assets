    "word": "Adams Center, New York, Sunday, October 12, 1890 \n\n     I enjoyed a precious night's rest. Arose quarter past four and after seeking the Lord in prayer for His grace and His blessing, I commenced writing. I feel grateful to the Lord that I endured the taxation of yesterday much better than I expected. I do ask the Lord for strength and grace, and praise His holy name that I do receive decidedly, according to the promise given, the very things I most need.--Ms 41, 1890, p. 11 (Diary 16, p. 176).",
