    "word": "Christ loves us with a love that no language can express, no balances measure. His love is beyond comparison. He desires us to love perishing human beings as He has loved us. He wants us to be missionaries for Him. We are to do all in our power to relieve suffering and misery. If we can do no more than speak a word of cheer, let us do that. Christ will cooperate with us. He says, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.... If ye love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever.\"",
