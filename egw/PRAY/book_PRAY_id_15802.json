    "word": "Never let your tongue and voice be employed in discovering and dilating upon the defects of your brethren; for the record of heaven identifies Christ's interests with those he has purchased with his own blood. \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,\" he says \"ye have done it unto me.\" We are to learn to be loyal to one another, to be true as steel in the defence of our brethren. Look to your own defects. You had better discover one of your own faults than ten of your brother's. Remember that Christ has prayed for these, his brethren, that they all might be one as he is one with the father. Seek to the uttermost of your capabilities to be in harmony with your brethren to the extent of Christ's measurement, as he is one with the Father. Then your evil thinking and evil speaking will cease. You will not become bitter and hard against them because they do not make enough of your merits and show special partiality to you. Those who are missionaries for the Master will have the spirit of truth and righteousness.",
