    "word": "God Requires All the Heart \n\n     The religion of the Bible must be practiced, for the world is watching you and criticizing your actions. The office at Oakland needs weeding out. Either those who have long been there and who have not realized the sacredness of the work, should be converted, or they should be discharged. It is the duty of everyone in the office who professes to be a Christian to give unmistakable evidence to those who come to the office that he is a Christian in deed and in truth, and that he is working out the principles of the Bible in all his work. All lightness, all jesting and trifling is to be regarded as unchristian. Let everyone see that you are governed by divine rule, that you are courteous and kind. If you keep the fear of the Lord ever before your eyes, He will work with your efforts, and crown you with success. Satan is continually at work that he may fill the mind with his suggestions, and cause you to follow his counsel. He advises you not to be overscrupulous in regard to honor and integrity, to look out sharply for your own interests, and demand the highest wages for your services. To some degree this is what has brought embarrassment upon the office. When the work is more attentively done, when there is a spirit of consecration, the Lord will hear your \n                                                                           67\nprayers, and will work in your behalf. But there is much unfaithfulness, and you need to call a halt, and begin the work of reformation in earnest. Those who are half-hearted and worldly, who are given to gossiping over the imperfections of others, while giving no attention to their own defects of character, should separate from the office, for they will demoralize others by their mischievous tongues.",
