    "word": "That faith which works by love and purifies the soul is to be revealed among God's people. The Lord has no commendation for those who were lording it over God's heritage.

Religion, what is it unless the experimental elements of piety are revealed in deep heart service because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. \"Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: that ye visit the fatherless and the widow in their affliction, and keep yourselves unspotted from the world.\"",
