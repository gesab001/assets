    "word": "I shall never be satisfied until just such an experience comes into the church here in Oakland and in San Francisco. We want to see the salvation of our God. We want the truth to go forth with mighty power; and why, oh why, do we continue to stand in the way? Why do we grieve the Holy Spirit of God? Why do we put Him to open shame by carrying with us our selfish, unconverted dispositions, and yet all the while claiming to be Christians? God grant that every one of us may have clear eyesight to discern what we can do by looking unto Jesus and by realizing how our course must appear in His sight and how He must regard envy and strife. God help us to put away our individual defects of character. We want to see the power of God revealed in this community. If it were not for this, I should not leave my home and come down here to speak to you so often. But night after night I cannot sleep more than a few hours; and often, in the hours of the night, I find myself sitting up in bed, praying to God in behalf of those who do not realize their spiritual condition; and then I arise and walk the room, and say, O Lord, set Thy people in order, before it shall be everlastingly too late.",
