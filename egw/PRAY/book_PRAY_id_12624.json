    "word": "\"Without me ye can do nothing.\" Keep this before every congregation, that it is entireness, wholeness of purpose that God will accept: but what is the matter that the church elders and officers do not arouse and seek with earnest prayer and determined effort to set the people in the church to work. Are elders in these churches carrying any burden? Do they feel any care for the souls of the sheep of God's pasture? Do they humble their heart before God and by faith lay hold on the grace of Christ and put away their sins and believe their repentance is accepted before God? Have they piety? Have they devotion to God? Will the elders of the church, the officers of the church, draw nigh to God, will they now in probationary time learn the lessons of Jesus Christ and practice them until they shall ascend the high places of faith and command a clearer, more spiritual view of the situation?--Manuscript 20, 1893.
