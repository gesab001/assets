    "word": "We know that the Lord Jesus was tempted in all points like as we are, and He knows how to succor all who shall be tempted. In His humanity, He suffered physical weariness and weakness, hunger, thirst, and sadness. As He saw how obdurate were the hearts of men, He was filled with sorrow. He remained whole nights in prayer for those who would not pray for themselves, and who would not come unto Him that they might have life. Shall we, for whom He suffered so much, choose our own way and will and selfish gratification? Jesus speaks to us, \"Learn of Me\"; \"Be like Me.\" He was human, as you are.",
