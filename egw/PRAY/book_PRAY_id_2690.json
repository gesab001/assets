    "word": "Jesus invites, \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d [Matthew 11:28, 29.] Have you found this rest? If not, there is something for you to do. Do not rely on an experience that you had years in the past, it is your privilege to have a living connection with Christ now. Come to him with brokenness of heart and contrition \n433\nof spirit, praying for his grace. The melting power of God can do wonders in subduing the heart, and making it tender and impressible. You may come with full assurance of faith, and he will fill your heart with rest, and peace, and love.",
