White, February 6, 1890 \n\n\n     Jesus has some very precious words I want to read to you: \"Neither pray I for these alone (that is, the disciples immediately around him), but for them also which shall believe on me through their word\" [John 17:20]. That is us. That means us brethren. \"That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me\" [verse 21]. The unity and the harmony.",
