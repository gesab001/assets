    "word": "Dinner at Stipp's, then Missionary Visits \n     [San Francisco] Saturday, January 11, 1873. I was urged at the close of the meeting to go to different places to dinner, but my husband was at Brother Stipp's and I felt it duty to go there. Sister Ball went with us. In the afternoon we called upon Sister Jones. Found Sister Billet there. We conversed and prayed with these sisters. We had a very precious season. We then visited Sister Hall who was sick at Brother St. John's. We had a precious season of prayer with our sister. In the evening had conference meeting, then my husband spoke upon the coming of the Lord. The house was well filled and the subject was deeply interesting.--Ms 3, 1873, pp. 2, 6.
