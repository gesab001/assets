    "word": "Ellen White's Faithfulness in Writing the Beldens--In every mail that goes to Australia, I send a letter to Stephen Belden, with copies of letters that I have written to others. If I happen to miss a mail, he feels this deeply. Just now I am sending him all that I can; for I fear that each mail that goes will be the last in which I can send him anything. Poor man, he is dying of cancer, and I am so far away that I cannot be near to help him. But I can write to him, and I can pray for him.--Letter 348, 1906, p. 2. (To G. I. Butler, Oct. 30, 1906.)",
