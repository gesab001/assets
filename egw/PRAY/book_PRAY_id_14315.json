    "word": "My dear brethren, I write you these words as I was speaking them to you last night in my dreams. I am praying for the success of your effort in Marlborough. May the Lord give you an earnest spirit of prayer. I have feared that you would fail to come close enough to God to enable Him to do the work He is ready to do for you and through you. He cannot do this work unless you are hid with Christ in God, because self is prepared to take the glory God should have.",
