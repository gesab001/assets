    "word": "Ministers too often stand before the people and deliver lengthy discourses, which in order to do good, need to be divided into three parts. The minds of the people are wearied by such discourses, and the truth loses its effect upon them. Keep humble. In your ministry plead for the presence of the Holy Spirit; for nothing can be done without its aid. Never forget that you are a steward of the grace of God and a servant of the church for Christ's sake. Mingle no selfishness with your work; pray that self may be covered with the garment of Christ's righteousness. \n\n\n                                    -195-",
