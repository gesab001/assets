    "word": "Missionary nurses who care for the sick and relieve the distress of the poor will find many opportunities to pray with them, to read to them from God\u2019s Word, and to speak of the Savior. They can pray with and for the helpless ones who have not strength of will to control the appetites that passion has degraded. They can bring a ray of hope into the lives of the defeated and disheartened. Their unselfish love, manifested in acts of disinterested kindness, will make it easier for these suffering ones to believe in the love of Christ.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, pp. 143-145.",
