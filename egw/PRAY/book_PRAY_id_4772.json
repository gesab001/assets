    "word": "Through Jesus the fallen sons of Adam become \"sons of God.\" \"Both He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.\" The Christian's life should be one of faith, of victory, and joy in God. \"Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\" Truly spake God's servant Nehemiah, \"The joy of the Lord is your strength.\" And Paul says: \"Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.\" \"Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.\"",
