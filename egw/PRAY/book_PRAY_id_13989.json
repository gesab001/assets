    "word": "Brother and Sister Lacey have a large family, and they greatly desired that May should be married at home, and, of course, this is as it should be. At the request of the family, I offered prayer after the marriage ceremony was over. Brother and Sister Lacey invited eight persons besides the family to celebrate the occasion. We took the cars as I have stated, about nine o'clock that night, and in the morning arrived at Launceston, where Brethren Baker and Teasdale were waiting for us at the station. They had secured a room nearby for Mr. and Mrs. W. C. White. Brother and Sister Baker secured lodgings \n\n\n                                   -268- \n\nat a neighbor's, in order that I might have accommodation at the house of Sister Rogers. Willie said that for the first time in his life he would be pleased if he could have a vacation of two weeks; but he did not even have one evening to enjoy the company of his companion.",
