    "word": "I wish to bring before you this morning some things that have been presented to me, showing wherein some of us are making serious mistakes. The minds of many are occupied with the consideration of worldly matters, often to the exclusion of the religion of God's word. The thoughts are more often upon the matter of eating and drinking and dressing than upon the great and important duty of serving God with humility and prayer. The Lord has shown me that in many families decided changes must be brought about; they need to know what they must do to be saved. If they will inquire diligently the way of life, God will impart to them an understanding of His word, and teach them to value at their true worth the things of eternity. Then the heart will no longer reach out covetously for worldly benefits and the pleasures of this life.",
