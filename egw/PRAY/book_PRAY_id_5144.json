    "word": "It takes moral courage for a minister to step out for the Sabbath.--It requires moral courage to take a position to keep the commandments of the Lord. An opposer of the truth once said that it was only weak-minded people, foolish, ignorant persons, who would turn away from the churches to keep the seventh day as the Sabbath. But a minister who embraced the truth replied, \"If you think it takes weak-minded persons, just try it.\" It takes moral courage, firmness, decision, perseverance, and very much prayer to step out on the unpopular side.--Ev 240.",
