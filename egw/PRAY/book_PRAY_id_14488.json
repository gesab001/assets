    "word": "Christ offers a prayer to the Father, and He uses these words in this prayer, \"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth\" (John 17:17). I have sent them into the world as thou hast sent Me into the world, even so have I sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. (See John 17:17-19.) Mark these words, \"I sanctify Myself.\" Thus He observes a life of perfect obedience, for He is the perfect pattern. Then He goes on and says, \"That they may be sanctified\"--by what? Through emotion? through feeling? No. Through the truth. We cannot trust to feeling; we must know the truth.",
