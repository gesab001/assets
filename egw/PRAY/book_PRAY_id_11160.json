Before this blessing came, I felt that my strength was leaving me. I had great suffering through my whole body. It seemed as if the entire system were being crushed. Every nerve and sinew was in pain. I thought of calling up the family, and then I said aloud, \"They can not give me relief.\" I prayed to the Great Physician to change the condition of things, to let me feel His healing power. And relief came.",
