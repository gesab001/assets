    "word": "When we read the letter from Brother Chapman, we praised the Lord. We felt somewhat as we supposed Paul felt when he wrote, \"But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, greatly desiring to see us, as we also to see you, therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our afflictions and distress by your faith: for now we live, if we stand fast in the Lord. For what thanks we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith...And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men, even as we do toward you: to the end that He may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.\" (1 Thessalonians 3:6-10, 12-13)",
