    "word": "I hope the managers of the Battle Creek school and Sanitarium will consider this matter prayerfully, intelligently, and without partiality. Instead of over-educating a few, enlarge the sphere of your charities. Resolve that the means which you mean to use in educating workers for the cause shall not be expended simply upon one, enabling him to get more than he really needs, while others are left without anything at all. Give students a start, but do not feel that it is your duty to carry them year after year. It is their duty to get out into the field to work, and it is your place to extend your charities to others who are in need of assistance.",
