    "word": "I am thankful when I think of the advantages enjoyed by the schools that are established near our sanitariums, so that the work of the two educational institutions can blend. The students in these schools, while gaining an education in the knowledge of present truth, can also learn how to be ministers of healing to those whom they go forth to serve. The prayer of Christ includes such work as this: \"Neither pray I for these alone,\" He said, \"but for them also that shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee; that they also be one in us; that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which Thou gavest Me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as We are One; I in them; and Thou in Me; that they may be made perfect in one: that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me; and hast loved them as Thou hast loved Me.\"",
