    "word": "This name is hallowed by the angels of heaven, by the inhabitants of unfallen worlds. When you pray, \u201cHallowed be thy name,\u201d you ask that it may be hallowed in this world, hallowed in you. God has acknowledged you before men and angels as His child; pray that you may do no dishonor to the \u201cworthy name by the which ye are called\u201d (James 2:7). God sends you into the world as His representative. In every act of life you are to make manifest the name of God. This petition calls upon you to possess His character. You cannot hallow His name, you cannot represent Him to the world, unless in life and character you represent the very life and character of God. This you can do only through the acceptance of the grace and righteousness of Christ.\u2014Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 106, 107.",
