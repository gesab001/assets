    "word": "There is a special work committed to the managers of the Sanitarium. The physicians have a serious responsibility resting upon them, and should have connected with them men of experience, men of prayer who are faithful to the trust which is given them, whatever that trust may be. They are to be subject to one another. All things that are questioned they are to take to the Lord \n                                                                           73\nin prayer. They are to treat with deference and respect those whom God shall appoint to unite with them in their work, just as they would like to be treated. Let superintendent, physician, manager, and matron be up and doing their appointed work; for soon their opportunities will be past, and the recompense will follow. Letter 136, 1900, pp. 3, 11, 12. (To Brethren Sharp, Caro, and Kellogg, October 29, 1900.)",
