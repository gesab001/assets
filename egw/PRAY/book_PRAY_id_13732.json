    "word": "God has given us men who are fitted to act as managers who have had experience in this line and who are men of prayer, men who study the Word and who will, when given a chance, do the work that God has appointed them. Those \n\n\n                                 -89- \n\nwho are appointed to act as managers in our institutions must be men who will consult their brethren. The very evidence given that one man or two men feel that all the responsibility devolves on them is the sure sign they are not qualified for the work and cannot discern how much is pending. They must be men who will watch unto prayer. God will use men who walk humbly before Him, who keep His fear before them, and who tremble at His word. But self-confidence, if encouraged, will lead to disastrous results.",
