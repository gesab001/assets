    "word": "They must be content to come up gradually, and prove their ability by showing that they sense the responsibilities laid upon them in lesser matters. Physicians who have been able to obtain a diploma from a medical school, feel too much on an equal with Dr. Kellogg; when, from the light the Lord has given me, they have but just begun their education. There are but few who carry the load that Dr. Kellogg has carried,--not one who has from the very commencement borne the heavy burden of care that he has borne. They do not love the taxing, burden-bearing part. They will deal with the sick, but never lift the load. They take everything very easy. The sick may approach the last crisis, that would wring the heart of the Doctor with intense pain because a life is going out and he can devise no means of saving that life, and  another physician connected with him will not sense the danger, and devote time to sharp thought and severe mental labor. He works as a machine. He is as calm as a summer's evening, when he should be pressed as a cart beneath sheaves. He takes it all as a matter of course, a thing that must be; when had he more of the intensity of feeling possessed by Dr. Kellogg, he would not throw off the burden for an instant, but by sharp thinking, by earnest prayer, would devise ways and means yet untried, and would perhaps be able to save not only the life, but, through Christ, the soul of the patient. \n\n\n                         -13-",
