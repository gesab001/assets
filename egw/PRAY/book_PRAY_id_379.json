    "word": "Enoch walked with God three hundred years previous to his translation to heaven, and the state of the world was not then more favorable for the perfection of Christian character than it is today. And how did Enoch walk with God? He educated his mind and heart to ever feel that he was in the presence of God, and when in perplexity his prayers would ascend to God to keep him. He refused to take any course that would offend his God. He kept the Lord continually before him. He would pray, \u201cTeach me Thy way, that I may not err. What is Thy pleasure concerning me? What shall I do to honor Thee, my God?\u201d. . .",
