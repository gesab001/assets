    "word": "Every ship sailing the sea of life needs to have the Divine Pilot on board; but when storms arise, when tempests threaten, many persons push their Pilot overboard, and commit their bark into the hand of finite man, or try to steer it themselves. Then disaster and wreckage generally follow, and the Pilot is blamed for running them into such dangerous waters. Do not commit yourselves into the keeping of men, but say, \"The Lord is my helper;\" I will seek his counsel, I will be a doer of his will. All the advantages you may have cannot be a blessing to you, neither can the highest-class education qualify you to become a channel of light, unless you have the co-operation of the Divine Spirit. It is as impossible for us to receive qualification from man, without the divine enlightenment, as it was for the gods of Egypt to deliver those who trusted in them. Students must not suppose that every suggestion for them to prolong their studies is in harmony with God's plan. Let every such suggestion be taken to the Lord in prayer, and seek earnestly for his guidance,--not only once, but again and again. Plead with him, until you are convinced whether the counsel is of God or man. Do not trust yourself to men. Act under the Divine Guide.",
