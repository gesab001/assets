    "word": "How pleased we should be to see your pleasant face and to hear your voice and to see the children, Henry and Herbert and Grace. Dear children, you must try to help your mother all you possibly can; for your father is not at home to encourage her and to help to bear the burdens. I pray for you \n\n\n                                          -53- \n\nall, and love you all. I pray that the Lord Jesus will make you kind and patient and gentle and obedient. Your father would be pleased to be with you. He would greatly enjoy the society of your mother and of his children. But there are many things that must be done at this time which your father can do. Just as soon as we have done what must be done, we shall return to our home in St. Helena.",
