    "word": "I have written largely in regard to Christians who believe the truth placing their cases in courts of law to obtain redress. In doing this, they are biting and devouring one another in every sense of the word \"to consume one another.\" They cast aside the inspired counsel of God and in the face of the message He gives they do the very thing He has told them not to do. Such \n\n\n                                     -415- \n\nmen may as well stop praying to God, for He will not hear their prayers. They insult Jehovah, and He will leave them to become the subjects of Satan until they shall see their folly and seek the Lord by confession of their sins. . . .",
