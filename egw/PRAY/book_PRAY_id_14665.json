    "word": "God is not with those who criticize and find fault, and I wish all to know it. If those who had criticized had gone to the Southern field and had talked with Edson as brother should with brother, counseling and praying with him, how much better it would have been. But instead of doing this, they stood off and fired shots at his work, making things out to be as bad as possible. Why did they not go over the field for themselves, so that they could make a true report? They had opportunity to do this, but instead they took the reports which had been brought by someone else. We read in the Psalms that the one who will stand in the courts of the Lord is the man who takes not up a reproach against his neighbor.",
