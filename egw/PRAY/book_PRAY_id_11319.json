    "word": "Growth in grace does not come without much earnest prayer, without the humbling of self at every step. Jesus said: \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\" \n                                                                           19\n\"Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat; because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\"",
