    "word": "Washington, D.C., Monday, December 22, 1890 \n\n     This day was devoted in the early morning, at half past four o'clock, to prayer for the Lord to bless me and give me physical strength and mental clearness, and clear spiritual discernment. I believe the promise, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, ye shall find; knock, \n                                                                           769\nand it shall be opened unto you.\" I shall take the Lord Jesus at His word.",
