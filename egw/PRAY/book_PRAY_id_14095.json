    "word": "Walling's Mills, Wednesday, September 10, 1873. We have been praying \n\n                                     -207- \n\nearnestly to know our duty in regard to leaving our present location and temporary home for California. We have prayed earnestly for light but got none. We feel rather unsettled. We desire to know our duty and we feel willing to do whatever it may be. We went to Central. Called to see Mr. Parker. We found him no better. He was very glad to see us. My husband promised to come in Friday and give him fomentations. We purchased several things at Central in the line of dry goods. Brother Glover and Willie spent the day hunting, but found nothing. Mr. Walling came at midnight. We talked with him in regard to Central Park. Mrs. Laskey, her two children, and Mrs. Toll took dinner with Sister Hall in our absence.",
