    "word": "PRAYERS FOR OUR FAMILY ARE BEST PRAYED AT HOME.\u2014We should not come to the house of God to pray for our families unless deep feeling shall lead us while the Spirit of God is convicting them. Generally, the proper place to pray for our families is at the family altar. When the subjects of our prayers are at a distance, the closet is the proper place to plead with God for them. When in the house of God, we should pray for a present blessing and should expect God to hear and answer our prayers. Such meetings will be lively and interesting.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, 145, 146.)",
