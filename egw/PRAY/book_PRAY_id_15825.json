    "word": "It is the privilege of each student here to know that the Most High has a care for you. He will watch over you for good, and not for evil. If you follow on to know the Lord, you will know His going forth is prepared as the morning. You will increase continually in light and knowledge. I want to see the goodness and mercy of God revealed in this place. We will pray for you; we will do all we can to help you; we will send you publications that you can read and study. I want to meet you each in the kingdom of God. Let us fight the battles of the Lord manfully and righteously, that we may see in the city of God the faces we look upon here today. Let us educate and train the younger members of the Lord\u2019s family. They are to stand firmly with God\u2019s people.",
