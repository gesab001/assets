    "word": "I was told by my guide that there had been a witness to the Christless talk, the rabble talk which evidenced the spirit that prompted the words. When they entered their rooms evil angels came with them, because they closed the door to the Spirit of Christ and would not listen to His voice. There was not a humbling of the soul before God. The voice of prayer was seldom heard, but criticism and exaggerated statements and suppositions and conjectures and envy and jealousy and evil surmising and false accusing were current. Had their eyes been opened they would have seen that which would have alarmed them, the exulting of evil angels. And they would have seen also a Watcher who had heard every word and registered these words in the books of heaven.",
