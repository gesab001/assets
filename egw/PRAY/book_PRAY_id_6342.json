    "word": "To us, as to Peter, the word is spoken, \u201cSatan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.\u201d Luke 22:31, 32. Thank God, we are not left alone. He who \u201cso loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, \n302\nbut have everlasting life\u201d (John 3:16), will not desert us in the battle with the adversary of God and man. \u201cBehold,\u201d He says, \u201cI give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.\u201d Luke 10:19.",
