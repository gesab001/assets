    "word": "In their lonely retreats they often met their Redeemer and conversed with him, as did the two disciples on the way to Emmaus. He would there open to them the sublime truths of his word, and strengthen them in their determination not to put confidence in false guides, but to obey and worship Him only who made and governs the world, \u201cHe sees and knows everything,\u201d they continually repeated to themselves. \u201cHe will hear our prayers, and attend unto our wants. He who feedeth the ravens will not leave us to perish.\u201d Thus their words of faith cheered themselves and others, and their trials and perplexities only drove them nearer to God and increased their faith.",
