    "word": "God commended Solomon's prayer. And He will today hear and commend the prayers of those who in faith and humility cry to Him for aid. He will certainly answer the fervent prayer for a preparation for service. In answer He will say, Here I am. What wilt thou that I shall do for thee? . . . He who led Solomon's mind as he made this prayer will today teach His servants how to pray for what they need.",
