    "word": "We are commanded to love one another as Christ has loved us. He has manifested His love by laying down His life to redeem us. The beloved disciple says that we should be willing to lay down our lives for the brethren. For \"every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him\" (verse 1). If we love Christ, we shall love those who resemble Him in life and character. And not only so, but we shall love those who have \"no hope,\" and are \"without God in the world\" (Ephesians 2:12). It was to save sinners that Christ left His home in heaven and came to earth to suffer and to die. For this He toiled and agonized and prayed, until, heartbroken and deserted by those He came to save, He poured out His life on Calvary.",
