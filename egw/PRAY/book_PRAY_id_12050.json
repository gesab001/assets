    "word": "Bro. Smith seemed shorn of his strength. He was greatly discouraged, and concluded it must be best to separate himself from the work. God, in his great mercy, did not leave them to do this. He impressed my husband's mind forcibly while in prayer, and our hearts were drawn out after Bro. and sister Smith. The invitation of the Spirit of God was to sister Smith to again take hold of his strength, and make peace with him. The Spirit of God rested upon the few bowed in prayer, and our hearts were made to rejoice together in God.",
