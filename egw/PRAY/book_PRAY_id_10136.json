    "word": "We are not to live in this world to please ourselves. We have stern, earnest work to do every day of our lives. We look by faith to the things that are unseen and in so doing we lose sight of the trials and hardships of the way. Heaven is our home. We dare not run any risk of losing the one hope we have cherished so long, of seeing Jesus as He is and of being made like Him. We hope you will guard your steps. Live the life of prayer and faith and win the unfading crown of glory.",
