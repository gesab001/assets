    "word": "You should not place yourself where you will be corrupted by dissolute companionship. As one who loves your soul I beseech you to shun, as far as possible, the company of the profligate, the licentious, and the ungodly. Pray, \"Lead us not into temptation,\" that is, \"Do not, O Lord, suffer us to be overcome when assailed by temptation.\" Watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation. There is a difference between being tempted, and entering into temptation.--Letter 8, 1893. \n                                                                           193",
