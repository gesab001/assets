    "word": "The glory of God is His character. While Moses was in the mount, earnestly interceding with God, he prayed, \"I beseech thee, show me thy glory.\" In answer God declared, \"I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.\" The glory of God--His character--was then revealed: \"The Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty\" (Exodus 33:18, 19; 34:6, 7).",
