    "word": "Men often establish wrong habits that need to be exchanged for right ones. Those who fail to realize their high and holy privilege of conforming to the divine standard, and neglect to remedy these defects of character, are not to be chosen or retained as educators of the youth. The example of every such a one would prove detrimental to the best interests of the school. Such men are often endowed with many excellent qualities, but their usefulness is impaired because of their failure to discern their defects and the danger of unconsciously stamping these defects upon other characters. Sad it is that some men retain these defects throughout the entire period of life. By earnest, prayerful study, by counseling with their brethren and putting forth untiring effort, they may, if they choose, remedy these defects.",
