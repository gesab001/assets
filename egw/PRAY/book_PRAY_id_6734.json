    "word": "But I can say to those to whom God has intrusted goods, who have lands and houses: \"Commence your selling, and giving alms.  Make no delay.  God expects more of you than you have been willing to do.\"  We call upon you who have means, to inquire with earnest prayer:  What is the extent of the divine claim upon me and my property?  There is work to be done now to make ready a people to stand in the day of the Lord.  Means must be invested in the work of saving souls who, in turn, shall bring their offerings to the treasury, and win souls to the Lord.  -- RH Extra, Dec. 11, 1888.",
