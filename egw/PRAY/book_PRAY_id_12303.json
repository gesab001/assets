    "word": "Well could John exclaim, \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not.\" 1 John 3:1. It is an amazing thing that after the great sacrifice had been made, man, in return, should treat the loving Saviour as he did. Our heavenly Father manifested His love in the gift of His Son for the human race, yet they knew Him not. At His baptism, when on the banks of Jordan, He made the greatest prayer that ever fell on mortal ear, the heavens opened and the voice of God spake in thundering tone: \"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" How many there are who read over this statement without being impressed. It does not seem to leave an impression that it concerns them. But it has everything to do with us, for it was the Saviour's arm that grasped the throne of heaven. Sin had divorced this world from the eternal world, and this is what caused the Son of man to give His life for the human race, and connect us again with heaven.",
