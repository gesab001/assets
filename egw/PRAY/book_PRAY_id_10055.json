    "word": "Satan is preparing many and strong temptations with which to assail the people of God. He is represented as walking to and fro like a roaring lion, seeking for some unguarded soul whom he may be successful in deceiving through his subtlety, and may finally destroy. We are not safe without Christ for a single step. But what comfort is treasured for us in the words, \"I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not\"! Satan does not sift chaff; it is the wheat that he desires to have in his hands. Then let us take courage and pray at all times.",
