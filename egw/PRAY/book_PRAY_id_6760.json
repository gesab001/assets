    "word": "But the case of Solomon is before us as a beacon of warning.  When thou, aged pilgrim who hast fought the battles of life, thinkest that thou standest, take heed lest thou fall.  How, in Solomon's case, was weak, vacillating character, naturally bold, firm, and determined, shaken like a reed in the wind under the tempter's power!  How was an old gnarled cedar of Lebanon, a sturdy oak of Bashan, bent before the blast of temptation! What a lesson for all who desire to save their souls to watch unto prayer continually!  What a warning to keep the grace of Christ ever in their heart, to battle with inward corruptions and outward temptations!  -- 2BC 1031,1032.",
