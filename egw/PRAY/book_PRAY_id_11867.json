    "word": "\"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they \n\n\n                        -18- \n\nmay be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.\" Christ brought human nature into a personal relation with his own divinity. Thus he has given a center for the faith of the universe to fasten upon.",
