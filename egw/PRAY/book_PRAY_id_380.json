    "word": "We want to pray with David, \u201cOpen thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.\u201d Many close their eyes lest they shall see the truth. They do not want to see the defects in their life and character, and they are disturbed if you mention anything about God\u2019s law. In this they show that they have a human standard of their own, that their will is not the will of God. We want that you should not be deceived by Satan, the first great adversary of God\u2019s law. We want to bear in mind that God\u2019s law is the only standard by which He will judge us. . . .",
