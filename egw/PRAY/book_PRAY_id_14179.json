    "word": "I am sorry to hear that your wife is no better. Do not allow one word of a sorrowful nature to be spoken in her hearing. Let soft, encouraging, hopeful songs be sung to her. We are praying for Sister Magan--praying that the Lord will raise her up. Do not speak of trials or of anything that would have a depressing influence upon her. Talk of Christ and His power to save.",
