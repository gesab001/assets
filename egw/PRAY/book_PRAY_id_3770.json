    "word": "\u201cOur child was recovering, and Satan was not permitted to afflict him again. We worked early and late, sometimes not allowing ourselves time to sit at the table to eat our meals, but having a piece by our side we would eat and work at the same time. By overtaxing my strength in folding large sheets, I brought on a severe pain in my shoulder which did not leave me for years. We had been anticipating a journey East, and our child was again well enough to travel. We took the packet for Utica. There was on the boat a young woman from Centerport who was busy relating to others some things concerning us. And they would occasionally promenade back and forth the length of the boat to get a view of me. They had been informed that I had visions, and the young lady was heard to say, \u2018They are such a strange people! They can be heard praying at all times in the day, and often in the night. Most of their time is spent in prayer.\u2019 Many curious eyes were turned towards us, to examine us, especially the one who had visions. There was at one time some trouble on the boat. The chamber-maid had been abused by one of the passengers. She went with her complaint to the captain of the boat, and gained many sympathizers. \n277\nWhile she was describing the one who had abused her, many eyes were turned toward me, as the dress described answered very nearly to my dress. It was whispered round, \u2018It is her! It is her! The one that has visions! What a shame!\u2019 And a zealous one spoke up and asked if it was me, pointing towards me. \u2018Oh no, no,\u2019 said she in her Irish tongue, \u2018Surely she is as nice a little woman as there is on the boat.\u2019 I could but notice how gladly they would have had me the guilty one, because I had visions.",
