    "word": "Chapter XXXVII. - The Missionary Nurse.\n\nNeed of Nurses. \n     1060. In almost every church there are young men and women who might receive an education either as physicians or nurses. They will never have a more favorable opportunity than now. I would urge that this subject be considered prayerfully, that special effort be made to select those youth who give promise of usefulness and moral strength. Let these receive an education at our Sanitarium at Battle Creek, to go out as missionaries wherever the Lord may call them to labor.--M. M., V. II, p. 216.",
