    "word": "God's law reads, \"Thou shalt not bear false witness.\" I hope none will go from this meeting repeating the false statements that have been circulated here, or carrying with them the spirit which has been here manifested. It has not been of Christ; it has come from another source. All who have the truth can afford to be fair. See to it, my brethren, that words coming from finite man are not received as the voice of God. We want to be Christians. We should pray and study our Bibles more. Nothing is safe that does not bear the credentials of heaven. Let God be true, and every man a liar. His word is infinite, and every man will find that it is sure and steadfast forever.",
