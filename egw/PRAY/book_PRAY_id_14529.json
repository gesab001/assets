    "word": "I love Him; I love Him for He first loved me. He has broken my heart; He has broken it, and it is not good for anything unless it is broken. Your heart is not good for anything unless it is broken. God help us that we may this very day surrender to God. There is a work to be done here. There is a work to be done in the church--a wonderful work. You are to love as you never have loved before. You are to pray to Him as you never have prayed before. You are to seek Him as you never have sought Him before. Are you going into a monastic cell as Martin Luther did to scourge yourself? The question is asked: \"Shall I give my firstborn . . . for the sin of my soul?\" [see Micah 6:6-8]. Is it burnt offerings and sacrifices that God requires? He says, \"My soul is full of them.\" It is not that. It is a contrite heart; it is that you walk humbly, and deal justly, and show mercy. This is your work.",
