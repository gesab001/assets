    "word": "The privileges, the blessings of the child of God are represented by the apostle in the following language: \"To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.\" When we realize that our hope of glory is Christ, that we are complete in him, we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. The apostle further says, that he ceased not to pray \"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.\"",
