    "word": "\"As Christ was riding into Jerusalem, on the crest of Olivet, He broke forth in uncontrollable grief, exclaiming in broken utterances, as he looked upon Jerusalem, \"If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day,  the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. \" He wept not for himself, but for the despisers of his mercy, long suffering and forbearance. The course taken by the hardhearted and impenitent inhabitants of the doomed city, is similar to the attitude of churches and individuals toward Christ at the present time. They neglect his requirements and despise his forbearance. There is a form of godliness, there is ceremonial worship, there are complimentary prayers; but the real power is wanting. The heart is not softened by grace but is cold and unimpressionable. Many like the Jews are blinded by unbelief, and know not the time of their visitation. So far as the truth is concerned, they have had every advantage; God has been appealing to them for years, in warnings, in reproofs, corrections, and instructions in righteousness but special directions have been given only to be disregarded and placed on a level with common things.\" T. 32, p. 14",
