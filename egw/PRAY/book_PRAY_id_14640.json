    "word": "The lesson was that in the education of young men we should not lead them to think that it is sermonizing that is to do the work. We say it, but let them see the results carried out. After the discourse is through, we should take time to seek God by ourselves. That used to be the way. The ministers would go away and pray together, and they would not let loose until the Spirit of God responded to their prayers. They would come away with their faces fairly lighted up, and when they spoke to the congregation their words meant something. They reached the hearts of the people because the Spirit that gave the blessing to them prepared the hearts to receive the message.",
