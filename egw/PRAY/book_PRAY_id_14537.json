    "word": "Well, then, if you drink, how shall we know that you have been drinking? How will anyone know that you have been drinking? Will you go out and begin to kick and scold your cattle, and beat them, and bruise them? They are God's dumb animals and cannot retaliate. He made them. You must respect your cattle. \n\n\n                                    -199- \n\nWill you rise from prayer and begin to scold and fret at your children, and at the circumstances and things that transpire in your house? Will you do it? Well, what shall we think of you? We will think you are an agent of the devil, that is what; we think the thoughts that such a course of action produces. Whatever your profession, however high it may be, if the truth you profess does not have influence enough on you to change your natural heart, to convert you to be kind and courteous, and to give you a new heart and a new mind, seek the true character now.",
