    "word": "Chapter 23 \u2014Prayer for Forgiveness\n\nTHE PRAYER FOR FORGIVENESS IS ALWAYS ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY.\u2014When we pray for earthly blessings, the answer to our prayer may be delayed, or God may give us something other than we ask, but not so when we ask for deliverance from sin. It is His will to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children, and to enable us to live a holy life. Christ \u201cgave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father.\u201d Galatians 1:4. And \u201cthis is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.\u201d 1 John 5:14, 15. \u201cIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d 1 John 1:9.\u2014(The Desire of Ages, 266.)",
