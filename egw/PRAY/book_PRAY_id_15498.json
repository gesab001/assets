    "word": "(621) \"And Moses said unto the Lord, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people, and thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in My sight. Now therefore, I pray Thee, If I have found grace in They sight, show my now Thy way, that I may know Thee, that I may find grace in Thy sight; and consider that this nation is Thy people. And He said, \"My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. And he said unto Him, If Thy presence go not with me, carry me not up hence. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in Thy sight? Is it not in that Thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and Thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.",
