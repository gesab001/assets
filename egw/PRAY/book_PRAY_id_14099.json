    "word": "In the mountains, Colorado, Wednesday, September 17, 1873. We have another beautiful morning. No rain has yet come to trouble us. We have some wind which draws down the canyon. We have to move our little stove several times in the day as the wind changes from one end of the tent to the other. We had a season of prayer this morning alone by ourselves.",
