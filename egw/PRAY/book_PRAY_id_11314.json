    "word": "The minister of the gospel should be far from cherishing an envious spirit, fearing that another may receive too much credit if he shares his labor with him, in the office or in more general life. Selfishness has so actuated men that the work of God has been hindered, and the message of God has been refused by many. Feelings have been manifested, a spirit cherished, that the Lord condemns, and the evil has not all been seen and confessed, and restitution made. The Spirit and power of God have been shut away from those who have cherished envy. The half work done in the ministry was really worse than if nothing had been done; for such a mould has been given that much time, much hard, earnest labor, will be required in order that the impressions may be changed, and the right kind of education be advanced. The churches have been so trained that they feel no special responsibility to visit, to talk the truth, to pray with and for one another, to visit the sick, to encourage them, to give sympathy and love, and make it manifest that in Christ they are members one of another. All revealings of love-sick sentimentalism prove a snare to souls. Some have stood as it were upon the very brink of the precipice, and one more step in the wrong direction would prove their eternal ruin.",
