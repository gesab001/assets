    "word": "God expects every man to be faithful in his stewardship. Self is not to be glorified. The man who is faithful to his trust will not stop to consider if he is going to be honored by any course of action, but will ask, \"Will God be honored?\" His soul will be filled with a holy desire to see God magnified. When something tries his patience, he will pray, \"My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from Him\" (Psalm 62:5).",
