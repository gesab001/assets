    "word": "The door is open; your desires, your prayers, can reach Christ, and His grace will shine forth to you from that open door which all the confederacy of evil cannot close. Call upon Him in the day of trouble, seek Him in the hour of your need, and He will not fail you nor forsake you. Constantly bear in mind under whose banner you have decided to stand. If you are Christ's soldier, then honor your Captain; take a decided stand against every wrong practice.",
