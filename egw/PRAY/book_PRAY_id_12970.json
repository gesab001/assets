    "word": "These delays are most painful to me. We are losing time that we can ill afford to lose. Whatever the cuts may be, if they are essential to the sale of the book, put them in, and afterwards, if we have a chance to make improvements, we will do so. But we must have the book, so please hasten its completion. May the Lord give you all wisdom and counsel, is my prayer.-- Letter 19, 1898, p. 1. (To C. H. Jones, Manager of the Pacific Press, March 25, 1898.) \n\nReleased November 13, 1978.",
