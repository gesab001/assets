    "word": "Jesus spent the entire night in prayer, and in the morning, while returning again from Bethany, he passed a fig-orchard. He was hungry, \"And seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon; and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever. And his disciples heard it.\"",
