The gospel in the Old and New Testaments is not to be contemplated from a narrow, single aspect, as one or two men, or even many men may view it. How large, how broad, how extensive, is the gospel! I have been writing upon this subject for years, and have much written that I cannot now place in shape to be handled. I have had but a trifle of editing done for one year. I speak the things, and write the things, that burden my soul, whether men will hear, or whether they will forbear. I must work; I must watch; I must pray; I must consider nothing in a narrow, contracted style. The Lord Jesus in his instruction was pleased to fashion character after the divine likeness.",
