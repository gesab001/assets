    "word": "Youth Singing for Higher Classes--Students, go out into the highways and the hedges. Endeavor to reach the higher as well as the lower classes. Enter the homes of the rich and the poor, and as you have opportunity ask, \"Would you be pleased to have us sing? We should be glad to hold a song service with you.\" Then as hearts are softened, the way may open for you to offer a few words of prayer for the blessing of God. Not many will refuse. Such ministry is genuine missionary work. God desires every one of us to be converted, and to learn to engage in missionary effort in earnest. He will bless us in this service for others, and we shall see of His salvation. --RH Aug. 27, 1903.",
