    "word": "Vows to Carry On After Husband's Death \n\n     During this severe attack of sickness [experienced in Oakland, California, in 1888] I had vividly brought to my remembrance the experience I passed through when my husband was dying.

I have not lost the deep views of my work, as I sat by the bed of my husband with his dying hand in mine.  -- Ms 21, 1888.",
