    "word": "You are to consider the words of Christ, \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" Leave Christ out of your service and you cannot distinguish between the common and sacred fire. Oh, such are too crowded with the cares of life to pray. . . . Now what is the use of leaving Jesus out of the question and go on with your bungling work, botched work, and with your affections centered upon the things of this world, and absorbed and controlled by the business part--the temporal things of this life and that which is of no value to us--while that which is of eternal moment to us is put away as a thing to be taken up transiently, when most convenient. If you go to meeting, you cannot keep awake, because you have robbed God of the nerve-brain power in pressure \n\n\n                                 -49- \n\nof worldly cares. . . . You have not been drinking of the life streams which make glad the city of our God. You have not been drinking of the snow of Lebanon, but you have been drinking at the malarious streams in the valley, and what you need is religion. It is what you will have to have or you will never enter the kingdom of God.--Manuscript 35, 1891, pp. 4,5. (\"Work and Baptism of the Holy Spirit Needed,\" September 26, 1891.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. February 15, 1979",
