    "word": "Christ charged those whom He healed to tell the good news in the home circle, but not to the world. He would not convert the world by His miracles. His work was to present the Word, that man might not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. His prayer for them was, \"sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.\" . . .",
