    "word": "When, as you labor for the salvation of souls, sinners are convicted of their sins and you have evidence that Christ has had compassion on them, that new hope is springing up in their hearts, it is not correct to say, \"We prayed for him, and he gave his heart to God and was saved.\" This is misleading. It is their privilege to say, solemnly, seriously, gladly, \"I believe that Jesus Christ has forgiven my sins.\" Encourage every soul to have hope and faith, but never . . . say of any man, \"He is saved.\" . . .",
