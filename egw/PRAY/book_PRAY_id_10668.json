    "word": "Watch and pray, fathers and mothers, lest ye enter into temptation. Give your hearts and minds and souls to God's service. You are not to be severe, but kneel before the Lord with your own hearts softened by the grace of God. Be converted that you may have the earnest of the Holy Spirit. What a comfort to know that the Lord will help you in every emergency, for you are laborers together with God. . . .",
