    "word": "We were glad to receive your letter, but sorry, very sorry, that the rebellious element is still active in the service of the first leader of all rebellions. And he will keep them in his service. I have been carrying heavy burdens of responsibility, one thing following upon the heels of another, until I am very weary. I have frequently been unable to sleep, and am often writing at the hours of twelve p.m. and one a.m., with pen in hand working off the burden that lies heavily upon my soul. But I feel the greatest weight when I think of these men who have had great light and great opportunities and yet have turned from the light to give heed unto fables. My prayer to God has not ceased in their behalf. Yes, I tell it all to the Lord, and I do not cease to beseech the Father in the name of His Son Jesus Christ that He will break the infatuation that is upon these souls, and let them see who is their leader.",
