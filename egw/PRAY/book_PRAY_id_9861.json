    "word": "There is little that any of you can do alone. Two or more are better than one, if there will be that humility that you will esteem each other better than yourselves. If any of you consider your plans and modes of labour perfect, you greatly deceive yourselves. Counsel together with much prayer and humbleness of mind, willing to be entreated and advised. This will bring you where God will be your Counsellor. The work you are engaged in cannot \n10\nbe done except by forces which are the result of well-understood plans. If you undertake the work in a narrow, cheap plan, as they have done in [the British] mission, it will be no more in place in Africa than in any British territory and will not be wisdom in any large city.",
