    "word": "Will not the representatives from the different Conferences make arrangements to have meetings in the various churches in their districts, and see to it that one church shall be a help to another? Some may be called to go twenty, fifty, or one hundred miles from home to attend meeting with those of like precious faith; but they should not count it a sacrifice. If they call upon God to imbue them with the Holy Spirit, to give them words to speak that will be as meat in due season, they will find their own hearts refreshed, and they will be richly repaid. It has often been found that where there was but a limited \n243\nnumber, the most precious and profitable seasons have been enjoyed. In such meetings there had been ample time for conversation on religious topics, time for prayer together, time for rejoicing in the love of God. Every member of the church could learn the needs of his brethren and sisters, and by so doing could pray more intelligently for them. It is impossible to do this so fully at large camp-meetings or other gatherings, but at these smaller meetings we have found our hearts knit together in bonds of love and Christian fellowship.",
