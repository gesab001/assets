    "word": "The human heart longs for sympathy in suffering. This longing Christ felt to the very depths of His being, and He went to the place \n\n\n                   -261- \n\nwhere He had left His disciples. Had He found them praying, He would have been relieved. But they were asleep. They could give Him no comfort. Once more after this He came to them, but again He found them asleep.",
