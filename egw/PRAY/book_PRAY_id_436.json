    "word": "When Christ came into our world as a babe in Bethlehem, the angels sang out, \u201cGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\u201d. . . Satan with all his synagogue\u2014for Satan claims to be religious\u2014determined that Christ should not carry out the counsels of heaven. After Christ was baptized, He bowed on the banks of Jordan, and never before had heaven listened to such a prayer as came from His divine lips. . . . The glory of God, in the form of a dove of burnished gold, rested upon Him, and from the infinite glory was heard these words, \u201cThis is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\u201d The human race is encircled by the human arm of Christ, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite One. The prayer of Christ cleaved right through the darkness and entered where God is. To each of us it means that heaven is open before us. It means that the gates are ajar, that the glory is imparted to the Son of God and all who believe in His name. . . .",
