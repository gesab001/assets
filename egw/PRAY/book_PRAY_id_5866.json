To Isaiah was given the message for Hezekiah: \u201cThus saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.\u201d 2 Kings 19:6, 7.\u2014(Prophets and Kings, 354.)",
