    "word": "I spoke to a full house in the afternoon from John 14. The Lord put His Holy Spirit upon me in large measure. There was a large attendance of unbelievers. \n\n\n                                    -329- \n\nWe hoped when we made the call for all who wished to take their stand for the Lord more fully, that several would have strength to decide, but something held them. The enemy seemed to have power over them and none led out on this occasion. After much labor, and a season of earnest prayer, some responded, and yet we felt that there should have been a more earnest response. We had done our duty. We could do no more. But we were disappointed at the reluctance to move. Many were in the house that we knew were not in a prepared state to work for the Master, either in their own house, or in their neighborhood, or in the church, but it seemed that a spell was upon them.",
