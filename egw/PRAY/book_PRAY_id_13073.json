    "word": "Lucinda Hall Dearer Than Earthly Sisters--We cannot feel at home without you [Lucinda Hall]. You are linked to our souls as part and parcel of us. We have held most earnest seasons of prayer in your behalf and we believe that the Lord has listened to our prayers. I have felt so anxious about you I could not sleep. We love you, and we can appreciate you as no others can but your own people, for we know what you sacrificed--and with what cheerfulness--for the truth's sake. God is acquainted with every sacrifice you have made, and you will certainly be a sharer in the eternal reward given to the true, faithful workers. If we get any reward you will, most surely. My precious Lucinda, you are dearer to me than any earthly sister I have living. May the blessing of God and His peace abide upon you is my most earnest prayer.--Letter 71, 1874, p. 1. (To Lucinda Hall, October 14, 1874.)",
