    "word": "The work of the teachers in our College will be laborious. Among those who attend the school, there \n                                                                           28\nwill be some who are nothing less than Satan's agents. They have no respect for the rules of the school, and they demoralize all who associate with them. After the teachers have done all they can to reform this class; after they have, by personal effort, by entreaties and prayer, endeavored to reach them, and they refuse all the efforts made in their behalf, and continue in their course of sin, then it will be necessary to separate them from the school, that others may not be contaminated by their evil influence.",
