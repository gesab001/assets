    "word": "Never forget that the Saviour's loving presence continually surrounds us, and we are invited to come to Him when we are weary and heavy laden. He says, \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" Seek Him as one who wants you to find Him to the joy of your soul. This will give vitality to your faith and earnestness to your prayers. Never approach your Lord with the impression that He is far from you. He is near thee, even at thy right hand to help thee. Be sure to trust the keeping of your soul to Him. You are His by creation, and you are His by redemption.--Letter 75, 1897, pp. 1, 2. (To Sister Ings, July 3, 1897.)",
