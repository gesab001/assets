    "word": "Brethren, be on guard. Keep burnished for action the weapons of your warfare, which is the Word of God. Pray, believe, and walk humbly with God, and let all your prayers be without ceasing that God shall be glorified. Make a most earnest effort to call to Battle Creek the very best ministerial talent, men of experience in the early days of the message, men who will give the trumpet a certain sound. Hold the fort. Do not let it be taken by those who have placed themselves decidedly in a position of opposition to the truth which God has given us for these last days.",
