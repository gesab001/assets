    "word": "MR No. 1533 - Counsel to an Immoral Administrator in an Adventist Institution\n\n     (Written April 30, 1888, from Oakland, California, to J. D. Rice. Portions of this manuscript appear in Manuscript Release 454, Selected Messages, book 3, and Testimonies on Sexual Behavior, Adultery, and Divorce.) \n\n\n     I have had much burden of soul in your behalf, but at the same time strong confidence in God that He would on this occasion lead you to see your mistakes and errors. I so much desire that you, for your own sake and for Christ's sake, should so humble your heart by confessing your sins, that the burden shall be lifted from your soul, and the prayers of your brethren be united with your prayers, and you be healed from the wound sin has made.",
