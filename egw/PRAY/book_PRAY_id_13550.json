    "word": "A reckless disregard for souls has been manifested by the church at Ligonier. Many cherish the spirit of the self-righteous Pharisees, who sought to be first in everything. They loved the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues; but they shut up the kingdom of heaven against men, neither going in themselves nor permitting others to enter. They for a pretense made long prayers, but secretly devoured widows' houses. They paid tithes of mint and anise and cummin, but neglected the weightier matters of the law--judgment, mercy, and the love of God. They appeared to love the truth and to be very zealous for the cause of God, while their hearts were unsubdued, unsanctified, and unhumbled, open to envy, jealousy, hatred, and malice.",
