    "word": "In every mail that goes to Australia I send a letter to Stephen Belden, with copies of letters that I have written to others.  If I happen to miss a mail, he feels this deeply.  Just now I am sending him all that I can; for I fear that each mail that goes will be the last in which I can send him anything.  Poor man, he is dying of cancer, and I am so far away that I cannot be near to help him.  But I can write to him, and I can pray for him.  -- Letter 348, 1906.",
