    "word": "God knows the end from the beginning. He is acquainted with the hearts of all men. He reads every secret of the soul. He knows whether those for whom prayer is offered would or would not be able to endure the trials that would come upon them should they live. He knows whether their lives would be a blessing or a curse to themselves and to the world. This is one reason why, while presenting our petitions with earnestness, we should say, \u201cNevertheless not my will, but Thine, be done.\u201d Luke 22:42.\u2014(Ministry of Healing, 229, 230.)",
