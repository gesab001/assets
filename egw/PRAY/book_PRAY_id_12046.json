    "word": "Bro. Bell delights in his work. His thoughts, his hopes, and his prayers, are in it, that he may make his efforts highly successful, and accomplish permanent good. It is his ambition to inspire his pupils with a spirit of cheerful, voluntary industry in study. Such interest and devotion are rare, and should be appreciated by his pupils, and by all who have an interest in the welfare and progress of their children. \n                                                                           2\nBro. Bell prizes more highly the improvement of his pupils than he does the wages he receives for his labor. Had Bro. Bell confined himself to this branch of his labor in Battle Creek, for which he was so well adapted, it would have been better for him, and better for the church.",
