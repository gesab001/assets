    "word": "Chicago (?), October 23, 1878--We left Battle Creek Wednesday, October 23. Found Brother Armstrong waiting for us. Took a streetcar after walking a quarter of a mile with our baggage. We rode about five miles to the home of Brother Armstrong. We found a cheerful fire in the sitting room. This was our sleeping room. After social conversation we had a season of prayer and retired feeling we were blessed indeed.--Ms. 5, 1878, p. 1. (Diary entry.)",
