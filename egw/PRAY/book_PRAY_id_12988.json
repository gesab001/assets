    "word": "No matter what sort of education you have had in your life, or however stern it may have been, you must become as a little child, and in mind and spirit you must put yourself on a level with that little child, that you may be a proper instructor. You must understand that its trials are greater to it than yours are to you. You must know that when God would have you correct a child, you must never lay hold of the child suddenly and shake him as a terrier does a rat. No. But take him alone and pray with him, and talk with him instead of forcing your will upon him. Show him the will of Christ. And, if you do not bind that child to your own heart before you get through, you will have an entirely different experience than I have had. \n\n\n                                   -59-",
