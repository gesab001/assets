    "word": "In answer to prayer, God's care for his servant has been evinced again and again in raising him up from an apparently hopeless condition, physically and mentally. In the hurry of labor and the pressure of business, there has been much wear and work, but less spirituality. The meekness and love of Christ have been greatly lacking. A spirit of hurry has driven away the sweet spirit of Christ. More would have been done in the end, and in a much better manner, had more calmness been manifested, \n                                                                           36\nand true kindness and respect shown for all the servants of God who are laboring to advance the cause. God is never in a hurry. While the work should be pushed forward with persevering energy, it might better move more slowly than to be carried on in a spirit of hurry and friction, nervousness, and severe reprimands, which bring confusion and great unhappiness.",
