    "word": "I begged of Jesus to forbid that there should be any discord among the shepherds, for then the flock would be scattered as sheep without a shepherd. I prayed Jesus to encircle them now in His lovely arms. I saw that the disunion between the shepherds had affected the flock. Then I saw that in the scattering time when paper after paper was dying, Brother Bates wrote \n\n\n                                    -251- \n\nfor them until the last, and now in the gathering time when precious souls that have been hid beneath the rubbish and have not had the privilege of hearing the truth, need light from different ones, his testimony has been withheld. I saw that if ever the saints could be benefited by comforting words and the truth made clear in the paper, it is now in the gathering. God wanted the papers to cease in the scattering time, but now the truth should be sung, preached, prayed, and published. Then I saw we must drink deep, deep from the water of the fountain. Said the angel, Ye must reflect the lovely image of Jesus more and more. I saw that we were almost home, to rest in the city 1,000 years. Said the angel, \"Ye must love one another as Jesus hath loved you.\"",
