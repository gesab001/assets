    "word": "This morning, or rather at twelve o'clock, I rose to adjust my blinds, which were being blown by the wind; and I found the manuscript which I was to read before leaving on the six o'clock train for San Francisco, where I am to unite with Elder Corliss in labor during the week of prayer. With this manuscript was a letter from you to W. C. W. [White], which I read at midnight. This letter was of special interest to me, and after reading it, I could not think of sleeping; so I dressed, and am in my writing chair at this moment. . . .",
