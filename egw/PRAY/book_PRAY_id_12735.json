    "word": "Our Children are the Lord's property; they have been bought with a price. This thought should be the mainspring of our labors for them. The most successful method of assuring their salvation, and keeping them out of the way of temptation, is to instruct them constantly in the word of God. And as parents become learners with their children, they will find their own growth in a knowledge of the truth more rapid. Unbelief will disappear; faith and activity will increase; assurance and confidence will deepen as they thus follow on to know the Lord. Their prayers will undergo a transformation, becoming more earnest and sincere. Christ is the Head of His church, the dependence of His people; He will give the needed grace to those who seek Him for wisdom and instruction.",
