    "word": "My brethren and sisters, do we realize the importance of this subject? Why are we so listless? Why are we satisfied to remain so poorly fitted to work for the uplifting of humanity? Why is not every entrusted capability used for the Master? Why are so many contented with the feeble, lifeless condition of our churches? The heavenly universe is looking with amazement upon our Christless work. Neglect is seen in all our borders. Slipshod work is tolerated and passed by. How long shall this continue? Shall we not arise, and with determined, harmonious effort take up our responsibilities, laboring in Christ's lines with sanctified capabilities? Put away the controversial spirit which you have been educating yourselves in for years. Educate yourselves to pray to God in sincerity and truth. Sing with the spirit and understanding also. Much is expected of us.",
