    "word": "Several of our friends who were going to Iowa and Michigan accompanied us across the plains, so there were thirteen in our party. From Mojave to Kansas City there were only two or three other passengers in the car, and as these readily consented, we erected the altar of prayer, and held religious service on the Sabbath. From time to time some of the train men would drop in and listen. One day my attention was attracted to a young man who appeared very uneasy during the service. At one time he would seem almost ready to weep, and again would manifest great pleasure. He afterward stated to one of our number that it was the first prayer he had heard for five years; yet in the home of his youth, prayer was offered by his parents daily.",
