    "word": "I feel very solemn as I read the two last Testimonies, numbers 31 and 32. Will you please read these Testimonies again, for you may have forgotten some of the important appeals and warnings which they contain. If God has indeed spoken unto us, let us not turn away our hearts and ears from hearing the truth. Read in Testimony 31 the last three chapters, \"The Seal of the Living God,\" \"An Appeal,\" and \"Christian Unity.\" Then you will see if those Testimonies do not sound the same notes of warning that are now being sounded. Please read these Testimonies carefully and prayerfully.",
