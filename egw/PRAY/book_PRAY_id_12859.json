He got his arm around her and made his prayer to God with his resolves that they would seek God daily and earnestly watch against the temptations of Satan. He put his arms around me and talked and prayed and wept. Salvation indeed had come to that house. He then accompanied [me] home. I did not sleep much last night and feel worn this morning, but very thankful that we broke through the cloud of darkness last night and obtained the victory. I was determined not to give over the struggle till victory came. I never saw Edson so deeply exercised before and so sensible to his danger and \n\n\n                                    -30- \n\nweakness.
