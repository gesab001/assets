May 2, 1889 \nDear Brother Fargo: \n\n\n     I have been reading the letter of Elder Butler's written in answer to the letter I wrote to him just before the Week of Prayer. In that letter he made the statement that the position I took at the General Conference nearly broke the heart of my ministering brethren, and he thought the wound was not healed and never would be healed. He stated to me that Eld. Goodrich and Eld. Fargo and some of my very best friends had made this statement to him.",
