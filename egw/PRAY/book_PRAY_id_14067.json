    "word": "We are to despair at nothing in the line of progression. Moral and spiritual perfection through the grace and power of Christ, is promised to all who believe. At every step we are to call for the help of Christ. He is the model we are to follow in character-building. He calls for deeds, not words, saying, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in \n\n\n                                     -130- \n\nheaven.\" \"Do unto others as ye would they should do unto you\"--this is to be our rule of conduct. Christ is the source of light, the fountain of life. He brings us to His Word, and from the tree of life presents to us leaves for the healing of the nations. It is His purpose that human beings, purified and sanctified, shall be His helping hand. He leads us to the throne of God, and gives us a prayer to offer to Him. When we live this prayer, we are brought into close contact with Christ; at every step we touch His living power. In our behalf He sets in operation the all-powerful agencies of heaven.",
