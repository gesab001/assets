    "word": "Thursday, April 6, 1876, Oakland, California, Ellen White to James White \n\n\n     (Continuation of letter started on April 4.) I have had much freedom in prayer and sweet communion with God in my waking hours at night and early in the morning. I am gaining some strength, but find that any taxation affects me seriously so that it takes time to recover from it. My trust is in God. I have confidence that He will help me in my efforts to get out the truth and light He has given me \n\n\n                                  -12- \n\nto [give to] His people. Mary is a good help. I appreciate her. --Letter 3, 1876, p. 2.",
