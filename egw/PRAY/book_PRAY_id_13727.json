    "word": "The preaching the world needs is not only that which comes from the pulpit, but that which is seen in the everyday life; not only Bible precepts, but Christlike characters and heaven-born practices; the living, loving disciples of Jesus who have felt that it was more precious to commune with Jesus than to have the most exalted positions and praise of men; hearts that are daily feeling the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ, that are made strong and tender by inward conflict and secret prayer, and whose lives though humble are eloquent with holy deeds--these are the kind of workers \n\n\n                                     -74- \n\nthat will win souls to Jesus. In our ministry we must reveal Christ to the people, for they have heard Christless sermons all their lives.",
