    "word": "I think that even in England a good work has been done. It must be acknowledged to be a hard and trying field, and not one word of discouragement ought to be spoken. The Lord is at the helm and if we do not trust in Him to work, naught will be done. There is a good beginning made. Publications have been and still are doing a good work. Let not one grain of unbelief be sown for unless we keep a brave front, we cannot expect to inspire others with courage. I am telling everything I can in relation to the mission that will inspire confidence. When I think how slow the work has gone in [New] England and how little done in Mass., and Maine and many other places where they have all circumstances in their favor we need not be discouraged in regard to Old England. With the same amount of labor expended on Old England in a wise manner it will produce, I believe, good results. May the Lord work is my prayer. And let us look at every token of good; acknowledge all the Lord has done with grateful hearts. . . .",
