    "word": "One brother in a prominent position in the Chicago mission had been so weighted down with discouragement that we all feared that he would separate from the work, but he was present at that meeting and was greatly blessed. He said that he came to that meeting, heavy in heart and under a dark cloud, but the Lord Jesus met him while bowed in prayer. We had called them forward, but he did not come; but the Lord met him. \"I seemed to have the Lord Jesus close beside me,\" he said. \"How lovely, how precious; I thought I could reach Him. I knew Jesus was by my side.\" And then he broke out in a description of Christ as seen by the eye of faith. He was a man very reticent, but of few words; but his tongue was loosed, his language was eloquent, as he expressed the attributes of Christ as He was revealed to him. Said he, \"I am as light as a feather, I am happy in God, and I want to get back to Chicago and tell them what the Lord has wrought for me.\" Others bore testimony of the power of the Holy Spirit that came upon them.--Ms 2, 1891, pp. 1, 2.
