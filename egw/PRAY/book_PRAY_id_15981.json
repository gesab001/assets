    "word": "\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it. If ye love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world can not receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him; but ye see Him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.\"",
