    "word": "I spoke at the commencement of the Sabbath in the college building, and not a few tears were shed. I prayed with them, and the Lord indited prayer. I seemed to fasten upon the promises of God with faith. I never pitied the youth as I do now. There seems to be so little moral power in our world to withstand and resist temptation. My heart is drawn out in yearning tenderness for youth and children. I long to see them fastening their hopes upon Jesus, and possessing that joy and grace which will enable them to be ever cheerful, ever hopeful, full of joy because they may come to such a precious Redeemer. He will be their strength and righteousness, and clothe them with His salvation.",
