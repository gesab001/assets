    "word": "Seek Peace Without Compromise \n     Christ enjoins upon His followers to \"love your enemies, . . . do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\" He would have us love those who oppress us and do us harm. We must not express in words and acts the spirit they manifest, but improve every opportunity to do them good.",
