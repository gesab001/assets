    "word": "We are living in a most solemn, important time of this earth's history. Important and fearful events are before us. We are amid the perils of the last days. How necessary that all those that do fear God and love his law, should humble themselves before him, and be afflicted, and mourn, and confess their sins that have separated God from his people. And that which should excite the greatest alarm is that we do not feel our condition, and understand our low estate, and are satisfied to remain as we are. We should flee to the word of God and to prayer. We should make this matter our first business. We should individually seek the Lord earnestly that we may find him. The church is responsible for the talents committed to their trust, and it is impossible for Christians to meet their responsibilities unless they stand on that elevated and exalted position that is in accordance with the sacred truths which they profess. The light that shines upon our pathway holds us responsible to let that light shine forth to others in such a manner that they will glorify God.",
