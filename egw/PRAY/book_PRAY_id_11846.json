    "word": "I am very glad that so much harmonious action has been shown in striving to carry out this purpose of God, and to make the most of his providence. But let none become weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall leap if we faint not. My brethren let us have faith in God, and after we have, by sanctified energy and much prayer, done all that we can in this work for our schools, we shall see the glory of God. When the trial has been fully made, there will be a blessed result.",
