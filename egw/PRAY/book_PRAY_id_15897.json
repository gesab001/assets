    "word": "Counsellors. \n\n     Some men have insight into matters, having ability to counsel. It is a gift of God, and in moments in which the cause of God is in need of words, sound and solemn and solid, they can speak words which will lead minds perplexed and in darkness, to see as a quick flash of sunlight the course for them to pursue, which has filled them with perplexity and baffled their minds in study for weeks and months. There is an unravelling, a clearing up of the path before them and the Lord has let his sunlight in, and they see that prayers are answered, their way is made clear.",
