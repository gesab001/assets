The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness are to be reflected from His messengers upon the minds of sinners, in order that they may be led to say, with one of old, \"Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.\" Many . . . do not discern the wondrous things that are to be seen in God's law. They have not beheld that which was revealed to Moses when he prayed, \"I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.\" Exodus 33:18. To Moses was revealed God's character.",
