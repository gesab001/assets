    "word": "Yesterday morning I arose with an agony upon my soul, and I could only say, \"Lord, thou knowest all about it. My heart is burdened, and thou knowest that I cannot bear this load. I must have more help than I yet have had. Thou knowest that when I see men taking positions contrary to thy word, I am crushed under the load, and I can do nothing without thy help.\" It seemed that as I prayed a wave of light fell about me, and a voice said, \"I will be with thee to strengthen thee.\" Since then I have been resting in Jesus. I can hide in him. I am not going to carry this load any longer. I shall lay it down at the feet of my Redeemer.",
