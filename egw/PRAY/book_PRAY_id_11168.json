    "word": "At this time men need to think under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and they need to pray more and talk less; for souls are hanging in the balance. The one who has exercised masterly power in the medical missionary work has not been given permission to exercise this power. He has taken this power to himself. Heaven is grieved because acts so imperious and unadvised and often so oppressive are done. Christ has looked upon the kingly dictation as to what shall be and what shall not be, and He says: \"Speak words that are more appropriate. Men and women are My heritage. I have not passed them over into your hands. Stand aside, and exercise your authority over yourself. I have given to My children their code and charter. For man to interfere with My heritage, or to harm one of My purchased possession, is to impugn the divine efficacy and efficiency. Those who assume such authoritative power are to be rebuked for their presumption.",
