    "word": "From this time my health improved decidedly. I spoke in Washington, D. C., eight times commencing with Sabbath and closing the next Sabbath. I went to Baltimore on Sunday and spoke in a small hall full of people with great freedom. Then I had a severe attack with my head and was obliged to hasten home. As soon as I reached home, the pain left me, and I found that I was needed here. I spoke here Friday and Sabbath with great freedom. The Lord had been working here the Sabbath before, and the work here needed my testimony. Eld. Smith has fallen on the Rock and is broken. Praise the Lord for this! He has made humble acknowledgements, and the Lord will surely manifest himself to Eld. Smith. O, I am so glad that Satan's power is broken here in Battle Creek. I tell you there has been a resistance of my testimony. By some men of influence, such as Eld. Smith, there has been a counteracting of the messages that God has given to me for his people. The Lord is at work, and I pray that it may not cease till it shall be perfected in righteousness. I tell you the Lord is not asleep; he knows the conflicts of his people. He sees the multitudes struggling against the powers of evil angels combined with evil men. The truth for this time is invested with a power which will make itself felt upon human minds, for the Spirit accompanies and gives it effect.",
