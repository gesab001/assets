    "word": "WE DO NOT VALUE THE POWER OF PRAYER AS WE SHOULD.\u2014We do not value the power and efficacy of prayer as we should. Prayer and faith will do what no power on earth can accomplish. We are seldom, in all respects, placed in the same position twice. We continually have new scenes and new trials to pass through, where past experience cannot be a sufficient guide. We must have the continual light that comes from God.\u2014(Ministry of Healing, 509.)",
