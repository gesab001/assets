    "word": "Through divine strength the weakest saint is more than a match for him and all his angels, and if brought to the test [the weakest saint] would be able to prove . . . superior power.

He does not venture to show himself openly, lest he arouse the Christian\u2019s dormant energies and send him or her to God in prayer.",
