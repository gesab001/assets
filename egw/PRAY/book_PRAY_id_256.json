    "word": "The first impulse of the disciples was to go to Him; but He had bidden them tarry there, watching unto prayer. When Jesus came to them, He found them still sleeping. . . . His presence aroused them. They saw His face marked with the bloody sweat of agony, and they were filled with fear. His anguish of mind they could not understand. \u201cHis visage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men.\u201d Isaiah 52:14.",
