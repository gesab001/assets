    "word": "Letter to Capt. Henry Norman\n     Women Should Receive Suitable Pay for Their Work.--My Brother in Christ Jesus:  I feel very grateful to my heavenly Father, who has answered our prayers in His own time and His own way. Often in our experience we have been brought into very strait places, but the Lord has answered our petitions, and has greatly blessed us. Again and again we have presented our case before the Lord, wrestling as did Jacob before he met his brother Esau. Some months ago the assurance was given me to call upon our brethren in America for help. The Lord said,\n107\n\"Continue to pray, continue to ask. I will move upon hearts, and means will come in the way I have appointed.\"  Since receiving this communication from the Lord, I have felt no distrust. I have awakened in the night season with these words upon my lips: the gold and silver is the Lord's, and He will not fail us in our emergency.",
