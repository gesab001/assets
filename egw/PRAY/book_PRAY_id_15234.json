He could not keep the glad tidings, and enjoy \n                                                                           1461\nalone the privilege of following Jesus. He knew that his companion Nathanael was searching the prophecies; they had prayed most earnestly to understand the Scriptures; but where was Nathanael? He was then praying to God under a fig-tree. Philip discovered his retreat, for they had often prayed together in this secluded spot, hidden by the foliage. As soon as Philip found his friend, he declared, \"We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" But Nathanael had heard what a wicked place Nazareth was, and this statement aroused his prejudice. He queried, \"Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?\" Philip entered into no controversy, but said, \"Come and see.\" Thus the truth came to Nathanael. As he listened to the words of Christ, faith, simple, full, and complete, was expressed. Jesus said of him, \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\" \n                                                                           1462",
