    "word": "NEHEMIAH SHAPED HIS PRAYERS TO THE NEEDS OF THE MOMENT.\u2014The recital of the condition of Jerusalem awakened the sympathy of the monarch without arousing his prejudices. Another question gave the opportunity for which Nehemiah had long waited: \u201cFor what dost thou make request?\u201d But the man of God did not venture to reply till he had sought direction from One higher than Artaxerxes. He had a sacred trust to fulfill, in which he required help from the king; and he realized that much depended upon his presenting the matter in such a way as to win his approval and enlist his aid. \u201cI prayed,\u201d he said, \u201cto the God of heaven.\u201d In that brief prayer Nehemiah pressed into the presence of the King of kings and won to his side a power that can turn hearts as the rivers of waters are turned.\u2014(Prophets and Kings, 631.)",
