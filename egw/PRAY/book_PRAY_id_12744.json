    "word": "We shall try to work hard here in this camp meeting, and shall not be able to do anything without the Lord's help. He will be with me. He will, I know that He will, for I make Him my only trust and He will help me while I work in all humility of mind. I see the necessity of constant watchfulness and unceasing prayer. My heart is drawn out after God constantly. We can do great things in His strength. The Lord will help; the Lord will strengthen, and will bless. I hope you will see your way clearly and will be strong in God to battle against every wrong and stand free in God, in the power of His grace and lowliness and meekness. You can be a great blessing to His people when divested of self. Jesus will take possession of the soul and be developed in the life and character. Perhaps I feel too much but I do feel to the very depths the great work to be done and the few to engage in this great work. I am in continual fear I shall not act well my part and do all that I might do. The Lord does help me in the Testimonies, that I know. I could not, no, I could not of myself do this work. I trust to the Lord to take care of you.",
