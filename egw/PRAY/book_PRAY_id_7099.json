    "word": "A Few Sabbaths With the White Family \n\n\n     [Battle Creek, Michigan] Sabbath, January 1, 1859. Attended Preaching, a Baptism, and the Ordinances.--It is the commencement of the new year. The Lord gave James liberty Sabbath afternoon in preaching upon the necessary preparation for baptism, and to partake of the Lord's Supper. There was much feeling in the congregation. At intermission, all repaired to the water, where seven followed their Lord in baptism. It was a powerful season and of the deepest interest. Two little sisters about eleven years old were baptized. One, Cornelia C., prayed in the water to be kept unspotted from the world.",
