    "word": "I am so thankful to see with our ministering brethren a disposition to search the Scriptures for themselves. There has been a very great lack of deep searching of the Scriptures, storing the mind with the gems of truth. How much we all lose because we do not put to the tax our minds to search with much prayer for divine enlightenment to understand His holy Word. I believe there will be a decided advance among our people, a more earnest endeavor to keep pace with the third angel's message. Ms 10, 1889, p. 1.
