    "word": "Study the tenth chapter of Daniel, and mark particularly the fourteenth verse. \"Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days\" (Daniel 10:14). When our brethren and ministers shall feel the burden that should rest upon them, they will not be content with a few surface truths. They will sink the shaft deep, and will have the spirit that Daniel possessed. There will be no frivolous spirit: no cheap, superficial sanctification, prated from unsanctified lips, and coming from hearts that are destitute of purity, of consecration and wholehearted surrender to God. There will be earnest prayer that the truth may be so indelibly stamped upon the heart, that the entire man may be brought, with all his ways, into conformity to the truth. \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\" (Romans 10:10).",
