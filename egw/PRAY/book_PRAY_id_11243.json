    "word": "\"Floating rumors are often the destroyers of unity among brethren. There are some who watch with open mind and ears to catch flying scandal. They gather up little incidents which may be trifling in themselves, but which are repeated and exaggerated until a man is made an offender for a word. Their motto seems to be, 'Report, and we will report it.' These tale-bearers are doing Satan's work with surprising fidelity, little knowing how offensive their course is to God. . . . The door of the mind should be closed against, 'They say,' or, 'I have heard.' Why should we not, instead of allowing jealousy or evil surmising to come into our hearts, go to our brethren, and after frankly but kindly setting before them the things we have heard detrimental to their character and influence, pray with and for them? While we can not fellowship with those who are the bitter enemies of Christ, we should cultivate that spirit of meekness and love that characterized our Master,-- a love that thinketh no evil, and is not easily provoked. . . .",
