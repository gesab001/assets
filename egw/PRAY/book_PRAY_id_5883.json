    "word": "As Nehemiah prayed, his faith and courage grew strong. His mouth was filled with holy arguments. He pointed to the dishonor that would be cast upon God, if His people, now that they had returned to Him, should be left in weakness and oppression; and he urged the Lord to bring to pass His promise: \u201cIf ye turn unto Me, and keep My Commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set My name there.\u201d See Deuteronomy 4:29-31. This promise had been given to Israel through Moses \n149\nbefore they had entered Canaan, and during the centuries it had stood unchanged. God\u2019s people had now returned to Him in penitence and faith, and His promise would not fail.",
