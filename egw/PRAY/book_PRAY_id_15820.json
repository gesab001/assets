    "word": "God is dishonored by those who are in responsible places of stewardship, yet do not realize the necessity of being, both in spirit and words, an example to those connected with them, who have learned to do as they require. Every one must have the grace of God for his own soul, he must confide in the pardoning mercy of God through the merits of Christ. Then he will not manifest a harsh zeal to bruise and wound, but a sanctified zeal \n                                                                           412\nto answer the prayer of Christ, which he offered before his crucifixion, zeal not for human uplifting, but for the glory of God.",
