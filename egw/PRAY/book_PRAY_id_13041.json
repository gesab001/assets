I have read it, and I \n\n\n                                    -286- \n\nwill say that I have always talked against the idea of having a consumptives' home near the Boulder Sanitarium. Select a place ten or twelve miles away, or if necessary, still farther away. If possible, let it be where there are many pine trees. Let those of the patients who are able to work be given something to do. They should give the muscles judicious exercise. Let them work in the soil. This will be found especially advantageous. Let all be taught that cheerfulness is God's remedy for sickness. Let them talk faith, and think as little as possible about disagreeable things. Let the heart go forth in praise and thanksgiving to God. Let them pray for themselves and for one another, and let them keep the love of God in the soul. The great Physician can heal consumption. He did it in the case of my husband and myself.",
