Sleeping ministers preach to sleeping people.--By tamely presenting the truth, merely repeating the theory without being stirred by it themselves, they can never convert men.

They must show by their manners, by their acts and words, and by their preaching and praying, that they believe that Christ is at the door. Men and women are in the last hours of probation, and yet are careless and stupid, and preachers have no power to arouse them; they are asleep themselves.
