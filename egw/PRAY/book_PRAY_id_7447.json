    "word": "Christ's two days' delay after hearing that Lazarus was sick was not a neglect or a denial on His part. . . . This should be an encouragement to us. . . . We are to rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him. The answer to our prayers may not come as quickly as we desire, and it may not be just what we have asked; but He who knows what is for the highest good of His children will bestow a much greater good than we have asked, if we do not become faithless and discouraged.",
