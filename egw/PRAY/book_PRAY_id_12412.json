    "word": "If our ministers go into a place and first come to the shepherds of the flock, and are friendly, and sociable, it may have an excellent effect upon them, and leave a favorable impression in regard to the truth upon their minds. At any rate it is fair and right to give them an opportunity to be favorable and kind if they will. If by earnest prayerful, Christlike efforts, you can bring one minister into the truth, you, through his influence, may be able to convert a score of souls.",
