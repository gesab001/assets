    "word": "Time is rapidly passing into eternity. Will any now keep back from God that which is strictly His own? Will any refuse Him that which, though it may be given without merit, cannot be denied without ruin? The Lord has given to every man his work, and the holy angels want us to be doing that work. As you shall watch and pray and work, they stand ready to co-operate with you. When the understanding is worked upon by the Holy Spirit, then all the affections act harmoniously in compliance with the divine will. Then men will give to God His own, saying: \"All things come of Thee, and of Thine own we freely give Thee.\" May God forgive His people that they have not done this.",
