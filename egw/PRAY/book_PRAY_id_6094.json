    "word": "The way to the throne of God is always open. You cannot always be on your knees in prayer, but your silent petitions may constantly ascend to God for strength and guidance. When tempted, as you will be, you may flee to the secret place of the Most High. His everlasting arms will be underneath you. Let these words cheer you, \u201cThou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy.\u201d Revelation 3:4.\u2014(Counsels on Health, 362.)",
