    "word": "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. The eye of faith will discern God very near, and the suppliant may obtain precious evidence of the divine love and care for him. But why is it that so many prayers are never answered? . . . The Lord gives us the promise: \"Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart\" (Jeremiah 29:13). Again, He speaks of some who \"have not cried unto me with their heart\" (Hosea 7:14). Such petitions are prayers of form, lip service only, which the Lord does not accept. . . .",
