    "word": "When in Australia, Brother Kress, you lay trembling between life and death.-- Was the message given me for you, Return to a diet of flesh meats? No, no. God gave you directions regarding a healthful diet, which if diligently followed, would, mingled with the exercise of faith and prayer, save your life. The Lord foresaw that as a physician in one of our sanitariums, you would be a teacher of the principles of health reform. You were working hard, Dr. Kress, and you did not give yourself proper rest and nourishment. The Lord permitted you to come to the very brink of collapse that you might be guided by his instruction. He has never bidden any minister or physician to break down the barrier of correct eating in order to save life.",
