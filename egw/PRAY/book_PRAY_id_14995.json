    "word": "March 11. Dear Children: My heart is filled with thanksgiving and praise to God. The Lord has poured upon us His blessing. The backbone of the rebellion is broken in those who have come in from other places. This morning the room was full. We first had prayer, then Brother Olsen spoke; I followed in the same line in which I have been laboring since one week ago last Sabbath. The Lord put words into my mouth to speak, and Elder Bourdeau spoke well. Elder Waggoner spoke very humbly. Brother Steward spoke with much feeling and humility. Brother Fero spoke well. Brother Larson then spoke and confessed that his feeling had not been right. I responded and he took his position on the testimonies.",
