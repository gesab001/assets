    "word": "This class of work has gone out of fashion. Let it be once more brought into practice. The fields are white all ready to harvest. The Lord desires many more to go out into the harvest field. He will be with those who study His Word and obey His commands. He will impart to them His grace. Go forth in the name of Christ, remembering that He is your companion, that every prayer, every word, every song, is heard by Him. The message of the soon coming of the Lord with power and great glory will bring conviction to many hearts.--Review and Herald, Feb. 4, 1904.",
