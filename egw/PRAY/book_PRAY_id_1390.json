    "word": "Let the youth take heed to the words of the wise man, \"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\" Let them walk softly, prayerfully, and carefully before the Lord, in continual dependence upon Him, and at the same time exerting all their powers, improving all their opportunities, trusting to what the Lord can do with their consecrated abilities. Let them inquire at every step, \"Is this the way of the Lord?\" Humility is a characteristic of those who have true wisdom, and no matter what may be their attainments, they will not be self-confident and boastful.",
