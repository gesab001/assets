    "word": "Reverence in Prayer \n\n     Some think it a mark of humility to pray to God in a common manner, as if talking with a human being. They profane His name by needlessly and irreverently mingling with their prayers the words, \"God Almighty,\"--awful, sacred words, which should never pass the lips except in subdued tones and with a feeling of awe. \n                                                                           177",
