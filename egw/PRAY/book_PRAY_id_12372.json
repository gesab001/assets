    "word": "We must treat with tenderness those who make it hard work to believe. If they once get hold of that faith that works by love and purifies the soul, what a joy will come into their experience! We must pity them and pray for them. But no tartness of expression must be revealed; not a discouraging word must come from our lips to any soul that lives. We cannot tell what harm may result from a word spoken unadvisedly. \"Love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous.\" . . . If we melt into the love of Christ, if we become as little children, we are more sure of entering heaven.--Letter 121, 1898, pp. 3, 4. (To Elder and Mrs. S. N. Haskell, Dec. 12, 1898.)",
