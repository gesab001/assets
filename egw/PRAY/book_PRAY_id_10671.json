    "word": "In order for us to be like the Saviour, we must be changed (see Philippians 3:20, 21). Now is the time for us to bring into the daily life the virtues of Christ's life. We have no time to lose. Should we fail in our character building, we shall lose eternal life. We must build on the true foundation. . . .
