    "word": "We returned to Portland, and then visited Topsham. Sister Frances Howland was very sick with rheumatic fever. She was under the doctor's care. Her hands were so swollen that we could not see the joints. Bro. Howland was asked if he had faith that F. could be healed in answer to prayer. He said, \"I will believe.\" Again he was asked, \"Do you believe?\" He answered, \"I do.\" Then prayer was offered to God in her behalf. We claimed the promise, \"Ask and ye shall receive.\" \n                                                                           43\nSister F. was in the chamber above. She had not stood on her feet for two weeks. The Spirit of the Lord indited prayer. We had the assurance of God's willingness to heal the afflicted one. Bro. D. cried out in the Spirit, and power of God, \"Is there some sister here who has faith enough to go and take her by the hand, and bid her arise in the name of the Lord?\" Sister C. was on her way as the words were spoken. She ascended the stairs with the Spirit of the Lord upon her, and took F. by the hand, saying, \"Sister Frances, in the name of the Lord arise and be whole.\" Sister F. acted out her faith, rose from her bed and stood upon her feet, and walked the room praising the Lord that she was healed. She dressed and came down into the room where we were, her countenance lighted up with the blessing of God.",
