    "word": "It is very necessary that we should pray in order that we may have strength from above to see and resist the temptations of the \n242\nenemy; but Satan ever seeks to prevent men from praying, by filling up their time with business or pleasure, or by leading them into such wickedness that they will have no desire to pray. The Lord Jesus has made heaven accessible to all who will come unto Him, and He invites the children and the youth to come. He said, \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.\u201d Jesus would have the children and the youth come to Him with the same confidence with which they go to their parents. As a child asks his mother or father for bread when he is hungry, so the Lord would have you ask Him for the things which you need. If your sins are heavy upon your heart, you are to come to God and say, \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, forgive my sins.\u201d Every sincere prayer will be heard in heaven, and every earnest petition for grace and strength will be answered.\u2014(The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 7, 1892.)",
