    "word": "While at Southampton I spoke to the church Friday evening, and twice on the Sabbath. Appointments were out for Sunday evening in a large hall; but Sunday morning found me sick with a severe cold. I could sit up but little. During the day we rode out, and I came near fainting. The brethren saw that it would be impossible for me to speak that night unless the Lord should work in a special manner. I tried to pray over the matter, and decided to do my part. I arose from the bed, rode to the hall, and stood upon my feet, and the Lord gave me strength as he had many times before under similar circumstances. \n164\nThe pain in my head ceased, the soreness in my throat was removed, and I spoke for more than an hour with perfect freedom. The Lord's name shall have all the glory. Monday morning I was able to return with our company to London, where we remained two days before going to Switzerland.",
