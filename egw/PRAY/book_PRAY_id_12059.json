Smith. \n\n                   Battle Creek, Mich., June, 1860. \n     Dear Sister Harriet: I think it is my duty to unburden my mind to you this morning. After we came home from the West you well know a burden rested upon us. We felt no union with the church generally, and have spent our Sabbaths at home. But I will go back. When we came from the East last fall I told James that I had no liberty to bear my testimony in the church at Battle Creek; but he urged me to do so. I continued to do so, but to the discouragement of my own soul; and when I prayed in the meeting-house I had so little freedom I told my husband it should be the last time. I knew not the occasion of all this. I felt the same when relating or reading a vision in Uriah's and your presence. I was reluctant to do so, and had no freedom, and felt a strange dissatisfaction.",
