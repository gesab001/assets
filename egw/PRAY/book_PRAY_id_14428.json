    "word": "Letter 127, 1895, pp. 1,4-6. (To \"Children,\" December 11, 1895.)--I commenced to write you some things in regard to Fannie, but I think it not best. The poor girl will have hard time enough in getting along. I will not make it any harder for her. I put this over the matter I commenced to write [several lines marked out], and re-page, for I take out two pages. It is enough to state Fannie has no longer any connection with me in the work. I pity her most sincerely. I fear for her soul, but I wish her no harm. She has caused me great sorrow, but may the Lord forgive her is my prayer. It is the same desire for her superior talents to be recognized. This time she has been sufficiently punished. . . .",
