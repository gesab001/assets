    "word": "At another time I carried my two sons through the typhoid fever. God was my helper. My husband would have died if I had not by faith laid hold on God. I knew that God did not want him to die, because He did not want His name dishonored. My husband's life was spared. Years afterward, when he died, my friends said, \"Oh, Sister White, do pray that he may be raised up!\" I replied, \"The Lord says, 'Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: \n\n\n                                     -51- \n\nYea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.' I do not desire the old warrior to come back to life, to die again; let him rest till the morning of the resurrection.\"",
