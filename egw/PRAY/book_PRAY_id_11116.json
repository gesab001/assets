    "word": "The Work of an Evangelist. \n\n     Teaching the Scriptures, praying in families,-- this is the work of an evangelist, and this work is to be mingled with your preaching. If it is omitted, preaching will be, to a great extent, a failure. You need to be jealous of yourself. You and your wife need to come close to the people by personal effort. Teach them that the love of God must come into the inner sanctuary of the home life. If you so desire, you may have the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit to help you in your work. \n\n\n                      - 47 -",
