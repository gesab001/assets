    "word": "\"Sunday evening, August 19, I spoke by invitation at the Sanitarium. . . . I addressed the crowded congregation from the words: 'He that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.' 1 Peter 3:10-12. . . .",
