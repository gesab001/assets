    "word": "The Lord calls upon his people to arouse, and to show their faith by their works. In times past, when our numbers were few, when those who were able felt it their duty to take stock in our publishing house, their prayers and their alms, the fruit of persevering, self-denying efforts, came before God as a sweet savor. Our brethren and sisters who have received the precious bread of life, brought to them in our publications, should be even more willing to give of their means to support the cause than were those who loved the truth in former years.",
