    "word": "Edson and Emma, win all you can, and when you need one hundred dollars more to invest in the work you have been doing, you may draw on my account at the Review and Herald office. There are those in the world who are poor, yet who make many rich. I am glad Brother Kynett and his daughter have united with you in this blessed work. God bless you and them is our daily prayer.--Letter 119, 1896, p. 7. (To Edson and Emma White, July 31, 1896.)",
