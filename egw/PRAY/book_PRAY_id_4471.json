    "word": "Understanding Minds and Human Nature Aids in Work of Salvation.--Be determined to become as useful and efficient as God calls you to be. Be thorough and faithful in whatever you undertake. Procure ever advantage within your reach for strengthening the intellect. Let the study of books be combined with useful manual labor, and by faithful endeavor, watchfulness, and prayer secure the wisdom that is from above. This will give you an all-round education. Thus you may rise in character, and gain an influence over other minds, enabling you to lead them in the path of uprightness and holiness.--COL 334 (1900).",
