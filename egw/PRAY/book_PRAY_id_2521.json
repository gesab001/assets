    "word": "The prayer which Nathanael offered while he was under the fig-tree, came from a sincere heart, and it was heard and answered by the Master. Christ said of him, \u201cBehold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\u201d [John 1:47.] The Lord reads the hearts of all, and understands their motives and purposes. \u201cThe prayer of the upright is his delight.\u201d [Proverbs 15:18.] He will not be slow to hear those who open their hearts to him, not exalting self, but sincerely feeling their great weakness and unworthiness.",
