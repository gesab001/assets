    "word": "Every feature in the life of the great Example should be studied with care.--The more that the minister of Christ associates with his Master, through contemplation of His life and character, the more closely will he resemble Him, and the better qualified will he be to teach His truths. Every feature in the life of the great Example should be studied with care, and close converse should be held with Him through the prayer of living faith. Thus will the defective human character be transformed into the image of His glorious character. Thus will the teacher of the truth be prepared to lead souls to Christ.--3SP 244.",
