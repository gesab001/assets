    "word": "Sow Beside All Waters.--If our sisters would spend their God-given time in earnest prayer to God, and the study of His Word, He would impart to them heavenly wisdom, that they might know how to labor through the grace given them of God, to save the souls of those around them. Our sisters might begin with missionary work in their own households; then they would know how to work intelligently for their neighbors. If they would become interested in this kind of work, they might be sowing the seeds of truth. We must sow beside all waters, though we know not which will prosper, this or that. This kind of work pays; for its results are as lasting as eternity. It is represented as bringing to the foundation, gold, silver, and precious stones--materials which are not consumable and perishable, but as enduring as eternity. The first work for us individually is a personal consecration to God.--RH, Nov. 6, 1888.",
