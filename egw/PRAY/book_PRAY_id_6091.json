    "word": "KNEELING NOT ALWAYS REQUIRED WHILE PRAYING.\u2014We cannot always be on our knees in prayer, but the way to the mercy seat is always open. While engaged in active labor, we may ask for help; and we are promised by One who will not deceive us, \u201cYe shall receive.\u201d The Christian can and will find time to pray. Daniel was a statesman; heavy responsibilities rested upon him; yet three times a day he sought God, and the Lord gave him the Holy Spirit. So today men may resort to the sacred pavilion of the Most High and feel the assurance of His promise, \u201cMy people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.\u201d Isaiah 32:18. All who really desire it can find a place for communion with God, where no ear can hear but the one open to the cries of the helpless, distressed, and needy\u2014the One who notices even the fall of the little sparrow. He says, \u201cYe are of more value than many sparrows.\u201d Matthew 10:31.\u2014(Counsels on Health, 423, 424.)",
