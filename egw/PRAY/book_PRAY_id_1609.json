    "word": "The cloud disappeared from the tabernacle in token of God's displeasure, and  Miriam was smitten. She \" became leprous, white as snow.\"  Aaron was spared, but he was severely rebuked in Miriam's punishment.

In respect for her high position, and in grief at the blow that had fallen upon her, the whole company abode in Hazeroth, awaiting her return.",
