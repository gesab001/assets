    "word": "Upon us as ministers God has placed a burden of solemn responsibility. Realizing that we are His chosen watchmen, we should have constant concern and forethought in regard to the state of the church. We should give much time to earnest prayer for divine wisdom and guidance in order that we may know how best to promote God's honor and glory. He has commissioned us to honor Him, the Omnipotent One, in every word and act. From Him comes our maintenance. We are wholly dependent upon His sufficiency, His bounty, for our support.",
