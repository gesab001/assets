    "word": "The harm done to the cause of truth by premature moves can never be fully repaired. The cause of God in Boston has not advanced as it might, and will not stand in as favorable light before the people as before this work was done. There are frequently persons among us whose influence seems to be but a cipher on the right side. Their lives seem to be useless; but let them become rebellious and combative, and they became zealous workmen for Satan. This work is more in accordance with the feelings of the natural heart. There is great need of self-examination and secret prayer. God has promised wisdom to those who ask him. Missionary labor is frequently entered into by those unprepared for the work. Outward zeal is cultivated while secret prayer is neglected. When this is the case, much harm is done, for these laborers seek to regulate others' consciences by their own rule. Self-control is much needed. Hasty words stir up strife. Bro. Waggoner is in danger of indulging in a spirit of sharp criticism. This does not become ministers of righteousness.",
