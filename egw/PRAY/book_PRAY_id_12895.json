    "word": "Miss Baker, a young lady, who has opposed her mother's keeping the Sabbath, attended this meeting. She is, I think, about twenty years old. Her mother has taken her stand since the camp-meeting, and is thoroughly established in the faith. Since the two days' meeting in Hamilton, she has been making every effort to reach her daughter. She had held seasons of prayer with her alone. This has had a precious influence on the daughter. We think that she will return home from this meeting fully decided to observe the Sabbath. Mr. Baker has never opposed his wife, but his daughter has kept him back from keeping the Sabbath himself. There are three sons and one daughter in the family. We hope now that both the father and the daughter will take their stand.",
