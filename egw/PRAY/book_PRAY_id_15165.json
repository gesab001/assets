    "word": "Sunday afternoon I spoke to a large congregation from John 14:1-14. Again the Lord blessed me with freedom and the \n                                                                           1097\npeople also were blessed. North Fitzroy is five miles from the school building in St. Kilda where we live, and the ride after speaking made me quite weary. I felt more anxiety, however, in regard to the affect of the malaria from the open drains which are not only offensive but dangerous to health and life. Monday evening in the school building I met with the little church of Prahran. I prayed with them and spoke with freedom from the words. \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" Then we had a prayer and social meeting in which precious testimonies were borne by nearly all present. Tuesday evening I again attended a meeting in the same place. Willie had very interesting matter to present from Elder Reed, in regard to the missionary work in the Pacific Islands. These meetings are profitable; light is shining upon us, but we want more and still more of the blessing of God.",
