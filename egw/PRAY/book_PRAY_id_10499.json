    "word": "With the full knowledge of the king's decree he [Daniel] still bows before his God, \u201chis windows being open.\u201d He considers supplication to God of sufficient importance to sacrifice his life rather than to relinquish it. On account of his praying to God he was cast into the lions\u2019 den. Evil angels accomplished their\n142\npurpose thus far. But Daniel continues to pray, even in the den of lions. . . . Did God forget him there? Oh no; Jesus the mighty Commander of the host of heaven, sent His angel to close the mouths of those hungry lions that they should not hurt the praying man of God, and all was peace in that terrible den. The king witnessed his preservation, and brought him out with honors. Satan and his angels were defeated and enraged. The agents Satan had employed were doomed to perish in the terrible manner they had plotted to destroy Daniel.\u20144bSG 85, 86.",
