    "word": "We say decidedly, every minister of Jesus Christ must bind himself to the Source of all light and power and he must not follow in the shadow of any other living man, because there is Christ to whom he must become attached, and he should not bind his heart to any human being and let man do his thinking for him. He is not filling his position in society or in the world if he simply accepts what his father has said and what his father, or some great and good man in past generations, has done, and sinks himself, his individuality, in them. Some who think that they preach the gospel are preaching other men's ideas. Through some means they have come to the decision that it is no part of a minister's calling or duty to think diligently and prayerfully. He accepts what other men have taught without asserting his individuality. This doctrine, taught by the church of Rome, is entire dependence upon the leaders. The individual's conscience is not his own. Judgment must be controlled by other men's ideas. His intelligence is to go no farther than that of those who are leaders.",
