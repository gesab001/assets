    "word": "\"The Lord wants wise men and women, acting in the capacity of nurses, to comfort and help the sick and the suffering. Through the ministration of these nurses, those who have heretofore taken no interest in religious things will be led to ask, 'What must I do to be saved?' The sick will be led to Christ by the patient attention of nurses who anticipate their wants, and who bow in prayer and ask the great Medical Missionary to look with compassion upon the sufferer, and to let the soothing influence of His grace be felt, and His restoring power be exercised.",
