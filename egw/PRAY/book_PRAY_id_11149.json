Let every minister, in the place of standing to criticize and question, to doubt and oppose, if there is the semblance of a chance to do so, be now employed in erecting barriers against the wily foes. Rather than fight against those whom the Lord has sent to save these, let his people pray fervently and continually for the power of God's grace, and that the Captain of the Lord's Host will take the field. Rather than sit in judgment upon men whom God has accepted to do him service, let the burden of their prayer be, night and day, that the Lord may send forth more laborers into his vineyard.

God knows the character. He sees the temperament of the men he has chosen. He knows that none but earnest, firm, determined, strong-feeling men will view this work in its vital importance, and will put such firmness and decision into their testimonies that they will make a break against the barriers of Satan.",
