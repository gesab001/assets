    "word": "\"Stay yourselves, and wonder, cry ye out, and cry; they are drunken but not with wine; they stagger; but not with strong drink. For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men delivered to one that is learned saying, read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned.\"",
