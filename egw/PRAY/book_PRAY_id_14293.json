    "word": "Power! Power! Our great cry is for power without measure! It awaits us. We have only to draw, to take God at His word, to act faith, to stand firmly upon the promises, to wrestle for the endowment of the grace of God. Learning is not essential, genius is not necessary, eloquence may be lacking, but the prayer of the lowly and contrite heart God hears, and when He hears no obstacles on earth can hinder. The power of God will make us effectual.--Letter 35, 1878. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nFebruary 28, 1991. Entire Letter.",
