    "word": "Holy angels have been displeased and disgusted with the irreverent manner in which they have used the name of God, the great Jehovah. Angels mention that sacred name with the greatest awe, ever veiling their faces when they speak the name of God. The name of Christ is so sacred to them they speak it with the greatest reverence. But how opposite the spirit and influence attending the 1854 time movement. Some who are still under the same influence speak of God as they would of a horse, or of any common-place thing. In their prayers they use the words God Almighty very common and irreverently. Those who do this have no sense of the exalted character of God, of Christ, or of heavenly things.",
