    "word": "Christ is wounded by the differences that are so easily created and brought to the front. Turn to the seventeenth chapter of John, and read the prayer of Christ, His entreaty that His disciples may be one as He is one with the Father. We greatly dishonor God when we regard it as a light matter to make our differences apparent. This is sure to weaken our own souls and the souls of others. . . .",
