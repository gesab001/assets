    "word": "The will of God in regard to His people is plainly expressed in the sixth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth chapters of John.

I tell you that souls are sick and in need of a physician, but they think themselves whole, and in place of humbling themselves before God as a little child they are trying to humble someone else. If they would live the prayer of Christ, the sure result would be realized--unity with one another and with Christ.",
