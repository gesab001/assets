    "word": "44 (Philippians 2:5-8; Hebrews 2:14-17). Christ Took No Make-believe Humanity.--Of Christ it is said, \"And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.\" We need to realize the truth of Christ's manhood in order to appreciate the truth of the above words. It was not a make-believe humanity that Christ took upon Himself. He took human nature and lived human nature. Christ worked no miracles in His own behalf. He was compassed with infirmities, but His divine nature knew what was in man. He needed not that any should testify to Him of this. The Spirit was given Him without measure; for His mission on earth demanded this.",
