    "word": "Develop Highest Motives for Advancement.--Those in training to be nurses and physicians should daily be given instruction that will develop the highest motives for advancement. They should attend our colleges and training schools; and the teachers in these institutions of learning should realize their responsibility to work with and pray with the students. In these schools, students should learn to be true medical missionaries, firmly bound up with the gospel ministry.--SpT Series B, No. 11, p 12, Nov 14, 1905.",
