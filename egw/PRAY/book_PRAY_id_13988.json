    "word": "The talents God has given men and women are not all alike, for He would have one supply the need of the other. He desires His workers to help one another in the discharge of their various duties and the thorough accomplishment of the work to which He calls them. It is only as we follow Christ with fidelity that we can do the work essential to be done to prepare a people to meet their Lord. The more men pray and believe and follow the directions of the Lord, the more perfectly will they use their talents in the accomplishment of His work. Men may accept a form of religion, but if pride, selfishness, and self-indulgence unite them with the world and its pleasures and amusements, their religion makes them worse instead of better; for they travel the broad road with a false sense of religious security. \"He that will come after Me,\" Christ declared, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.\"",
