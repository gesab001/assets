    "word": "To every Christian comes the word that was addressed to Peter, \"Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" Luke 22:31. Thank God we are not left alone. This is our safety. Satan can never touch with eternal disaster one whom Christ has prepared for temptation by His previous intercession; for grace is provided in Christ for every soul, and a way of escape has been made, so that no one need fall under the power of the enemy.",
