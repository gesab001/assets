    "word": "I have a most earnest desire that you shall stand free in the Lord. I pray that you may have the moral courage to stand firm for the truth, and to hold fast the beginning of your confidence unto the end. Do not allow yourself to be led away from truth to receive fables. It is of no avail to bring to the foundation material represented by wood, hay, and stubble. Such material will be utterly consumed. Let us remember that we have been bought at an infinite price by the Son of God. Our physicians must not allow themselves to be held in control by another man's mind, as they have been, fearing to open their lips to differ with their chief.",
