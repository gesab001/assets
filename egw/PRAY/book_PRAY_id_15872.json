    "word": "Many will be laid away to sleep in Jesus before the fiery ordeal of the time of trouble shall come upon our world. This is another reason why we should say after our earnest petition, \"Nevertheless, not my will, but Thine, O Lord, be done.\" Such a petition will never be registered in heaven as a faithless prayer. The Apostle was bidden to write: \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; Yea saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.\" From this we can see that every one is not to be judged as unworthy of eternal life. If Jesus, the world's Redeemer, prayed, \"O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,\" and then added, \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt,\" how very appropriate is it for poor, finite mortals to make surrender to the wisdom and will of God. \n\n\n                                   -7-",
