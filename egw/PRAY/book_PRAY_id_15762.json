    "word": "If a faithful work had been done during the last few years that have gone into eternity, thousands of souls would now be found with Bibles in their hands, reading the Word of God, and praying for light and guidance. Many of these would be engaged in the work of hunting for souls, and fitting up a people to stand in the great day of God. But some who ought to be missionaries, are filled with the spirit of commercialism, and with an ambition to secure for themselves certain advantages. The truth becomes to them a dead letter, not practiced nor obeyed.",
