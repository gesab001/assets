    "word": "Let the eye be fixed on the Sun of righteousness. Do not make your dear, loving heavenly Father a tyrant; but see His tenderness, His pity, His large, broad love, and His great compassion. His love exceeds that of a mother for her child. The mother may forget, \"yet will I not forget thee\" (Isaiah 49:15), saith the Lord. Jesus wants you to trust Him. May His blessing rest upon you in a rich measure is my earnest prayer.",
