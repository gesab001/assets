    "word": "The Lord was testing Solomon. He placed in his mind a desire for the things that would enable him to rule wisely the people of Israel . . . . [Verses 7-9 quoted.] It was such a prayer as this that Solomon was continually to offer in the days of exaltation and glory awaiting him. And thus those who today are standing in positions of trust in the Lord's work are to pray. Let them beware of lifting up their hearts unto vanity. Only the prayers of those whose hearts are not filled with self-exaltation and haughtiness will the Lord hear. [Isaiah 58:9 quoted.]",
