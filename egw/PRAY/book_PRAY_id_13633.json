    "word": "September 25. In the evening we had a ministers' meeting. I had feared that Daniel would not be present, but he came into the meeting. I opened the meeting with prayer. The spirit of earnest intercession was upon me, and the power of God was in our midst. Daniel prayed after me; he began to break and confess. We had a remarkable meeting. All prayed with weeping and humiliation of soul and hearty confessions.",
