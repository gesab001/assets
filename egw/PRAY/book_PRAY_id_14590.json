    "word": "We need experienced workers in the cause of God. It is not necessary that they all know several languages, but they do all need an experience in the things of God. Some who go to foreign countries will need to learn a language, but all need not spend time in learning languages that they will never use. We have not time to spend years in studying subjects that will be of no practical value. We are not to think that we must climb to the highest rounds of knowledge on every science. Time is short, and we must labor earnestly to save souls. If we will take the Word of God, and study it diligently and prayerfully, we will find the light and the knowledge that we need.",
