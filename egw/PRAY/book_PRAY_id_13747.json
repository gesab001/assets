    "word": "Bear in mind that if we commit iniquity, if we cherish deception and falsehood, if we deal unfairly in order to bring gain to ourselves, the Lord cannot hear our prayers, and we shall remain weak and unsatisfied. Cleanse the heart of self and hatred, and let love for souls rule, even for those souls who have dealt with you unjustly and dishonestly. They need all the pity you can give them, for they will receive according to their works.-- Letter 156, 1899. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. June 4, 1987. Entire Letter.",
