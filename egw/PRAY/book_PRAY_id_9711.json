    "word": "Shimei comes forth as David passes and, with a storm of curses, hurls against him invectives, throwing stones and dirt. Said one of David's faithful men, \"Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.\"  David in his sorrow and humility says, \"Let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. . . . Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life\" (2 Samuel 16:9-11).",
