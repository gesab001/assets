    "word": "We have been engaged in earnest prayer before God about two hours, that the cloud of discouragement that has been settling upon our souls might be broken and the light of God's Spirit come upon us. We have had a severe struggle. We have felt as did Jacob of old when he wrestled with the angel--we will not let Thee go except Thou bless us. The presence of God seemed to be in our midst. Our trembling faith grasped the promise of God, \"What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\" Mark 11:24.",
