    "word": "All who engage in this personal labor should be just as careful not to become mechanical in their manner of work as should the minister who preaches the word. They should be constantly learning. They should have a conscientious zeal to obtain the highest qualifications, to become able men in the Scriptures. They should not accumulate expensive furniture and become fixtures in any one place; for they know not how soon they may be called to other fields. They should not gather burdens about them so that their thoughts and time will be occupied in serving tables; and they should cultivate habits of earnest study, of mental activity, especially giving themselves to prayer, and to the diligent study of the Scriptures. \u2014MS.",
