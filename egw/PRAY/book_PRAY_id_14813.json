    "word": "When I awake in the night I begin to pray. Some three weeks ago I awoke and said, \"O God, have mercy on me.\" I had no more than spoken when a voice by me seemed to say, \"I am right by you, I have not left you.\" This was everything to me, and it may be just the same to you. Jesus says, I am right by you, dwelling with you, you are not alone at all. That was just the joy I experienced, and it was worth more than mountains of gold to me. I have learned to trust my Saviour, and I want to tell you that I have a Saviour, and He lives; and because He lives I shall live also.",
