    "word": "We can not overestimate the value of simple faith and unquestioning obedience. It is by following the path of obedience in humble faith that the character attains perfection. Adam was required to render strict obedience to God's commandments, and no lower standard is presented to those who desire salvation today. Christ has promised us sufficient power to reach this high standard. He says: \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it. If ye love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world can not receive.\" [John 14:13-17.]",
