    "word": "We are living in the most solemn period of this world\u2019s history. The destiny of earth\u2019s teeming multitudes is about to be decided. Our own future well-being, and also the salvation of other souls, depend upon the course which we now pursue. We need to \n276\nbe guided by the Spirit of truth. Every follower of Christ should earnestly inquire, \u201cLord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d We need to humble ourselves before the Lord, with fasting and prayer, and to meditate much upon His Word, especially upon the scenes of the judgment. We should now seek a deep and living experience in the things of God. We have not a moment to lose. Events of vital importance are taking place around us; we are on Satan\u2019s enchanted ground.\u2014(The Great Controversy, 601.)",
