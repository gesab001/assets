    "word": "PRAYER GIVES EVIDENCE OF OUR CONFIDENCE IN GOD.\u2014The Lord says, \u201cCall upon Me in the day of trouble.\u201d Psalm 50:15. He invites us to present to Him our perplexities and necessities, and our need of divine help. He bids us be instant in prayer. As soon as difficulties arise, we are to offer to Him our sincere, earnest petitions. By our importunate prayers we give evidence of our strong confidence in God. The sense of our need leads us to pray earnestly, and our heavenly Father is moved by our supplications.\u2014(Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 172.)",
