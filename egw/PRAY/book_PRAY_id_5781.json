    "word": "KEEP ASKING, EVEN IF THE ANSWER DOES NOT COME.\u2014Sometimes answers to our prayers come immediately; sometimes we have to wait patiently and continue earnestly to plead for the things that we need, our cases being illustrated by the case of the importunate solicitor for bread. \u201cWhich of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight,\u201d etc. This lesson means more than we can imagine. We are to keep on asking, even if we do not realize the immediate response to our prayers. \u201cI say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\u201d Luke 11:9, 10.",
