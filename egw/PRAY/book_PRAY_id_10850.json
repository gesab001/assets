    "word": "The Lord uses the human agent. The divine and the human are to unite, becoming laborers together in the work of uplifting and restoring the moral image of God in man. . . . Move intelligently and perseveringly. Do not be discouraged if you do not at first have all the sympathy and cooperation that you expect. If you work, making the Lord your dependence, be assured that the Lord always helps the humble, meek, and lowly. But you need the working of the Holy Spirit upon your own heart and mind, in order to know how to do Christian help work. Pray much for those you are trying to help. Let them see that your dependence is upon a higher power, and you will win souls.-- Letter 24, 1898.",
