    "word": "Christ's Message Rejected \n\n     To those who were unprejudiced, the words of Christ were as the light from heaven. \"Never man spake like this man.\" As the Great Teacher presented the absorbing realities of the eternal future, the things of this perishing world were eclipsed. How eagerly did those who had been praying for light receive the truth. But the proud and self-righteous refused His message.--TSS 35-39.",
