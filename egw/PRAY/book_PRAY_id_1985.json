    "word": "The Church Members to Help.--The Lord requires that far greater personal effort shall be put forth by the members of our churches. Souls have been neglected, towns and villages and cities have not heard the truth for this time, because wise missionary efforts have not been made. . . . Our ordained ministers must do what they can, but it must not be expected that one man can do the work of all. The Master has appointed unto every man his work. There are visits to be made, there is praying to be done, there is sympathy to be imparted; and the piety--the heart and hand--of the whole church is to be employed if the work is to be accomplished. You can sit down with your friends, and in a pleasant, social way, talk of the precious Bible faith.--Review and Herald, Aug. 13, 1889.",
