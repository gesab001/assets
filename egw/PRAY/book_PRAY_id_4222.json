    "word": "Whenever the study of the Scriptures is entered upon without a prayerful, humble, teachable spirit, the plainest and simplest as well as the most difficult passages will be wrested from their true meaning. . . . The Word of God is plain to all who study it with a prayerful heart. Every truly honest soul will come to the light of truth. \"Light is sown for the righteous.\" Psalm 97:11. And no church can advance in holiness unless its members are earnestly seeking for truth as for hid treasure.",
