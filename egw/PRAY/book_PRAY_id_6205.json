    "word": "PARENTS TO PRAY FOR THEIR CHILDREN.\u2014God has promised to give wisdom to those that ask in faith, and He will do just as He said He would. He is pleased with the faith that takes Him at His word. The mother of Augustine prayed for her son\u2019s conversion. She saw no evidence that the Spirit of God was impressing his heart, but she was not discouraged. She laid her finger upon the texts, presenting before God His own words, and pleaded as only a mother can. Her deep humiliation, her earnest importunities, her unwavering faith, prevailed, and the Lord gave her the desire of her heart. Today He is just as ready to listen to the petitions of His people. \u201cHis hand is not shortened that it cannot save, neither His ear heavy that it cannot hear;\u201d and if Christian parents seek Him earnestly, He will fill their mouths with arguments, and, for His name\u2019s sake, will work mightily in their behalf in the conversion of their children.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, 322, 323.)",
