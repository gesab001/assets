    "word": "My soul is burdened for poor, benighted Italy. I weep and pray over the matter, begging for wisdom and the power of God that He will help the laborers here, that the truth shall triumph, and that the work shall move on \n\n\n                                    -273- \n\nagainst the darkness and superstition and error. We cannot appreciate the truth only in contrast with error; with the dark background, false doctrines, and error, the truth shines forth clear and connected, link after link, uniting in a perfect whole; it binds all that is good and true together, and connects them with heaven.--Ms 15a, 1886, pp. 1, 4.
