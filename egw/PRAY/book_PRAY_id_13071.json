    "word": "I have had a special season of prayer. I have most earnestly committed my case to God, and feel a degree of relief. My spirit finds rest in Jesus. There is not one upon earth upon whom I can lean for encouragement or strength. No one, not even my husband, can have an understanding of my mind. He is a stranger to my trials, my temptations, my conflicts and buffetings. His own case occupies his mind, and I ought not to expect that appreciation of my peculiar position my spirit so earnestly craves. I long to lean upon someone, but God \n\n\n                                     -30- \n\nsees perhaps this is not best, and breaks my hold from everyone, that I shall cling to Him alone. I cry unto God for wisdom, grace, and power to control my spirit at all times and offend not in word. My lips shall not sin. I will keep my mouth with a bridle. Wrote my mind to James. Confessed my wrong in speaking and acting sometimes.--Ms 13, 1868. (Diary, February 1, 1868.)",
