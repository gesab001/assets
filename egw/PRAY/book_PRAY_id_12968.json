    "word": "At the very commencement of the conference we had a long meeting of three hours with the ministers alone and the Spirit of the Lord was upon me. Calling each person by name, I laid out the true condition of each one. Especially did I open before Elder C his method of labor. Oh, how he cried, and yet I could see that while he was depreciating himself there was an attempt at justification, as though after all he was not so bad, but I could not allow it. I told them all that I knew their situation. I told how wrong it was to receive pay as ministers and yet neglect the flock, leaving them to perish. I told them the Lord did not accept their labors. Then confessions were made, and prayer was offered together that He would mercifully heal the wounds that they had given to the cause.",
