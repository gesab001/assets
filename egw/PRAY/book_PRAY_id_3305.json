    "word": "There is need of prayer--most earnest, fervent, agonizing prayer--such prayer as David offered when he exclaimed: \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.\" \"I have longed after thy precepts\"; \"I have longed for thy salvation.\" \"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.\" \"My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments\" (Psalm 42:1;  119:40, 174; Psalm 84:2; 119:20). This is the spirit of wrestling prayer, such as was possessed by the royal psalmist. . . .",
