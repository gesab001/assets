    "word": "My brethren, watch unto prayer. The men who have obtained an experience that enables them to labor successfully for the Master, and who are doing good \n62\nwork in their various positions of trust, should not be encouraged to leave their present work for some other line of work. If they should follow the policy that will be advocated by some, leaving the place in which they are now working, to enter the health food work, the cause of the Lord, at the end of the year, would be far behind where it ought to be.",
