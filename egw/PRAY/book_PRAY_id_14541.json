    "word": "No man can serve two masters. If tobacco is your master, if it has brought all your forces under the control of the pernicious appetite, it is your master and you are its slave. How then can you serve your tobacco and your God, sending up the fumes of tobacco before you go into the prayer meeting so that your mind is so confused that you do not know what you are about? Why? Because the stimulant of tobacco and the stimulant of the Holy Spirit of God never combine to give meaning to inspiration in the meeting that you may give the testimony clear from the courts of heaven that God wants you to give.",
