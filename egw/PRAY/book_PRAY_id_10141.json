    "word": "Those who profess to serve God, yet really serve mammon, will be visited with judgments. None will be justified in a course of disobedience for the sake of worldly profit. If God would excuse one man, He might all. Those who disregard the Lord's express injunction for personal advantage, are heaping up for themselves future woe. Christ said: \"Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves\" (Mark 11:17). The people of God should inquire closely if they have not, like the Jews of old, made the house of God a place of merchandise.",
