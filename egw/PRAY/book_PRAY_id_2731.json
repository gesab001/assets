    "word": "Some reason that the Lord will by His Holy Spirit qualify a man to speak as He would have him; but the Lord does not propose to do the work that He has given man to do. He has given us reasoning powers, and opportunities to educate the mind and manners. And after we have done all we can for ourselves, making the best use of the advantages within our reach, then we may look to God with earnest prayer to do by His Spirit that which we cannot do for ourselves.-- \"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. IV, pages 404, 405. \n\n[92]",
