    "word": "There are two kingdoms in this world, the kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of Satan. To one of these kingdoms each one of us belong. In His wonderful prayer for His disciples, Christ said, \"I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through Thy truth; Thy Word is truth. As Thou hast sent Me into the world, even so I have also sent them into the world. \n\n\n                                        Ellen G. White",
