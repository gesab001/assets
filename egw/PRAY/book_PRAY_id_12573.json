    "word": "What is sin? John defines it in these words, \"Whoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.\" Obedience to the law is the standard held up before us. There is no reason why we should be transgressors. We may be Christians in every sense of the word. By constant prayer we are to bring Christ into our lives. From Him we are to receive the grace that will enable us to overcome. Only by receiving this grace can we go on from strength to strength, and gain a fitness for eternal life. We shall have conflicts and temptations to meet, and we are to meet them in the spirit of Christ. The Saviour says, \"My grace is sufficient.\"",
