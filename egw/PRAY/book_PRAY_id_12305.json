    "word": "I labored for a young man who was an infidel. He wanted me to place my hand on his head to see how low his reverence was, and he said it was impossible for him to honor God. I told him that he must. I labored and prayed with him, and at times its seemed like a hopeless case, but the Spirit of the Lord followed this young man until one day while on a steamer going down the Mississippi he yielded his stubborn will and gave his heart to God. It makes no difference about the head; if we only have a willingness, the Lord will assist us in overcoming as He did this young man. This man now stands at the head of the General Conference. Now that the Lord has worked for him, he knows how to work for infidels.",
