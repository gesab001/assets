    "word": "Washington, D. C., Monday, December 22, 1890 \n\n     This day was devoted in the early morning, at half-past four o'clock, to prayer for the Lord to bless me and give me physical strength and mental clearness, and clear spiritual discernment. I believe the promise, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" I shall take the Lord Jesus at His word.",
