    "word": "After we have offered our petitions, we are to answer them ourselves as far as possible, and not wait for God to do for us what we can do for ourselves.

But we cannot reach the battlements of heaven without climbing for ourselves. We cannot be borne up by the prayers of others when we ourselves neglect to pray; for God has made no such provision for us. . . . The unlovely traits in our characters are not removed, and replaced by traits that are pure and lovely, without some effort on our part. . . .",
