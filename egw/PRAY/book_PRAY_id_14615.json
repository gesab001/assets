    "word": "Now, if you will open your hearts to the truth, then your understanding will be clear and you can present the truth to others. But if there are doubts and unbelief entertained, Christ cannot bring His light and the glory of His presence into your souls. Cannot you now begin to cultivate faith and talk of the mercies of God, and praise God with all your hearts? It is by prayer that you will receive strength to resist temptation. Christ will supply your wants, and relieve your doubts, and fill your soul with gladness.",
