    "word": "We feel so distressed over the situation of our Sanitarium; we cannot see where the means is coming from to erect the building. The building now being used casts discredit upon us as a people. It was a dwelling house, and the bathrooms which should be large and convenient, are composed of a sleeping room partitioned off, one part of which is used for the ladies and the other for the gentlemen. The persons on one side of the partition can hear all that is going on in the next apartment. This cannot leave a \n\n\n                                   -128- \n\nfavorable impression on the minds of the patients. We are praying that the Lord will send us means, and we believe that means will come. The Lord will help us in this work. The medical missionary work is to bring the truth before many others, and the Lord will open the way before us. The building they now occupy is full to overflowing and rooms have to be secured in another building.",
