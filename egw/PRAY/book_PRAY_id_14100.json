    "word": "In the mountains, Colorado, Thursday, September 18, 1873. We have another beautiful day. Cold nights and mornings, warm in the middle of the day. We expect Brother Glover or Mr. Walling or both today. We have had a good season of prayer in the woods, my husband and I. Two travelers and one horse returning from the Park came by our camp. We gave them bread as they said they had nothing to eat but squirrels and pork. They brought some fine specimens and curiosities from Willow Creek.",
