    "word": "June 20, 1892. I slept the first part of the night, but during the latter part I could not rest. I committed my case to the Lord, and was comforted by the thought that I am a subject of His care. I do find peace and comfort in prayer, but I should look upon it as a great blessing from the Lord if I could pass the hours of the night in sleep. These words comfort and strengthen me: \"Be renewed in the spirit of your mind.\" This renewing is what I desire to have. \"Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.\" The righteousness of Christ is the prize to which we are individually to reach forth. \"Let this mind be in you,\" Paul writes, \"which was also in Christ Jesus.\" We must walk as He walked and work as He worked. This means constant self-denial and a daily reaching out to do others good. We lose much because we are so apt to forget the fulness of the grace provided for us through the merits of Christ. No one is safe who offers the Lord a dull, sleepy, indifferent service. In order to resist the temptations of the enemy, we shall have to wrestle in earnest prayer with God. By using the grace bestowed, we shall gain a vigorous Christianity.",
