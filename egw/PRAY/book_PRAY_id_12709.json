    "word": "He [James White] does not suffer bodily pain but his great trouble is battling with depression of spirits. He seems to feel that he has wronged me very much. He goes back to the letters he wrote me when he was in California, and you and I attended the camp meetings. He feels that he has committed a great sin that the Lord can hardly forgive. My work is to comfort him and to pray for him; to speak cheerful, loving words to him and soothe him.--Letter 13, 1877, p. 1. (To W. C. and Mary White, September 3, 1877.)",
