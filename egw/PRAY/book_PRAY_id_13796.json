    "word": "Brother Whitney has just come into our room and he says the two young men have come again to talk with them. He talked and prayed with them. One has investigated so that he sees now that he must lift the cross. He says he does not hesitate because he will be laughed at or reproached, but he feels keenly at the thought of disappointing his parents who expect him to be educated for a minister. He says he has stated to the principal his convictions and he tells him that if he does keep the Sabbath he must leave the college. Ministers have labored with them, then they bring the arguments to our brethren in the office, \n\n\n                                    -326- \n\nand they show them the difference between the teachings of the Bible and the sayings of men. The one who is convinced says he will write an essay on the Sabbath question and read it in his class. There seems to be quite a stir in the college just now. Oh, that God would move upon hearts, convict and convert souls.",
