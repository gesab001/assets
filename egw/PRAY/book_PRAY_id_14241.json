    "word": "When you are tempted to speak rashly, remember that harsh, hasty words will dishonor your divine Companion. The Lord Jesus asked you to \n\n\n                                     -137- \n\nput your trust in Him. It is the privilege of all, ministers and people, to put their trust in the Saviour. Let your conversation be heavenly. Reveal by your words that Christ is abiding in the soul. When tempted to speak words that will grieve the Holy Spirit, lift the heart to God in prayer. He will help you to speak right words. Hope thou in God. Be a humble, trusting child of faith. I know that the Lord will not forsake you if you will put your trust in Him.",
