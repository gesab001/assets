    "word": "Christ is as hungry for fruit from ministers and people as when, on His way from Bethany to Jerusalem, He came to a fig tree covered with foliage and presenting an appearance of fruitfulness. But upon searching its branches, from the lowest bough to the topmost twig, Jesus found \"nothing but leaves.\" It was a mass of pretentious foliage, nothing more. Today Christ comes to His people, hungering to find in them the fruits of righteousness. But many, many have \n\n\n                                  -200- \n\nnothing but leaves to offer Him. They have left their first love, and upon them has fallen spiritual blindness, hardness of heart, stubbornness of mind. They pray to God and present Bible truth to the people, for they are in the habit of doing so; but they have lost that which would make their service acceptable.",
