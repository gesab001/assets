    "word": "WE INSULT GOD BY CLAIMING THE PROMISE WITHOUT MEETING THE CONDITIONS.\u2014There are conditions to the fulfillment of God\u2019s promises, and prayer can never take the place of duty. \u201cIf ye love Me,\u201d Christ says, \u201cKeep My commandments.\u201d\u201cHe that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, \n105\nand will manifest Myself to him.\u201d John 14:15, 21. Those who bring their petitions to God, claiming His promise while they do not comply with the conditions, insult Jehovah. They bring the name of Christ as their authority for the fulfillment of the promise, but they do not those things that would show faith in Christ and love for Him.\u2014(Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 143.)",
