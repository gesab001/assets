    "word": "The history of Daniel and his fellows is an illustration of what all youth may become in the service of God. Improve the opportunity that is now yours to obtain the very best idea of what constitutes a Christian character. Place yourselves where you can pray to God as Daniel and his fellows prayed to Him. They presented themselves to God as needy and dependant, and God gave them strength. But do you think that Daniel would have been helped as he was if he had yielded to appetite? Had he eaten the king's food and drunk his wine, he would have been unable to obtain the education necessary to make him a successful Christian statesman. He would not have appreciated the knowledge God had to give, His mind would have been confused. He knew this, for before he came to Babylon he had received that training which every child before me should receive in the home.--Ms 65, 1901, p. 4. (Sermon, typed July 28, 1901.)",
