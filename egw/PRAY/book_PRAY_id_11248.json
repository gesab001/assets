    "word": "When this is your experience, no words of censure or blame will fall from your lips for those who are your fellow-workers, because you are being taught of God, and are learning to speak the words of Christ. Your earnest prayers for pardon for your own defects, and for the blessing of God upon your efforts, will show that your lips have been converted. And this will touch the cold hearts of unbelievers. They will distinguish between the human and the divine.",
