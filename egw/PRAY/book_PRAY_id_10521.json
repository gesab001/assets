    "word": "The apostle made his way at once to the house where his brethren were assembled, and where they were at that moment engaged in earnest prayer for him. \u201cAs Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. And they said\n234\nunto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.\u201d\u2014AA 147, 148.",
