    "word": "To all who would mark out a certain definite course for their brother to pursue, the Lord says, Stand out of the way. Satan and his emissaries are doing enough of this kind of work.

And whenever it is impossible for them to gather for counsel, God will instruct through His Spirit those who sincerely desire to serve Him.--Letter 32a, 1908. \n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. April 13, 1989. Entire Letter.",
