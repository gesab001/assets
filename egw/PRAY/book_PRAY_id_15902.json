    "word": "The subject that has been placed before me for counsel is one to be carefully considered. Our sisters whose minds are agitated upon the subject of again resuming the reform dress should go prayerfully cautious in every move they make. We have now the most solemn, important test given to us from the Word of God for this special period of time. His test is for the whole world. The Lord does not require that any tests of human invention shall be brought in to divert the minds of the people or create controversy in some line. It may be that some are thirsting for distinction in some way. If they are thirsting for a battle with satanic agencies, let them be sure that they first have on every piece of the armor of God. If they have not, they will surely be worsted, and make for themselves grievous trials and disappointments which they are not prepared to meet. Let all seek the Lord most earnestly for the deep and rich experience that is to be found in the subject of heart preparedness to follow Christ where he will lead the way. \"If any man will come after me,\" he says, \"let him deny himself and take up his cross, and follow me.\" These words are to be weighed well. The man who wishes to follow Christ, who chooses to walk in his footsteps, shall find self-denial and the cross in that path. All who follow Christ will understand what this involves.",
