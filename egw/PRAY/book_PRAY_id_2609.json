    "word": "My brethren, there should be a different kind of labor from what we too often see in our camp-meetings. There should be more prayer and weeping, and more confession of sin to God and to one another. Let the indifference be broken up, let the complaining and faultfinding cease, and the time heretofore worse than wasted in this manner be spent in prayers of living faith for the refreshing from the presence of the Lord. Let us arouse as one man, \n225\nand unitedly call upon God to send down his grace upon the souls of his people, and to revive his work in the midst of the years.",
