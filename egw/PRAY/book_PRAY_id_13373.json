    "word": "My brother and sister, you have developed a character which is an offense to God. You have put Jesus away from you in the person of His saint. That which you have done to your mother is registered in heaven as done unto Christ. Your cases have been presented to me. When Brother _____ adopts a certain course of action, he is very firm and will not be moved from his position. He has been prospered financially, and is in great danger of making shipwreck of faith. Brother _____ has not treated his wife in all respects as a Christian husband should, and Sister _____ has not acted like a Christian either, for she has tried to drive her husband to \n\n\n                                   -87- \n\ndo certain things which she thought he ought to do, and she has failed. Both of you have a form of religion, but your prayers do not come up as fragrance before God, and you do not obtain answers in peace and mercy.",
