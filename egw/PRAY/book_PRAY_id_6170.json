    "word": "TRUST GOD WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF PRAYER.\u2014When we have prayed for the recovery of the sick, whatever the outcome of the case, let us not lose faith in God. If we are called upon to meet bereavement, let us accept the bitter cup, remembering that a Father\u2019s hand holds it to our lips. But should health be restored, it should not be forgotten that the recipient of healing mercy is placed under renewed obligation to the Creator.\u2014(Ministry of Healing, 233.)",
