    "word": "I requested those who desired prayers to come forward. The\n244\nseats were quickly filled, and my heart was stirred as I saw the whole congregation on their feet. I said, Sit down just where you are, and we will all seek the Lord together. Before the season of prayer, many testimonies were given in quick succession and with deep feeling, showing that hearts were touched by the Spirit of the Lord. Confessions were made with tears. We were glad to see this work going forward; for we knew it was just such a work as was needed to bring the people into that position of humbling their hearts and confessing their sins before God, that He would accept their repentance and their efforts to seek Him. \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\"--RH, Apr. 19, 1887.",
