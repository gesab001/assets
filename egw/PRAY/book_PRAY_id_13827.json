    "word": "By the expression \"vain repetitions\" the Saviour meant words without meaning, words oft repeated without corresponding thought or proper \n\n\n                                 -102- \n\nunderstanding, words spoken without true and earnest desire. God is not pleased with a careless, unmeaning repetition of many words. This is what makes many prayers long and tiresome. Short, heartfelt prayers, right to the point, offered with an earnestness corresponding to the soul-hunger for the Holy Spirit, are not wearisome to God or to the people; for they reveal a longing desire for needed strength--strength which can be obtained only from the Source of all strength. An effectual, fervent prayer avails much to the one who seeks God for the wisdom that is promised to those who ask in faith. Our heavenly Father is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him than earthly parents are to give bread to their hungry children.",
