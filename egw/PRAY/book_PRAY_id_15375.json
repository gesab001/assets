    "word": "IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO ME BY ELDER DANIELLS, HE SAID: \"I MAY SAY THAT SOME MONTHS AGO IT BECAME VERY APPARENT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD THAT WE OUGHT TO SECURE A MAN OF EXPERIENCE AND LOYALTY TO HEAD OUR WASHINGTON SANITARIUM. AS WE STUDIED AND PRAYED OVER THE MATTER WE WERE CONTINUALLY IMPRESSED THAT IF YOU COULD BE SPARED FROM AUSTRALIA YOU WOULD BE THE MAN TO TAKE THE PLACE. AT LAST THE BOARD PASSED A RESOLUTION REQUESTING ME TO PLACE THE MATTER FULLY BEFORE SISTER WHITE. I DID SO, WITH THE RESULT THAT SHE ADVISED US TO CALL YOU TO THIS POSITION.\" I HAD JUST RECEIVED THEIR LETTER WHEN YOUR COMMUNICATION CAME. AS SOON AS THESE WERE RECEIVED, ELDER EVANS, THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF WASHINGTON SANITARIUM BOARD, CALLED THE MEMBERS TOGETHER, AND IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY VOTED THAT YOU SHOULD BE CHOSEN SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WASHINGTON SANITARIUM, THAT WE SHOULD SEND YOU A CABLE REQUESTING YOU TO COME IMMEDIATELY.\"",
