    "word": "Soon I began to feel distressed and burdened. It seemed that I should be driven to distraction. I found relief by weeping. When in my distress James was afraid I would die, and he threw the letter in the stove as he told me afterwards, then knelt down by my bedside and prayed God to roll off the burden, and I was relieved. The next morning I awoke perfectly free and clear, all my distress was gone and I felt assured God would open the way before us.",
