    "word": "After our visit to Brother L's family, we rode across the field, by a short cut, to reach the house of a brother who is just taking his stand upon \n\n\n                                     -82- \n\nthe truth. His wife is a Sabbathkeeper, an excellent Christian woman, and now if she has her husband with her, what a blessing they can be in letting their light shine forth to their neighbors. This brother (I think I may call him thus) has a large orchard of orange, lemon, and other fruit trees. The orange trees are twenty-five years old, and are loaded with fruit. He will not take it to the market until summer, which is winter in America. We had a timely visit with this family. After a season of prayer I conversed with them, showing that the only way we can grow into assurance and solidity of faith is to become interested in our neighbors, and be a living, shining light in the world. Thus we reveal to others the fruit of the truth in our own lives. We had a precious interview. I felt called out to urge them to be doers of the Word. We did not reach home until after dark, but were glad that we had made the visit.--Letter 28, 1894, pp. 2-6. (To S. N. Haskell, May 9, 1894.)",
