    "word": "Solemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of the atonement. Momentous are the interests involved therein. The Judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. For more than forty years this work has been in progress. Soon\u2014none know how soon\u2014it will pass to the cases of the living. In the awful presence of God our lives are to come up in review. At this time above all others it behooves every soul to heed the Saviour's admonition, \u201cWatch and pray; for ye know not when the time is.\u201d [Mark 13:33.] \u201cIf therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\u201d [Revelation 3:3.]",
