    "word": "The building erected at Avondale for a health retreat is small, about fifteen rooms in all, but it will serve for the present necessity. For this building we solicit your donations. Those who help us in this will be doing \n\n\n                                   -124- \n\na good work. We are much in need of money to provide facilities for work. May the Lord help His people to do the work that is so urgent in this part of His great vineyard. There are important fields to be worked. We shall not hover over the churches but press into new territory and raise the standard in places where the message has not been proclaimed. May the Lord bless and guide you, is my prayer.--Letter 139, 1899. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. June 4, 1987. Entire Letter.",
