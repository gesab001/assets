    "word": "Says Paul, \"Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things\" (Philippians 4:8). This will require earnest prayer and unceasing watchfulness. We must be aided by the abiding influence of the Holy Spirit, which will attract the mind upward, and habituate it to dwell on pure and holy things. And we must give diligent study to the Word of God. \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto according to Thy Word.\" \"Thy Word,\" says the psalmist, \"have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against Thee\" (Psalm 119:9, 11).--PP 460 (1890).",
