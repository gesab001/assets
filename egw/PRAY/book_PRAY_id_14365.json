    "word": "I must do my work and not look for my brethren to do it for me. I have expected too much of my brethren. I must look to God, the Captain of my salvation, and obey His orders. I make no complaint of my brethren. You say you have done your best. I receive your testimony, and I do censure myself that I have let things rest as I have done. I do condemn myself, but I will seek, in the fear of God, henceforth to take up my appointed work, and let nothing interfere between God and my duty. I will now try to set this matter before the people. I will now, if God will help me, do my work to the best of my ability. I look at myself and consider my days are few now, but while life lasts will be faithful to my trust. May the Lord help and bless you, is my prayer.--Letter 25a, 1889. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nMay 9, 1991. Entire Letter.",
