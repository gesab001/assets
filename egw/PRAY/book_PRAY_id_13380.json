He was present on the last day of the camp meeting and heard me speak on Sunday afternoon, and many said he was deeply impressed. He was also much impressed by the evening discourse. After the meeting he went home and talked with his wife to a late hour. He said, I must acknowledge that this people have the truth. He felt deeply. The next morning he was found dead in his bed.
