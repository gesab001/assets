    "word": "My love to your dear children. Tell them for me to have their lives hid with Christ in God, to have their hearts wholly given to God, that they may be hid in the day of the Lord's anger. Pray for us, and do write us and let us know how you get along. I am in haste or I would write more. Babe is cutting teeth, and it takes nearly all of my time to take care of him just now.",
