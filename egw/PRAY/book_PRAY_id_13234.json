    "word": "I do not want you to have any wrong upon your soul. I want you to come off more than conqueror. God wants you to stand on the high platform of eternal rectitude. Let not your good be evil spoken of. You have a living Saviour. Cling fast to Him. Pray, Oh, pray that the Lord will reveal Himself to you, and will maintain you ever to work for Him. You must often feel the necessity of dying to self. Then you will not yield to [any] influence but the influence of the Lord Jesus Christ.",
