    "word": "Never should familiarity with suffering make the physician careless or unsympathetic. When the crisis is over and success is apparent, spend a few moments in prayer with the patient be he believer or unbeliever. Give expression to your thankfulness for the life that has been spared. The physician who follows such a course as this carries his patient to the One upon whom he is dependent for life.",
