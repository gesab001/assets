    "word": "When under test young men show that they have a genuine burden for souls, and intense longing to save their fellow men, they will see souls converted. From their work a harvest for the Lord will be reaped. Let them go out as true missionaries to do the work of circulating books containing present truth. As they go, let their prayers ascend to God for increased light and for the guidance of His Spirit, that they may know how to speak a word in season. When they see an opportunity to do an act of kindness, let them take hold as if they were working for wages. Let them remember that thus they are doing errands for the Lord.--Manuscript 75, 1900.",
