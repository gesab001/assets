We are not to be educated to work after a worldly policy, neither are we to educate others after this line of working. At every step we are to exercise faith, to be much in prayer, to feel dependence upon God, and manifest devotion to his work. Working after this order will bring large blessings in return; but dependence upon men, who make manifest that they are not in vital connection with God, but are moved by their own feelings, will end in placing us under another leader than Jesus Christ. The reasoning in which they indulge is not according to truth and equity.",
