    "word": "Enoch, separating himself from the world, and spending much of his time in prayer and in communion with God, represents God's loyal people in the last days, who will be separate from the world. Unrighteousness will prevail to a dreadful extent upon the earth. Men will give themselves up to follow every\n61\nimagination of their corrupt hearts and carry out their deceptive philosophy and rebel against the authority of high heaven.",
