    "word": "Teach  Your Children to Pray.--My brethren and sisters, I urge you to bring up your children in simplicity. Don't scold them when they do wrong, but take them to the Lord, and tell Him all about it. When you kneel before God with your children, Christ is by your side, and angels of God are all around you. Teach them to ask God to forgive them for being cross and impatient. Bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Let us be men and women of prayer. Let us take hold of the divine nature, and escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. Then we shall have the eternal life insurance policy, a life that measures with the life of God. Then when the ransomed are redeemed from the earth, the city of God will be opened to you, and you can present yourselves before the Lord, saying, Here am I and the children whom Thou hast given me. Then the harp will be placed in your hand, and your voice will be raised in songs of praise to God, and to the Lamb, by whose great sacrifice you are made partakers of His nature, and given an immortal inheritance in the kingdom of God.--RH, Jan. 14, 1909.",
