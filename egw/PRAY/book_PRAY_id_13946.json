    "word": "Much prayer and work in Christ's lines will cure the evils in the church. All dissension must be laid at the foot of the cross of Calvary. A clear, unobstructed view of Jesus will heal the existing difficulties. The heart will be softened and subdued as we look upon the wonderful sacrifice God has made in giving His only begotten Son to die for us. The heart will break with emotion as we think of what it has cost heaven to place the sinful race upon probation.",
