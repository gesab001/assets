    "word": "There was every provision made by his satanic majesty to make the most of the opportunities given him to lead all who would be led into temptation, that he could make his suggestions to many minds, that the light sent from heaven was only fanaticism, excitement, because the after influence was not of that character to reveal the best fruits. Satan will instill into minds his specious reasonings because the ones blessed did not cherish and appreciate the divine enlightenment, and their hearts were not filled with awe and love that God had blessed and sanctified them through the truth. Instead of using their God-given powers to devise means that they could accomplish good and communicate that which they had received worshiping God in Spirit and in truth, they ate and drank and rose up to play. \n                                                                           1212\nThey perverted and misapplied the rich grace of God, and bowed their soul's powers to worship an idol just as Satan laid his plans they should do through resuming their amusements in games and plays which led away from watchfulness and prayer.",
