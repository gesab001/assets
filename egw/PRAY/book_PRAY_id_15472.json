    "word": "Every soul has the privilege of stating to the Lord his own special necessities, and to offer his individual thanksgiving for the blessings that he daily receives. But the many long and spiritless, faithless prayers that are offered to God, instead of being a joy to Him, are a burden. We need, O so much! (494) clean, converted hearts. We need to have our faith strengthened. \"Ask, and ye shall receive,\" the Saviour \n\n\n                            -280- \n\npromised; \"Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" We need to educate ourselves to trust in this Word, and to bring the light and grace of Christ unto all our works. We need to take hold of Christ, and to retain our hold of Him until we know that the power of His transforming grace is manifested in us. We must have faith in Christ if we would reflect the divine character.",
