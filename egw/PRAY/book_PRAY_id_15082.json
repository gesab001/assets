    "word": "In our season of prayer at the commencement of the Sabbath I was drawn out in earnest supplication to God that Jesus, the Great Physician, would restore me to soundness and give me victory over my present exhaustion that I could speak to the people. I could not give up the point. I must have help; I must have the divine touch, and strength would then be given me and my feebleness be removed and life-giving power be imparted. The Lord heard [my] prayer. I believe in His name. I claim His promises, Ask and ye shall receive. \"Whatsoever ye ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.\" John 14:13. I had all the assurance I wanted. God's Word, that is yea and amen.",
