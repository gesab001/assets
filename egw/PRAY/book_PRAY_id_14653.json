    "word": "I wish to say to everyone here today, You can be a laborer together with God. As you seek to help and bless those who come to the school, you stand under the protection of God. But those who exert an influence which encourages disobedience and vice stand under the displeasure of God. He knows all about their course, and He will arrange matters so that they will not stay long at the school unless they are converted. But we very much desire that they shall be converted. We want this school to be a place where God can abide in answer to our prayers.",
