    "word": "I was much pleased, Brother Palmer, to hear that water had been found on the sanitarium land. I have always had a very strong impression that water could be found there. When I saw the place, I said, If I ever have a chance, the matter shall be tested and proved, even if water has to be sought for in several places. I thank the Lord that He does reward persevering effort. Then pray, and believe that there is something for each one to do.",
