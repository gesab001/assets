    "word": "God has a special work for the men of experience to do. They are to guard the cause of God. [NOTICE HOW FULLY THE GENERAL INTERESTS OF THE CAUSE ARE SAFEGUARDED IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW. NOTICE, ALSO, THAT UPON THE MEN IN RESPONSIBILITY IS PLACED THE BURDEN OF LEADERSHIP AND HELPFUL GUIDANCE.] They are to see that the work of God is not committed to men who feel it their privilege to move out on their own independent judgment, to preach whatever they please, and to be responsible to no one for their instructions or work. Let this spirit of self-sufficiency once rule in our midst, and there will be no harmony of action, no unity of spirit, no safety \n                                                                           25\nfor the work, and no healthful growth in the cause. There will be false teachers, evil workers, who will, by insinuating error, draw away souls from the truth. Christ prayed that His followers might be one as He and the Father were one. Those who desire to see this prayer answered, should seek to discourage the slightest tendency to division, and try to keep the spirit of unity and love among brethren.",
