    "word": "MR No. 171 - Further Materials for the Book \"I'd Like to Ask Sister White\"\n\n     The brethren think we ought to have a little house put up. We pay now $1.50 per week for rent, and have scarcely any conveniences at that. Have to go a great distance for water; have no good shed for our wood. We put a few boards up at our own expense just to cover our wood. We shall make a beginning; cannot tell how we shall succeed. May the Lord guide us in all our undertakings is my prayer.--Letter 9, 1856, p. 3. (To Sister [E. P.] Below, January 1, 1856.)",
