    "word": "We want you to love secret prayer. Just as long as you watch and pray you will retain the victory, but when you love play better than you love to read the precious Word of God and better than you love the hour of prayer, you manifest that your love for holy things is small. If we overcome our wrong and sinful habits we must work. Make strong efforts, for Satan will do all in his power to overcome every one who is seeking to love and serve Jesus.",
