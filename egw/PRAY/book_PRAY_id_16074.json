We are to become one with Christ, in harmony with his prayer: \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all shall be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that \n\n\n                               -463- \n\nthe world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou has loved me. . . . . O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them.\"",
