    "word": "My dear sister, we will pray for you. You have our sympathy. We shall present your case to the Great Physician. I understand that this has already been done. Hold fast to the hand of Him who can bless and heal if He sees that it is for your present and eternal good. And now, my brother and sister, while you are both alive, take this precious time to appropriate by faith to yourselves the precious promises of the Word of God. I am thankful that you are both presenting yourselves as humble seekers for the pardon of all sin. This is your privilege. Do not disbelieve.",
