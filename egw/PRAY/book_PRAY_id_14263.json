    "word": "Love for souls that Christ had will lead the minister to pray most earnestly for divine grace; will lead to importunate prayer. There is altogether too much sermonizing and too little ministering. We must work in wisdom; work with hearts imbued with the love of Jesus. Men without one particle of grace may preach a discourse, but men without grace will not be inclined to weep and to pray and seek to lead souls to the Lamb of God. It is this kind of labor the people need.",
