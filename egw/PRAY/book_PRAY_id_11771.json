    "word": "I have an earnest desire, my dear Brother Butler, that you shall just now stand in your lot and place in Nashville. The Lord is setting things in order there, and you are needed. May God help you and strengthen you, is my prayer. I pray constantly for you. Be of good courage in the Lord. Let nothing separate you from the work at Nashville. Be as true as steel to principle. The enemy will try to discourage and annoy you, but remember that the Lord is upholding you. He will be the light of your countenance, and your God.",
