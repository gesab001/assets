    "word": "Paul's labors at Antioch, in association with Barnabas, strengthened him in his conviction that the Lord had called him to do a special work for the Gentile world. At the time of Paul's conversion, the Lord had declared that he was to be made a minister to the\n230\nGentiles, \u201cto open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive the forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Me.\u201d Acts 26:18. The angel that appeared to Ananias, had said of Paul, \u201cHe is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.\u201d Acts 9:15. And Paul himself, later in his Christian experience, while praying in the temple at Jerusalem, had been visited by an angel from heaven, who bade him, \u201cDepart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.\u201d Acts 22:21.\u2014AA 159.",
