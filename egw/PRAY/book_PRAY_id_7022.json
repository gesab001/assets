    "word": "The people of God are not to be guided by the opinions or practices of the world. Hear what the Saviour said to His disciples, \"I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you\" (John 14:16, 17). \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not\" (1 John 3:1).",
