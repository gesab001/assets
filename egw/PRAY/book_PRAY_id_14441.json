    "word": "South Lancaster, Monday, October 20, 1890 \n\n     I have risen at three o'clock a.m. I am not feeling well this morning. Was suffering much pain in my left ear from seven o'clock until ten. Then obtained rest in sleep. Praise the Lord for the restorer, Sleep. What a blessing it is! The malaria seizes me whenever it can have a chance and I have a continual warfare to keep from being incapacitated for labor on this account; and I do pray that this afflicted ear may recover and I shall not lose my hearing.",
