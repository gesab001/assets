    "word": "While we were in Switzerland I had many letters from a sister whom I dearly love and highly esteem. In every one of these letters were the most gloomy pictures. She seemed to be dwelling on everything objectionable. Soon after I received these letters I prayed the Lord that He would give her help to turn her mind from the channel that it was running in. That night I had a dream presented to me three times. I was walking in a beautiful garden, and Sister Martha ----- was by my side. As soon as she came into the garden I said, \"Martha, do you not see this beautiful garden? See, here are the lilies, the roses, and the pinks.\" \"Yes,\" she said, as she looked up and smiled. Soon I looked to see where she was. I was looking at the lilies, the roses, and the pinks, and did not see her. She was in another part of the garden, and was grasping a thistle. Then she was pricking her hands on the bramblebushes. She said they hurt her hands, and she asked, \"Why do they keep all these thistles and these briers in the garden? Why do they let them stay here?\"",
