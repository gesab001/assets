    "word": "Those who profess to believe the special truths for this time need to be converted, and sanctified by the truth. As Christians we are made depositaries of sacred truth, and we are not to keep the truth in the outer court, but bring it into the sanctuary of the soul. Then the church will possess divine vitality throughout. The weak shall be as David, and David as the angel of the Lord. One question will be all-absorbing,--Who shall approach nearest the likeness of Christ? Who shall do the most to win souls to righteousness? When this is the ambition of believers, contention is at an end; the prayer of Christ is answered. . . . .",
