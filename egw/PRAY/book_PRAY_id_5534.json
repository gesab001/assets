    "word": "As yet the disciples were unacquainted with the Saviour\u2019s unlimited resources and power. He said to them, \u201cHitherto have ye asked nothing in My name.\u201d John 16:24. He explained that the secret of their success would be in asking for strength and grace in His name. He would be present before the Father to make request for them. The prayer of the humble suppliant He presents as His own desire in that soul\u2019s behalf. Every sincere prayer is heard in heaven. It may not be fluently expressed; but if the heart is in it, it will ascend to the sanctuary where Jesus ministers, and He will present it to the Father without one awkward, stammering word, beautiful and fragrant with the incense of His own perfection.",
