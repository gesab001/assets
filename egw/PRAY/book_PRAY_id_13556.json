    "word": "When brethren come together in harmony with the directions of Christ, Jesus Himself is a witness to the scene, and the whole universe looks with intense interest upon those who not only believe but do the words of Christ. The Spirit of God will move upon the heart of him who has erred, when Christ's words are carried out, and the one at fault will be convicted of his error. But if he is too proud, too self-sufficient, to confess his mistake and heal the wrong, other steps are to be taken in order to follow out the complete directions of the Word. \"But if he will not hear thee (in that private interview), then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established\" (Matthew 18:16). The matter of difficulty is to be confined to as small a number as possible. But two or three are to labor with the one who is in error. They should not only talk with him but bow in prayer, and with humble hearts seek the Lord.",
