    "word": "The Lord wants wise men and women, acting in the capacity of nurses, to comfort and help the sick and suffering. Through the ministrations of these nurses, \n\n\n                              -76- \n\nthose who have heretofore taken no interest in religious things will be led to ask, \"What must I do to be saved?\" The sick will be led to Christ by the patient attention of nurses who anticipate their wants, and who bow in prayer and ask the great Medical Missionary to look with compassion upon the sufferer, and to let the soothing influence of His grace be felt and His restoring power be exercised. (21) (page 121 begins) O that all who are sick and afflicted could be ministered to by Christ-like physicians and nurses, who could help them to place their weary, pain-racked bodies in the care of the great Healer, in faith looking to Him for restoration.",
