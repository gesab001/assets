    "word": "August 11, 1885. (en route to Europe.) The sea is boisterous. . . . The waves rise high in green and blue and white spray, mingled, and dash with force against the porthole. If the porthole were open buckets full of water would dash in upon us. . . . The boat rocks fearfully and every timber seems to be strained and shocked. There are but few upon deck. The deck is wet. \n\n\n                                    -180- \n\nChairs are tied with ropes. Ropes are stretched from point to point that those who walk on deck may take hold of the ropes to keep from falling. There is indeed a heavy roll. I cannot lie on the sofa. Trunks are rolling about in the staterooms. . . . Everything that is not secured by ropes is dancing about. . . . I have precious seasons of silent prayer. The Lord Jesus seems very near to me. I am so thankful that I can trust in my Saviour at all times.",
