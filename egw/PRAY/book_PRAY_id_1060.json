    "word": "My brethren and sisters, plead for the Holy Spirit, God stands back of every promise He has made. With your Bibles in your hands, say: \"I have done as Thou hast said, I present Thy promise, 'Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.'\" Christ declares: \"What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\" \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.\" Matthew 7:7; Mark 11:24; John 14:13.",
