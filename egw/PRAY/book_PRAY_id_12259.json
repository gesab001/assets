    "word": "Sands, Va., Monday, Nov. 10, 1890. I slept this morning unusually long. It was five o'clock before I left my bed. After a season of prayer, I wrote important matters to which my mind was called in a dream. I know it was a message for this people. I read the same in the early morning meeting. The meetings were good. I urged upon all present to arouse to their God-given responsibilities at home and abroad. The Lord Jesus has given in His teachings important lessons on faith and love and the comparative claims of heaven and earth. The Lord Jesus, the world's Redeemer, understands the human heart. He understands the dangers and perils of Satan's temptations to make the world all absorbing. There is our danger. If these temptations prevail, the love of God is expelled from the soul and the love of the world fills the vacuum. No earthly power can change this order of things. The love of God brought back to the human heart the power of God. Working with man's human effort, this power can dislodge the love of the world by keeping a better world in view.",
