    "word": "MR No. 540 - Ellen White and Her Son Edson\n\n     Last night I visited Edson. Went to his house at seven and there remained until half past nine o'clock. I talked with him plainly but kindly, but his feelings were very strong that he had been misused. No mercy had been shown him when he left the office, although he had acknowledged his wrong. I saw that he was making no headway and we bowed in prayer.",
