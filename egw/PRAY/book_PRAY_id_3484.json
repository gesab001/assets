    "word": "Christians have many sources of happiness at their command, and they may tell with unerring accuracy what pleasures are lawful and right. They may enjoy such recreations as will not dissipate the mind or debase the soul, such as will not disappoint and leave a sad after-influence to destroy self-respect or bar the way to usefulness. \n                                                                           86\nIf they can take Jesus with them and maintain a prayerful spirit they are perfectly safe.--MYP 38 (1884).",
