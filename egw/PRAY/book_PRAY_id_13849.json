    "word": "There are those who present to the people of God fables and suppositions which they declare they must accept or perish in their sins. Let God's people pray to Him for clear spiritual discernment, that they may distinguish the theories of men from the Word of the living God. Let them study the Scriptures. Why do they not, with Bible in hand and on bended knee, ask for the presence of the Holy Spirit, that they may have wisdom and understanding? Precious will be the experience thus gained.",
