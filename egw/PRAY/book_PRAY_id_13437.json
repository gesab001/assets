    "word": "Self-restraint is essential to be exercised by every Christian if they answer the prayer of Christ. He is not a good soldier who will not submit his own judgment and his own ideas to preserve unity of action. We have a noble Captain and every soldier must obey orders. The meekness and lowliness of Christ always leads to unity and hence to strength in united action.--Letter 62, 1886, pp. 3-6. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 16, 1984",
