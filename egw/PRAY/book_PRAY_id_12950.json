    "word": "MR No. 618 - Our Responsibility to Glorify God\n\n     You can glorify God only by bearing fruit to His glory. Ministers, for Christ's sake begin the work for yourselves. By your unsanctified lives you have laid stumbling-blocks before your own children and before unbelievers. Some of you move by impulse, act from passion and prejudice, and bring impure, tainted offerings to God. For Christ's sake cleanse the camp by beginning the personal work of purifying the soul, through the grace of Christ, from moral defilement. A jovial minister in the pulpit, or one who is stretching beyond his measure to win praise, is a spectacle that crucifies the Son of God afresh, and puts Him to open shame. There must be thorough repentance, faith in our Saviour Jesus Christ, vigilant watchfulness, unceasing prayer, and diligent searching of the Scriptures.",
