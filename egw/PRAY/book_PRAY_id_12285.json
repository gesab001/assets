    "word": "Last Thursday morning we rode eighteen miles to Athens. We found the people needed help very much. I spoke Sunday morning, then we had a meeting with the church especially, then a praying season with the family we had tarried with. . . . We started at five o'clock for Norridgwock. Brother Ira Rodgers had taken us in a wagon. He exchanged that for a sleigh, as the night before we had a fall of snow--about two or three inches. It was extremely cold, and a sleigh was preferable to a wagon. We came wrapped up with all the clothing we had. We came thirteen miles in one hour and a half. It seemed sometimes as though we almost flew over the ground. But it was intensely cold and we came near freezing. We tarried with Brother Cyphers to warm up. My fingers suffered terribly, but they were not frozen. The last five miles was alongside the river. A keen breeze blew directly in our faces. I was so unfortunate as to freeze my face pretty severely. It is very sore.",
