    "word": "Ministers' Work. \n\n     The Auditing Committee has not always tried with most humble prayer for guidance, to act in every case toward the servants of Jesus Christ as they would to the person of Christ, or as they themselves would wish to be treated. But, said Christ, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" It is a very serious matter that men, by the word of their own \n\n\n                      -14- \n\nmouth, and some in a hardened sang-froid manner, have decided what means shall go to the workers in the field. I will give you a chapter in my experience. We have found it necessary to build a home, and have hired carpenters, painters and others to do the several portions of the work. The master workman has two dollars per day, working eight hours only. As soon as the eight hours are over, the tools are laid aside, and work ceases. These men do not receive according to the amount of work done, but according to the hours worked. If a man is not an apt, quick, workman, but loiters over his work, that is the loss of the one who pays him. Another may be a much quicker workman, showing that he has intellect and can use it; his aptitude and correct judgement may be a treasure to him and a satisfaction to his employer, but he may receive only the same wages. After the week's work is done, and payment is made, the amount of work done has nothing to do with the sum received. A slow un-profitable man never thinks it his duty to make up for his want of sharp thought, but receives his pay as his right. These men have not the burden of dealing with human minds. Senseless timber and building materials are all they are dealing with. They can hammer just as hard and loud and energetically as they please, and it hurts not the soulless material.",
