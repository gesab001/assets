    "word": "The canvasser must not be self-inflated. In his association with others he must not make himself conspicuous, or talk in a boastful way; for this would disgust intelligent, sensible people. He must not be selfish, overbearing, or domineering. Very many have settled it in their minds that they can not read one in a thousand of \n21\nthe books that are published; and when the canvasser makes known his business, the door of the heart often closes firmly against him. Hence the great need of doing his work with tact, and in a humble, prayerful spirit. He should be familiar with the word of God, and have words at his command to unfold the precious truth, and to show the great value of the pure reading matter he carries.",
