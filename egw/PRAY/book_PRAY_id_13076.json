    "word": "I have enjoyed much peace of mind and sweet communion with God the last week. I have not been well; for a week back I overlabored--one week ago last Sabbath and Sunday and in private labor. But I felt such a sweet evidence that God heard me pray for Edson, that it paid me for all my burden and labor. He seems so much better than he did. Willie and he have come together by confession and tears. Lucinda, God helped me to pray and hold on to poor deceived Edson till victory came, light broke in, and Edson surrendered to God. Praise \n\n\n                                     -36- \n\nthe Lord for His merciful kindness.--Letter 58, 1876, pp. 1, 2. (To Lucinda Hall, April 6, 1876.)",
