    "word": "Prayer is the key that unlocks the storehouse of heaven. The churches have been losing their power. We must have faith in God. We must have a firmer dependence on Him who is the Owner of the universe. The cause of God needs consecrated workers, and it needs money. What shall we do?

Let us lay the whole situation before God, because He alone can supply that which we must have in order to enter new fields. He says, Advance, and we are not to wait till the money is in sight. There is to be no failure on our part. \n\n\n                                   -339-",
