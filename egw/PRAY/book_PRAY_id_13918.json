    "word": "MR No. 1365 - Consecration to Present Service to God\n\n  (Written Feb. 5, 1907, from Sanitarium, California, to N. D. Faulkhead.) \n\n\n     I was pleased to receive the information that you are again connected with the publishing work. May the Lord strengthen and encourage you day by day, is my prayer. Establish yourself in the strength of the Lord. You may put your trust in Him, for He will be your shield and buckler. We are nearing the close of this earth's history. If I do not meet you again on this earth, I hope to meet you in the city of our God. I think we shall all rejoice when the conflict is over.",
