    "word": "A PLACE TO FLEE THAT IS ALWAYS OPEN.\u2014The way to the throne of God is always open. You cannot always be on your knees in prayer, but your silent petitions may constantly ascend to God for strength and guidance. When tempted, as you will be, you may flee to the secret place of the Most High. His everlasting arms will be underneath you.\u2014(In Heavenly Places, 86.)",
