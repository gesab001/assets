    "word": "Workers Without Large Families Wanted.--Now I want you to consider my request and send workers here. We can get along in Australia better than they can in New Zealand. But there is great need of workers in New Zealand. I cry to you in America, Come over and help us. I pray the Lord to give you wisdom and judgment whom to select. Do get some man and his wife who will not feel it is their first work to fill their house with children, and give to these the care and charge they should give to the churches. Do not send over here a numerous family, for this will engross half the time of the man and his wife to take care of them. Do send us true missionaries who believe the end of all things is at hand, and at this time they have a higher work than to fill their houses and hands with the little children, who in no case must be neglected. Workers, Brother Olsen, unselfish workers, who have an eye single to the glory of God; men and women who for Christ's sake, for the building up of Christ's kingdom, will keep self and animal passions under control, and give themselves unreservedly to the work! There is so much needed to be done in this crisis.--Letter 50, 1892, p. 6. (Written from Preston, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, March 12, 1892, to Elder O. A. Olsen.) \n\n\n                                    -74-",
