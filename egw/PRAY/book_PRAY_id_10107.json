    "word": "In the visions of the night I have been bearing a decided testimony that the Lord Jesus will be found of all who will seek Him with the whole heart, and lay hold of Him by faith. I was addressing you with intensity of earnestness. Answer the prayer of Christ for unity, and put away the suspicions with which Satan has been trying to lead you astray. Dismiss the enemy, and then the Spirit of the Lord will lift up for you a standard against the enemy. . . .",
