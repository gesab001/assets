    "word": "Human help is feeble. But we may unite in seeking help and favor from Him who has said, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" Divine power is infallible. Then let us come to God, pleading for the guidance of His Holy Spirit. Let our united prayers ascend to the throne of grace. Let our requests be mingled with praise and thanksgiving.",
