    "word": "The Lord has light and wisdom for His people, which they should expect, receive, and cherish. Let there be decided changes made. Let those who have been accusers, and who have stood ready to take offense at any word or move that seemed to them to be ill-advised, humble their hearts, and pray that the spirit of division and dissension may be taken away. The Lord has a work for all to do who will submit to be worked by His Holy Spirit.",
