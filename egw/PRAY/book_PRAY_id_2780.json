    "word": "Let ministers teach church-members that in order to grow in spirituality, they must carry the burden that the Lord has laid upon them,--the burden of leading souls into the truth. Those who are not fulfilling their responsibility should be visited, prayed with, labored for. Do not lead the people to depend upon you as ministers; teach them rather that they are to use their talents in giving the truth to those around them. In thus working they will have the co-operation of heavenly angels, and will obtain an experience that will increase their faith, and give them a strong hold on God. \n\n\n                                             [201]",
