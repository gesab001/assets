    "word": "Consider, I pray you, the solemn lesson of this parable. The dresser of the vineyard pleads for a respite for the doomed fig-tree; but if it still bear no fruit, he himself declares, \u201cAfter that thou shalt cut it down.\u201d May not this be the position of some now before me? May they not be even now receiving the last trial? The divine illumination, the example of perfect goodness, are granted us. From time to time, new \n181\nopportunities, new lessons, are given. And what will be the result? If we are careless and neglectful, we know not how soon the word may be spoken of us, \u201cCut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?\u201d",
