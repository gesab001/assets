    "word": "Identified with His Church \n\n     God has a church, a chosen people; and could all see as I have seen how closely Christ identifies Himself with His people, no such message would be heard as the one that denounces the church as Babylon. God has a people who are laborers together with Him, and they have gone straight forward, having His glory in view. Listen to the prayer of our Representative in heaven: \"Father, I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am; that they may behold My glory.\" Oh, how the divine Head longed to have His church with Him! They had fellowship with Him in His suffering and humiliation, \n                                                                           21\nand it is His highest joy to have them with Him to be partakers of His glory. Christ claims the privilege of having His church with Him. \"I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.\" To have them with Him is according to covenant promise and agreement with His Father. He reverently presents at the mercy seat His finished redemption for His people. The bow of promise encircles our Substitute and Surety as He pours out His petition of love, \"Father, I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am; that they may behold My glory.\" We shall behold the King in His beauty, and the church will be glorified.",
