    "word": "Present these thoughts to the persons who come asking for your prayers: We are human; we cannot read the heart, or know the secrets of your life. These are known only to yourself and \n\n\n                        -46- \n\nGod. If you now repent of your sin, if any of you can see that in any instance you have walked contrary to the light given you of God, and have neglected to give honor to the body, the temple of God, but by wrong habits have degraded the body which is Christ's property, make confession of these things to God. Unless you are wrought upon by the Spirit of God in a special manner to confess your sins of a private nature, to man, do not breathe them to any soul. Christ is your Redeemer; he will take no advantage of your humiliating confessions. If you have sin of a private character, confess it to Christ, who is the only mediator between God and man. \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\" If you have sinned by withholding from God his own in tithes and offerings, confess your guilt to God and to the Church, and heed the injunction that he has given you: \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\"",
