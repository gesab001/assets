    "word": "ABRAHAM PRAYED TO GOD WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF A CHILD PLEADING WITH HIS FATHER.\u2014Two of the heavenly messengers departed, \n125\nleaving Abraham alone with Him whom he now knew to be the Son of God. And the man of faith pleaded for the inhabitants of Sodom. Once he had saved them by his sword, now he endeavored to save them by prayer. Lot and his household were still dwellers there; and the unselfish love that prompted Abraham to their rescue from the Elamites, now sought to save them, if it were God\u2019s will, from the storm of divine judgment.",
