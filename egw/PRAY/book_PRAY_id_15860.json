    "word": "Let our Brother Nicola now consider that the Lord has pointed out that changes should be made in the faculty. It would not be wise to consent for one to remain longer who has been years as the highest authority and yet has not filled the position to build up the school, for he would certainly be tempted, and would tempt others, to be dissatisfied and would create a disorganized state of things. Brother Melendy\u2014 who has also been on the farm\u2014would have a chance to be proved, for the time has\n123\ncome when experiments must be made and able, capable men come in who will work decidedly to make changes for the better. And if Brother Melendy can unite as a Christian with Brother Rogers to work decided changes, then in prayer and faith, and in all humility of mind, let these men unite. The Lord will bless them and will work with them, giving them wisdom and His grace to improve in all excellency of Christian character. The worker for the Master must become intelligent in regard to the situation and, as a wise man, give an example to his students that he heeds the words of Christ and practices them in his individual experience. There is great room for improvement in many things.",
