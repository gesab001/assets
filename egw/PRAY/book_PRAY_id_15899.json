    "word": "As you cultivate respect for one another, you will learn to respect Jesus Christ. You are to show no preference, for the Lord does not show preferences to his chosen ones. He says, \"I call you not servants, but friends; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth; but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\" This is the confidence that the Lord would have you cherish toward one another. Unless you do this more than you have in the past, you will not walk and work under the dictation of the Spirit of God. God would have you united in pleasant cords of companionship. As the Lord's workmen, you are to open your plans to one another. These plans must be carefully and prayerfully considered, because those who do not do this the Lord will leave to stumble in their own supposed wisdom and superior greatness.",
