    "word": "Do not strike your children a blow until everything else had failed. Many times you will find that if you will reason with them kindly, they will not need to be whipped. And such a method of dealing will lead them to have confidence in you. They will make you their confidant. They will come to you and say, \"I did wrong today at such a time, and I want you to forgive me and to ask God to forgive me.\" I have gone through scenes like this, and therefore I know. I have adopted children, and have tried to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and I had success in this work. I thank the Lord with heart and soul and voice that I can see today some of these children occupying responsible \n\n\n                                 -104- \n\npositions in the work of God. I am thankful that I had courage, when they did wrong, to deal with them firmly, to pray with them, and to keep the standards of God's Word before them. I am glad that I presented to them the promises made to the overcomer, and the rewards offered to those who are faithful.",
