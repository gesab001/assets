    "word": "In Brighton several have taken their position on the Sabbath. In Williamstown also some have decided to obey the truth. There was not a Sabbath-keeper in the place when the tent was set up there, but the interest has steadily increased since camp meeting, several are now in the valley of decision. I speak in the hall in that place next Sunday afternoon. O my son, I pray for the Lord to work in His own way upon the minds of the people, that a healthy church may be raised up in Williamstown. Already the matter of erecting a church building in this place is under serious consideration. It can be done, and must be done at once. Besides laboring for these who are just hearing the truth, we find work to do in setting things in order among ourselves, that the machinery may run without friction.",
