    "word": "MR No. 484 - Distinction Between the Sacred and the Common\n\n     This experience of Brother Ballenger's carries me back to my first experience in the message in correcting errors that came in among us after the passing of the time in 1844. The believers were sadly disappointed and scattered in different localities in small companies. Certain ones, who claimed to be taught of the Lord would visit these companies, and in prayer and song and preaching they would introduce to the believers sentiments of a fanatical nature, sentiments that were misleading to the people of God.",
