    "word": "I am instructed by the great teacher to say to those in the Southern field who are now passing through trial: Watch and pray and believe. Do your best. The present discouraging aspect will change when you change in word and spirit and action, becoming one with Christ. Try it. Then with joy you will bear witness that Christ's yoke is easy and His burden light. \n\n\n                                 (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
