    "word": "Keep close to your Redeemer. He has helped you in a marked manner, favoring you with privileges and opportunities. If you will continue to learn of Him, His meekness and lowliness, He will give you rest and peace. Make God your Counselor. If you think there is a wrong understanding at the Review and Herald or among the men at present in authority, do not move hastily. Be calm. They are on test and trial, and you, my son, are also on test and trial. If you will walk wisely, the Lord will work for you. Let your determination be, In all my service to God I will endeavor to renew on earth the harmony of heaven. Place yourself where the prayer, \"Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven,\" is fulfilled in you. Amid the strife and discord that predominates on the earth, the lives of God's people are to answer this prayer.",
