    "word": "\"The Work Before Us \n\n     \"'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.' is the commission Christ has given us. This is our great missionary charter, and the Saviour has declared: 'Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.' 'All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations.' Success will reward obedience to this command. Go just where the Lord sends you, to bear His message and do His work. Souls are to be saved. How?--By being brought to a knowledge of the truth. 'Sanctify them through Thy truth,' the Saviour prayed. Acquaintance with God's truth is the only means of sanctification.",
