    "word": "Persons proposed going to the Methodist house which was open for their reception and more convenient and better ventilated. They stated that quite a number were already there. One cried out, \"Divide the preachers.\"  Your father made answer [that] he  would not venture to try the experiment, fearing he would not get his share of hearers. Finally a general move was made to the meetinghouse which was crowded and extra seats prepared. I had a very respectful, attentive congregation. I spoke one hour and a half, with freedom. The meeting closed well. We have another appointment out tonight. May the Lord go with us and aid us in our labor, is our prayer. [Letter to Ellen White's son, W. C. White]--Lt 17, 1870.",
