    "word": "My brethren [A. G.] Daniells, [W. A.] Colcord, and [G. B.] Starr, there is a decided testimony to be borne by all our ministers in all our churches. God has permitted this apostasy to take place in order to show how little dependence can be placed in man. We are always to look to God. His word is not Yea and Nay, but Yea and Amen. All our labors to bring souls to a knowledge of the truth will be null and void unless we shall so present the truth as to work a decided reformation in the heart. The work must proceed from inward to outward, transforming the character of all who receive the \n\n\n                                      -364- \n\ntruth. We are not to throw our arms about the men who are Satan's masterpieces for working out his will, as were the opposers on the campground at Adelaide. Truth is to be proclaimed in warnings that will make hearts tremble in contrition before God. The sharp, clean-cut testimony must be borne. I hope that all who can possibly do so will come to this first term of school, where the Bible will be made the most important line of study. God help you all to go forth with the sword of the Spirit, which cuts both ways, is my prayer. \"Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves\" (Matthew 10:16). Make no compromise with those who have apostatized, but treat them kindly, giving no occasion for your good to be evil spoken of.--Letter 1, 1897, pp. 1-6. (To the Brethren and Sisters of the Adelaide church, April 22, 1897.)",
