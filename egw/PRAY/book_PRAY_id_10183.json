    "word": "Good works do not purchase the love of God, but they reveal that we possess that love. If we surrender our will and way to God, we will not work for God's love; we will obey the commandments of God because it is right to do thus. The disciple John wrote, \"We love him, because he first loved us\" (1 John 4:19). The true spiritual life will be revealed in every soul who is doing service for Christ. Those who are alive to Christ are imbued with His spirit, and they cannot help working in His vineyard. They work the work of God. Let every soul think prayerfully, that he may act consistently.--Manuscript 120, Aug. 23, 1899, \"Go, Work Today in My Vineyard.\"",
