    "word": "In praying for the sick, it is essential to have faith; for it is in accordance with the word of God. \"The fervent and effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\" So we can not discard praying for the sick, and we should feel very sad if we could not have the privilege of approaching God, to lay before him all our \n\n\n                      -53- \n\nweaknesses and our infirmities, to tell the compassionate Saviour all about these things, believing that he hears our petitions. Sometimes answers to our prayers come immediately: sometimes we have to wait patiently, and continue earnestly to plead for the things that we need, our cases being illustrated by the case of the importunate solicitor for bread. \"Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight,\" etc. This lesson means more than we can imagine. We are to keep on asking, even if we do not realize the immediate response to our prayers. \"I say unto you, Ask and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\"",
