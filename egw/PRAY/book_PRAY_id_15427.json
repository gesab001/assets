    "word": "September 28, 1906 \n\n     I have been writing from two this morning until six, when W. C. White left for his journey to Washington I had written eighteen pages of letter paper for him to take with him. (322) I could not get the matter copied at so early an hour, but thought he could take it with him in the original writing. After he had gone I wrote eighteen pages more. Before he left we had a season of prayer, and the Lord gave us His peace.",
