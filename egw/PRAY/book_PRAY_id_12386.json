    "word": "Meeting commenced in the tent at ten a.m. with about sixty attendance. Brethren Olsen and Matteson spoke yesterday forenoon. Brother Matteson spoke in the evening to a congregation of about three hundred. The best attention was given and all were much pleased with the result of the meeting. It is the first tent that has been pitched in Sweden. We pray that this may prove a success. Everything is favorable now for a good attendance. Oh, that the seed of truth may be planted in the hearts of many who have never even heard that there is such a people as Seventh-day Adventists!",
