    "word": "Saul was a learned teacher in Israel, but while [he was] under the influence of blind error and prejudice Christ reveals Himself to him and then places him in communication with His church, the light of the world. They were to instruct this educated, popular orator in the Christian religion. In Christ's stead, Ananias touches his eyes that they may receive sight. In Christ's stead he lays his hands upon him, and praying in Christ's name, Saul receives the Holy Ghost. All is done in the name and authority of Christ.",
