    "word": "You have been presented before me as in doubt and despair. Christ said of you as He said to Peter, \"Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not\" (Luke 22:31, 32). I bring to you good news; Jesus loves you, tempest-tossed soul. You have not made shipwreck of faith, although Satan has tried to make you believe that you have done this. Look and live. Come to Christ just as you are. Take Him as your personal Saviour.",
