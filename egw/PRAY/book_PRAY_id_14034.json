    "word": "I have earnestly prayed for light in reference to going east and I have now decided my work is here, to write and do those things that the Spirit of God shall dictate. I am seeking earnestly for the higher life. Mary and myself are at work as hard as we can. God in His providence has given me my work. I dare not leave it. We will pray that God may sustain you, but I see no light for me east.--Letter 27, 1876. \n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. January 22, 1989. Entire Letter.",
