    "word": "One thing alarms me: When you are cautioned or reproved, you act exactly as Elder Canright has acted for years. He rose up just as you do. He justified himself, and thought himself misjudged and abused. Because he pleased the tastes of the people, he regarded himself as all right. Why do you act so pettish when your course is questioned? Do you think there is no danger at all in your case? Are your eyes blinded that you fail to discern any danger? Because so many are foolish enough to flatter, praise, and extol you, does it bring you evidence that you are sinless? Because the Lord watches your footsteps, and, seeing that they may go in wrong paths, sends you counsel and reproof, or consolation, as the case requires, will you rise up against it? Who can know his own faults? You may make assertions, and they may be honestly made, but, after all, they may be made because you do not see your danger. Real, living, Christian principles that rule the heart at all times, and under all circumstances, will make you an overcomer and a living channel of light. It will be nothing short of a delusion to entertain the idea that you are in no danger. I tell you that you are in danger. You need to walk carefully and prayerfully before God.                          Ellen G. White. \n\n                                               -",
