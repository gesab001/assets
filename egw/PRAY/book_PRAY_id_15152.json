Were our practices in harmony with the command of our Lord, the result would be glorious.

And the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved Me\" [John 17:20-23].",
