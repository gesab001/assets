    "word": "Changing to a Sweet Disposition.--\"Watch and pray\" is an injunction often repeated in the Scriptures. In the lives of those who obey this injunction there will be an undercurrent of happiness that will bless all with whom they are brought in contact. Those who are sour and cross in disposition will become sweet and gentle; those who are proud will become meek and lowly.--CT 293 (1913).",
