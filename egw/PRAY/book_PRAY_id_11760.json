    "word": "It is well pleasing to God that we have praise and prayer and religious services, but Bible religion must be brought into all we do, and give sanctity to each daily duty. The Lord's will must become man's will in everything. The Holy One of Israel has given rules of guidance to all, and these rules of guidance are to be strictly followed; for they form the standard of character. No one can swerve from the first principles of righteousness without sinning. But our religion is misinterpreted and despised by unbelievers, because so many who profess to hold the truth do not practise its principles in dealing with their fellow-men.",
