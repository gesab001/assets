    "word": "The question is asked, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\" Hear the triumphant cry of victory from the apostle Paul, that hero of faith: \"I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor death, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" \"I know in whom I have believed,\" We are not to be ignorant as to whose precious blood was shed for us, that we may rejoice in a personal Saviour. Satan desires to sift us, every one, as wheat; but thank God, our Advocate is praying for us.",
