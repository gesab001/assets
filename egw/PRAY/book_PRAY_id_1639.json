    "word": "How wonderful is the way of our Lord!  It is His glory to impart to us the things we most need. In the night season I have seen the arm of Omnipotence outstretched to guide us, and lead us onward and still onward. \"Go forward,\" the Lord said. \"I understand the whole case, and I will send you help. Continue to pray. Have faith in Me: it is for My name's glory that you ask, and you shall receive. I will be honored before those who are watching critically for your financial failure. They shall see the truth triumph gloriously. And whatsoever ye ask in My name believing, ye shall receive.\"",
