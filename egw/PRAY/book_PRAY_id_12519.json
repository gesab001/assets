    "word": "There is perfect harmony between the instruction of the Old Testament and that of the New. The Lord Jesus Himself gave to Moses the principles that were to be given to Israel. Lessons of mercy, goodness, generosity, and strict honesty were given by Christ in the Old Testament, and were repeated by Him when He came in human flesh to our world. Shall we not earnestly and prayerfully study these lessons and practice the principles which the Lord has given?--Letter 83, 1896, pp. 14, 15. (To Elder O. A. Olsen, May 22, 1896.)",
