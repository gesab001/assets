    "word": "\"As we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office; we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.\" \"Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love, in honor preferring one another; not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. Bless them which persecute you; bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.\" Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.\" \n\n\n                         -51-",
