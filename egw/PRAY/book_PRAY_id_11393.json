    "word": "Frequent Prayer and Counsel. \n\n     Those who labour at camp-meetings should frequently engage in prayer and counsel together, that they may labour intelligently. There are many things that demand attention at the camp-meetings; but the ministers should take time to meet together every day for prayer and counsel. You should know that all things are drawing in even lines--\"that you are standing,\" as the words were spoken to me, \"shoulder to shoulder, marching right ahead, and not drawing off.\" When the work is carried on in this way, there is unity of heart, and there will be harmony of action. This will be a wonderful means of bringing the blessing of God upon the people.",
