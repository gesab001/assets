    "word": "Who is desirous of becoming truly repentant? What must he do? He must come to Jesus, just as he is, without delay. He must believe that the word of Christ is true, and, believing the promise, ask, that he may receive. When sincere desire prompts men to pray, they will not pray in vain. The Lord will fulfill His word, and will give the Holy Spirit to lead to repentance. . . . With prayer he [the repentant sinner] will mingle faith, and not only believe in but obey the precepts of the law. . . . He will renounce all habits and associations that tend to draw the heart from God. \n                                                                           111",
