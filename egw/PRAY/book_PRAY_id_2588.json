    "word": "Some of our preachers are killing themselves by long, tedious praying and loud speaking, when a lower tone would make a better impression, and save their own strength. Now, while you go on regardless of the laws of life and health, and follow the impulse of the moment, do not charge it upon God if you break down. Many of you waste time and strength in long preliminaries and excuses as you begin to speak. Instead of apologizing because you are about to address the people, you should begin your labor as though God had something for you to say to them. Some use up nearly half an hour in making apologies; thus the time is frittered away, and when they get to their subject, where they are desirous of fastening the points of truth, the people are wearied out, and cannot see their force or be impressed with them. You should make the essential points of present truth as distinct as mile-posts, so that the people will understand them. They will then see the arguments you want to present, and the positions you want to sustain.",
