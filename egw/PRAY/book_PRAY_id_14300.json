    "word": "In the apostles' day there were no hasty movements in regard to their selection of men to important church duties. It was with much trembling and fear that they moved. Although these very men who were to choose others to an important office were men of faith and full of the Holy Spirit, men who had healed the sick and done many mighty miracles, yet it was with much prayer and reliance upon God that they chose those who should bear the burdens of the church. I was shown that the men who act in the church are all out of their place. The church cannot progress with such ones to act for them. The church would be far better off without anyone to lead than the ones who act as leaders, for then all would feel a measure of responsibility.",
