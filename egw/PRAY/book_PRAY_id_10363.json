    "word": "We may commune with God in our hearts; we may walk in companionship with Christ. When engaged in our daily labor, we may breathe out our heart\u2019s desire, inaudible to any human ear; but that word cannot die away into silence, nor can it be lost. Nothing can drown the soul\u2019s desire. It rises above the din of the street, above the noise of machinery. It is God to whom we are speaking, and our prayer is heard.\u2014Messages to Young People, pp. 249, 250",
