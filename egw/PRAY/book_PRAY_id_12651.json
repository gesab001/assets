    "word": "Take not your troubles to man, who may have no greater wisdom than you yourself. Take your troubles to Him who hears and answers prayer. Labor, labor with this poor soul and that poor soul. Keep your head out of books and your hand from writing. Seek the salvation of those who are ready to perish. How earnestly should we be engaged in laboring for souls as they that must give an account.--Letter 119, 1900, pp. 1, 5-8. (To Elder and Mrs. G. C. Tenney, August 2, 1900.) \n\nReleased November 13, 1973.",
