    "word": "There is a great work of education to be carried on. The teachers should often pray for and with the children and youth, that they may \"behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" They should teach the youth their accountability to God, and help them to understand what Jesus expects of them. Exert every influence you can possibly command to interest them in the Scriptures. Labor for their souls, that they themselves shall become zealous workers, using their talents to impart to others that which has been imparted to them.--TSS 83.",
