Haskell and Elder and Mrs. Ings.) \n\n\n     It may seem strange to you that we have not said more in regard to Elder Ings and his wife coming to America. We believe the Lord's hand was in their going to Europe. We were very fearful that they could not stand the climate, but the Lord in His providence has sustained them. They may even have had better health in the dismal climate of London than if they had been in California. We cannot say in regard to this matter. We would not limit the Holy One of Israel; He can do mercifully abundantly above all that we are able to think. And although we have pitied you and prayed for you and Elder Haskell much, I am convinced that we have had too little faith and too limited a vision of God's power to protect and save you in the dark and dismal fogs of London.",
