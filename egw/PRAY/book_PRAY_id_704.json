    "word": "A \"Monkey Wrench\" in the Wheels--The sixth chapter of Isaiah has a deep and  important lesson for every one of God's workmen.  Study it with humility and earnest prayer.  The first and second chapters of Ezekiel should also be carefully studied.  The wheels within wheels represented in this symbol was confusion to the finite eye.  But a hand of infinite wisdom was revealed amid the wheels.  Perfect order is brought out of the confusion.  Every wheel works in its right place, in perfect harmony with every other part of the machinery.",
