    "word": "We must not only pray in Christ\u2019s name, but by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This explains what is meant when it is said that the Spirit \u201cmaketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.\u201d Romans 8:26. Such prayer God delights to answer. When with earnestness and intensity we breathe a prayer in the name of Christ, there is in that very intensity a pledge from God that He is about to answer our prayer \u201cexceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.\u201d Ephesians 3:20.",
