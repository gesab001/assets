    "word": "The God-fearing surgeon, when required to operate in critical cases, will call upon God for wisdom and help. And the Lord will honor His servant at such times, guiding the instrument he handles in the fear of God. At such times it is of the greatest importance that the physician be calm and able to speak words of faith and trust in the One who is our Creator and our King. Many times this manifestation of calm trust in God will decide the case favorably, for the confidence of the physician in unseen agencies, his faith that his prayers in behalf of the afflicted one will be heard, will give confidence, and balance the mind of the one who is passing through the crisis. And the faith that will lay hold upon the Lord in the hour of peril will be respected.",
