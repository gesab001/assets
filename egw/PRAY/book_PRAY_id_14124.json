    "word": "We must pray more, and walk more humbly and more by faith. Christ was perfect in His humanity, and the more faith we have in Him as our sufficiency, the more humbly we walk with God, [and] the more entire our consecration, the less intrusion of self will there be between God and man. The grace of Christ must be an abiding presence in the soul day by day. Only thus can we endure the seeing of Him who is invisible.",
