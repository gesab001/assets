    "word": "A Way Through the Dark Shadow.--Christ's prayer on the banks of the Jordan includes every one who will believe in Him. The promise that you are accepted in the Beloved comes to you. God said, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" This means that through the dark shadow which Satan has thrown athwart your pathway Christ has cleaved the way for you to the throne of the infinite God. He has laid hold of almighty power, and you are accepted in the Beloved (GCB April 4, 1901).",
