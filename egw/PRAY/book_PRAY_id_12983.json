    "word": "MR No. 685 - The Work of Reconversion Cannot Be Hidden\n\n     Tremendous responsibilities rest upon us, and we must awaken out of our indifferent slumber. The soul cannot be sustained except by the right exercise of its affections. Misfortunes may come; changes may take place; but the soul's relation to Christ need never change. As we put forth energy in many places to sow the seeds of truth, we give evidence that we believe in a prayer-hearing and a prayer-answering God. Every energy that man possesses is to be sanctified.",
