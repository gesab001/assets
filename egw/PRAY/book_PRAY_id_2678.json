    "word": "Brethren in the faith, express no doubts. Follow closely your Guide. You must dispense with him before you can lose your way; for the Lord has hedged you in on every side. In the darkest hour, Jesus will be our light. \u201cThe path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\u201d [Proverbs 4:18.] It is an exalted privilege to be connected with Jesus. In every condition of trial, we may have the consolation of his presence. We may live in the very atmosphere of heaven. Our enemies may thrust us into prison, but prison walls cannot cut off the communication between Christ and our souls. One who sees our every weakness, who is acquainted with every trial, is above all earthly powers; and angels can come to us in lonely cells, bringing light and peace from heaven. The prison will be as a palace, for the rich in faith dwell there; and the gloomy walls will be lighted up with heavenly light, as when Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises at midnight in the Philippian dungeon. Bunyan \n425\nwas confined in Bedford jail; and thence issued a light that has illuminated the pathway to the celestial city.",
