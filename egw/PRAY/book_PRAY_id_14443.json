    "word": "South Lancaster, Tuesday, October 21, 1890 \n\n     Thank the Lord for His mercy and His goodness to me.

I presented my case before God, who knows my infirmities and who can relieve me, for He is able to make His strength perfect in my weakness. I presented in the arms of my faith Sister Haskell and Sister Wheeler, precious souls. . . .",
