As they ventured to meet by night on mountain-side or lonely moor, they were chased by dragoons, and dragged away to life-long slavery in the galleys. \u201cThe purest, the most refined, and the most intelligent of the French, were chained, in horrible torture, amidst robbers and assassins.\u201d Others, more mercifully dealt with, were shot down in cold blood, as, unarmed and helpless, they fell upon their knees in prayer. Hundreds of aged men, defenseless women, and innocent children were left dead upon the earth at their place of meeting. In traversing the mountain-side or the forest, where they had been accustomed to assemble, it was not unusual to find \u201cat every \n272\nfour paces dead bodies dotting the sward, and corpses hanging suspended from the trees.\u201d Their country, \u201claid waste with the sword, the ax, the fagot, was converted into a vast, gloomy wilderness.\u201d These atrocities were not committed during the Dark Ages, but in that brilliant era \u201cwhen science was cultivated, and letters flourished; when the divines of the court and the capital were learned and eloquent men, who greatly affected the graces of meekness and charity.\u201d",
