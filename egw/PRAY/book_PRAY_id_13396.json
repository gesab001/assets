    "word": "As I was praying, a soft light filled the room, bringing with it a fragrance as of beautiful flowers. Then a voice seemed to say, \"Accept the invitation of My servant, John Kellogg, to make his house your home. I have appointed him as My physician, and you can be an encouragement to him.\" This is why I am staying at Dr. Kellogg's house.

You are not to lean on any human being. \n\n\n                                   -205-",
