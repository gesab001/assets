    "word": "Probation is about to close. In heaven the edict will soon go forth, \"It is done.\" \"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be \n\n\n                 -4- \n\nrighteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be\" [Revelation 22:11, 12]. Then the last prayer for sinners will have been offered, the last tear shed, the last warning given, the last entreaty made. The sweet voice of mercy will be heard no more.",
