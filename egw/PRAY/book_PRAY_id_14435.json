    "word": "South Lancaster, Mass., Wednesday, October 15, 1890 \n\n     The morning of the 15th was quite cool but pleasant. We enjoyed a precious season of prayer with the family and then bade them farewell, and the hack took us back to the depot. We stepped on the cars about 15 minutes past nine a.m. Many crowded into the cars. There were no seats. We were requested to go into the chair car until we reached Utica. We paid nothing extra for this privilege. We find we must economize in every way possible. . . .",
