    "word": "I was at the forenoon meeting on Sunday. The reading of the article of Elder Olsen's was deferred for this day. Brother [J. S.] Washburn selected a portion of the article for several to read. A Methodist exhorter and his wife are soundly converted to the truth--Baker, I think, is his name. While reading the portion assigned him, which was a quotation from the Testimonies, he tried and tried to read it, but he had to wipe away the tears so often, and then his glasses, of course, were dimmed, and when he came to some portions of the quotations he just broke down and cried. He turned to Brother Washburn and handed him the paper and said, \"You take it; I cannot read it.\" But all these pauses on that occasion only made the effect more impressive. Brother Washburn told him to take his time and read on. Then after reading we had a solemn season of prayer. I had the spirit of intercession, and there was deep feeling in the congregation. I then spoke about thirty minutes with much of the Spirit of the Lord upon me. All speak of these two meetings as being excellent.",
