    "word": "We are all hoping and praying that the treatment which you are taking for your eyes will prove successful. You need not feel that you must come home till you are fully ready, but we shall be very glad to see you when you can come. It seems strange and unnatural without you. We believe that the Lord God of Israel will help you. We depend upon Him to save to the uttermost, for He is our Redeemer. I hope that your eyes will be improving all the time you are away. I know that you have suffered much, and if you are permanently relieved we shall be so thankful and will give thanks to the Lord.",
