    "word": "We may ask of our Lord, knowing that we shall receive. We need more of Christ's humility and meekness, that we may have fervent charity among ourselves; then we may pray, then we may intercede with God. Thus we shall prove the truth of the word, \"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\" \"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him.\" But those whom the Lord would use are in great danger of getting on human stilts. There is earnest work to be done. There is need of walking with God. Then tracts right to the point will be issued.",
