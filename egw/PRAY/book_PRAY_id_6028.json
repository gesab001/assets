    "word": "TEACH YOUR CHILDREN TO RESPECT THE TIME FOR PRAYER.\u2014Your children should be educated to be kind, thoughtful of others, gentle, easy to be entreated, and, above everything else, to respect religious things and feel the importance of the claims of God. They should be taught to respect the hour of prayer; they should be required to rise in the morning so as to be present at family worship.\u2014(Child Guidance, 521.)",
