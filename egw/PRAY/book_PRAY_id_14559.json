    "word": "\"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon\" (Matthew 6:24). If you center your thoughts upon the world, you will be worldly; you cannot help but be. But if you weave into your life the principles of heaven, keeping your attention fixed on Christ, you will be prepared for association with the angels. Remember that God wants you to bring Christ into your business transactions just as surely as into the house of prayer. He wants us to bear the testimony that in a world corrupted by sin, human beings can live untainted by worldliness. He wants us to show that we are standing under the bloodstained banner of prince Emmanuel. He does not tell us that the path to heaven is a smooth one. He takes us to an eminence and shows us the powers of darkness arrayed against us. But He tells us that more than men are in the army fighting on the side of right. \"Be of good cheer,\" he says, \"I have overcome the world\" (John 16:33). \n\n\n                                    -325-",
