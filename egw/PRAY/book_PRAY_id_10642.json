    "word": "Enoch not only meditated and prayed, and put on the armor of watchfulness, but he came forth from his pleadings with God to plead with his fellow men. He did not mask the truth to find favor with unbelievers, thus neglecting their souls. This close connection with God gave him courage to work the works of God. Enoch walked with God and \"had the testimony that his ways pleased God.\" This is the privilege of every believer today. It is man dwelling with God, and God taking up His abode with man. \"I in them, and thou in me,\" says Jesus. To walk with God and have the witness that their ways please Him is an experience not to be confined to Enoch, to Elijah, to patriarchs, to prophets, to apostles, and to martyrs. It is not only the privilege but the duty of every follower of Christ to have Jesus enshrined in the heart, to carry Him with them in their lives; and they will indeed be fruit-bearing trees.--Manuscript 43, Aug. 2, 1900, \"The Prophet Enoch.\"",
