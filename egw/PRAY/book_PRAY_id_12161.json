    "word": "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I appeal to church members to arise and closely criticize themselves. Feel that this work is so important that you cannot engage in criticizing others. Reveal an indwelling Saviour. Then you will understand what it means to be a true missionary. You will bring a Christlike intensity into your work, and many souls will be saved through your earnest prayers and interested labors. Ms 148, 1899, pp. 2-14.
