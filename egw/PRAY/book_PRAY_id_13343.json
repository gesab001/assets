    "word": "Last Sabbath, before I rose to speak, the tent master told Brother Haskell that there had been a breakage in the gearing of the tent, and that two slender ropes were all that were keeping the tent from falling. He said that these ropes might snap at any minute. Brother Haskell kept praying that the Lord would keep us from harm and danger, and the Lord did hold the tent up by His own power. We felt thankful that no one was hurt. Just as soon as the Sabbath closed, the tent was quickly lowered, and the rope mended.--Letter 38, 1898. (Written to Edson and Emma White, Feb. 2, 1898, from Stanmore, Sydney, N.S.W.)",
