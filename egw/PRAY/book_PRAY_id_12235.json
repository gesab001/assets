    "word": "For a time after my last severe illness I feared that I should never be able to use my voice again. I tried to pray at family worship, but after I had uttered a word or two, no sound would come. My voice was gone. For a long time I had to keep silent; but the Lord has restored my voice to me, and I cannot be grateful enough to Him for this mercy. I am so thankful. I know that I have a testimony to bear, and I thank God that I can still be His witness. --Letter 150, 1902, pp. 1, 2. (To C. W. Irwin, Sept. 22, 1902.)",
