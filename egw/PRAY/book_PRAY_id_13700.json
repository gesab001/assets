    "word": "Our duty to the world is broad and deep. We are to do unto others as we would they should do unto us. The truth must go everywhere, and we want those who can plead with the Lord in prayer, who will bend the knee before God, abolishing the fashion which has come in among our people and has been transported by our workers to other countries, of standing like the Pharisees and praying to be heard of men. We want all who know God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, to bow low at His footstool, and pray that the world may hear the message of warning, that it may be caught up by those who hear it, and carried to those who know it not.",
