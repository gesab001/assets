    "word": "The prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His long life was filled up with noble service for his Master. He was a man \u201cgreatly beloved\u201d [Daniel 10:11.] of Heaven. Yet instead of claiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself with the really sinful of Israel, as he pleaded before God in behalf of his people: \u201cWe do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.\u201d \u201cWe have sinned, we have done wickedly.\u201d He declares, \u201cI was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people.\u201d And when at a later time the Son of God appeared, to give him instruction, he \n471\ndeclares, \u201cMy comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.\u201d [Daniel 9:18, 15, 20; 10:8.]",
