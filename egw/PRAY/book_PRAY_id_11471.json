    "word": "Special Efforts for the Youth \n\n     \"Ministers should form an acquaintance with the youth in their congregations. . . . Why should not this labor for the youth in our borders be regarded as the highest kind of missionary work. It will require the most delicate tact, the most thoughtful consideration, the most earnest prayer, that heavenly wisdom may be imparted. The youth are the objects of Satan's special attacks, but kindness, courtesy, that tender sympathy that flows from a heart filled with love to Jesus, will give you access to them. . . . . When the youth give their hearts to God, your care for them should not cease. Lay some spiritual responsibility upon them. Make them feel that they are expected to do something. The Lord chooses them because they are strong.\"--G. W. pp. 278, 279.",
