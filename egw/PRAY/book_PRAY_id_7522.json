    "word": "The lesson of self-control should begin with the infant in its mother's arms. The child should be taught that its will must be brought into subjection. . . . Who are these children committed to our care?--They are the younger members of the Lord's family. He says, Take these children and train them . . . so that they will be polished after the similitude of a palace, prepared to shine in the courts of My house. What an important work! . . . Remember that in your work the Creator of the universe will give you help. In His strength, and through His name, you can lead your children to be overcomers. Teach them to look to God for strength. Tell them that He hears their prayers. Teach them to overcome evil with good. Teach them to exert an influence that is elevating and ennobling. Lead them to unite with God, and then they will have strength to resist the strongest temptation. They will then receive the reward of the overcomer.",
