    "word": "This is also the most successful way of reaching the people; for by this means their attention is best secured. Unless the attention of the people is gained, all effort for them will be useless. The word of God cannot be understood by the inattentive.

They are convicted, and then it  is that they specially need your counsel, encouragement, and prayers. Many a  precious soul balances for a time, and then takes his position on the side of  error, because he does not have this personal effort at the right time.",
