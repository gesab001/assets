    "word": "MR No. 200 - Materials Needed for Angel Over Her Tent\n\n     Even very small children are to be under the rule of Christ. They can do missionary work in the family from their standpoint and the Lord will accept their service. They can speak their childlike words for Jesus, and awaken an echo in other young hearts. Many older people have been led to Jesus by the simple words of a child. In many instances children have put to shame those who have had many opportunities and much experience, but who have done little for the Master and whose talents are rusting from inaction.\"-- Ms 77, 1898, pp. 5, 6.
