    "word": "There is need in the Southern field of an office for the publication of the truth for this time. But the work of such an institution cannot be done with divided minds and divided interests. In order for the publishing house in Nashville to be a success, the workers must have a constant sense of the supervision of God, and they must consult together. If they are true Christians, they will be subject one to another. Let them wear the yoke of Christ, laboring together in love and unity. As they do this, the Lord will bless and strengthen them. Each worker is to be drawn to the other by the cords of Christ's love. There is no need of there being estrangement among them. All are embraced in Christ's prayer that the disciples might be one with Him as He is one with the Father.",
