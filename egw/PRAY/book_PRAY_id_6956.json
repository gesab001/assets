I have faith in your case. I do believe that the Lord has heard prayer in your behalf, and that He will work for your good and His own name's glory. He has said, \"Ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you\" (John 15:7). \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive\" (Matthew 21:22).",
