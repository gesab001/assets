    "word": "Choose Men Who Can Be Trusted--God will teach His people to move carefully, and to make wise choice of men who will not betray sacred trusts.  If in Christ's day the believers needed to be guarded in their choice of men for positions of responsibility, we who are living in this time certainly need to move with great discretion.  We are to present every case before God, and in earnest prayer ask Him to choose for us.--Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 264.",
