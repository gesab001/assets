    "word": "I am now located in the Pratt house under the hill on which the Retreat stands. The manifest working of the power of God in this matter is a cause of great thankfulness. Here I am retired from the strife of tongues. I decided that I could not make my home in Battle Creek, Healdsburg, or Oakland; and we made up our minds to wait and watch and pray for guidance as to where we should locate. It was a great surprise to us when this place was brought to our notice, and we saw plainly the hand of God in it. I was softened and subdued in spirit at the thought that God had selected this place for me, and I no longer questioned my duty in the matter of location. We acknowledge the unexpected interposition of Providence in our behalf under the most depressing circumstances. Light has shone amid uncertainty, and we now rejoice in certainty and in the peace of God. We do not doubt that God was the primary mover in the matter of our location, and may it be said of us as of the disciples, \"They glorified God.\" The Lord has placed us here, and we will praise him. We are thankful to be away from the din and confusion of the battle. We would not place ourselves where we would become the sport of Satan's inventions.",
