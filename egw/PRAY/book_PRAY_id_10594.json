    "word": "Many times you have almost gone over to the wrong side, but before the throne has stood your Saviour, the prints of the nails in His hands, interceding in your behalf. Pray for yourself, in the name of Christ. Pray earnestly, fervently, sincerely. I hope that your life may be spared, and that you may give yourself wholly to repentance. Come to the Lord, and surrender all to Him. You must, or you will be taken captive by the enemy.",
