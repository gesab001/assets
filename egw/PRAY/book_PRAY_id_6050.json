    "word": "GOD\u2019S PRESENCE MAKES TIMES OF PRAYER AND PUBLIC WORSHIP SACRED.\u2014True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His infinite greatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of the Unseen the heart of every child should be deeply impressed. The hour and place of prayer and the services of public worship \n200\nthe child should be taught to regard as sacred because God is there. And as reverence is manifested in attitude and demeanor, the feeling that inspires it will be deepened.\u2014(Education, 242, 243.)",
