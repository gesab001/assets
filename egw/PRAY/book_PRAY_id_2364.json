    "word": "To bow down when in prayer to God is the proper attitude to occupy. . . . But such an act was homage to be rendered to God alone . . . , the Ruler of the universe; and these three Hebrews refused to give such honor to any idol even though composed of pure gold. In doing so, they would, to all intents and purposes, be bowing to the king of Babylon. . . . They suffered the penalty. . . . But Christ came in person and walked with them through the fire, and they received no harm.",
