    "word": "SPEND MUCH TIME IN PRAYER.\u2014Let much time be spent in prayer and close searching of the word. Let all obtain the real facts of faith in their own souls through belief that the Holy Spirit will be imparted to them because they have a real hungering and thirsting after righteousness. . . . Let there be more praying, believing, and receiving, and more working together with God.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, 65, 66.)",
