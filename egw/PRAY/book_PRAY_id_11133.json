    "word": "This is a lesson to all in their spiritual experience. What an amount of worry would be saved if men would only trust in God. The bread of life is to be given to needy souls. And what a work is often made of the matter. There are long councils for devising plans, inventing new methods. There is a constant effort to get up entertainments to draw people to the church or the Sabbath-school. Like the disciples, the workers raise the question, Shall we go unto the villages and buy? What is the work to be done? Come unto Jesus. Humble faith and prayer will accomplish very much more than your long councils. Listen to the Saviour's invitation. Put your neck under his yoke. Accept his burdens. Receive that which he bestows. He says, \"My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\"",
