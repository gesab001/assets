    "word": "When the defiance of the law of Jehovah shall be almost universal, when His people shall be pressed in affliction by their fellow-men, God will interpose. The fervent prayers of His people will be answered, for He loves to have His people seek Him with all their heart, and depend upon Him as their Deliverer. He will be sought unto to do these things for His people, and He will arise as the protector and avenger of His people. The promise is, The Lord will avenge His own elect, which cry unto him day and night.",
