    "word": "Study the Scriptures \n\n     My brethren and sisters, old and young, when you have an hour of leisure open the Bible and store the mind with its precious truths. When engaged in labor, guard the mind, keep it stayed upon God, talk less and meditate more. Remember, \"Every idle word that men shall \n                                                                           416\nspeak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\" Matthew 12:36. Let your words be select; this will close a door against the adversary of souls. Let your day be entered upon with prayer; work as in God's sight. His angels are ever by your side, making a record of your words, your deportment, and the manner in which your work is done.",
