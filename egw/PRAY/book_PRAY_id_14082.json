    "word": "If you were all to come together and confess your mistakes, it would be revealed that some have had feelings of exaltation, and have desired the highest place; others have felt free to express a lack of harmony with the plans of their associates, and have felt like drawing apart. When all the workers in the Echo Office are partakers of the divine nature, they will draw together, in even lines. Then there will be more praying, with humility of soul. Our brethren there will then seek the Lord, confessing their own sins, and realizing their own defects of character. Thus great confusion could be avoided.",
