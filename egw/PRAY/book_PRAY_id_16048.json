    "word": "Never should a worker encourage one who is in need of instruction and help to go first to human agencies for an understanding of his duty. It is our privilege as laborers to pray together and to counsel together; but we are individually to seek God to know what he would have us do. When the Lord impresses the mind of one of his servants that he is to go to a certain place to labor, that man is not under obligation to go to a human being to know if it is right for him to do this.",
