    "word": "1032. I would come before the Lord with this petition: \"Lord, we cannot read the heart of this sick one, but thou knowest whether it is for the good of his soul and for the glory of thy name to raise him to health. In thy great goodness, compassionate this case, and let healthy action take place in the system. The work must be entirely thine own. We have done all that human skill can do; now, Lord, we lay this case at thy feet, work as only God can work, and if it be for thy good and for thy glory, arrest the progress of disease and heal this sufferer.\" \n                                                                           240\n. . . But after I have prayed earnestly for the sick, what then? Do I cease to do all I can for their recovery?--No, I work all the more earnestly, with much prayer that the Lord may bless the means which his own hand has provided; that he may give sanctified wisdom to co-operate with him in the recovery of the sick.--U. T., March 11, 1892.",
