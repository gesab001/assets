    "word": "The terrace stands alone, and on either side of the buildings are two acres of land. Everything is favorable in surroundings. A beautiful park is close by, and large, imposing buildings are all around. The deaf and dumb asylum, an institution for the blind, and the Wesleyan College are near by. The rents are high in this part of the city. We tried to secure a small wooden tenement which has none of the conveniences we have here, although they ask the same price as we pay now, $25.00 a month. Should we take a building in the terrace where the school is located, we should have to pay ten dollars per week. I cannot see how I could pay that sum; but they will try to secure it if they can, for they say that dollars and cents should not be taken into consideration if I can benefit the school. We are praying to the Lord to open the way if He would have us move near the school.",
