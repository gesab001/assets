    "word": "After the defeat of the Israelites at Ai, Joshua was lying upon his face before the ark, praying, when the Lord said unto him, \"Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have stolen, and dissembled, and they have put it even among their own stuff. . . . neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves \n                                                                           1521\nagainst tomorrow; for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thy enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.\"",
