    "word": "MR No. 407 - Intercessory Prayer\n\n     I remember in Battle Creek when there were those who felt the burden for the unconverted, and those who were in darkness and saw no light; then prayer meetings were appointed that they might make the strength of God their strength. In every case the heavenly intelligences worked with these efforts, and souls were saved.--Ms 32, 1893, p. 7. (Untitled, February 16, 1893.)",
