    "word": "In social meeting, prayer should be offered so that all may be edified; those who take part in this exercise should follow the example given in the Lord's beautiful prayer for the world. This prayer is simple, clear, comprehensive, and yet not long and spiritless, as the prayers offered in public sometimes are. These spiritless prayers might better not be uttered; for they are a mere form, without vital power, and they fail to bless or edify.",
