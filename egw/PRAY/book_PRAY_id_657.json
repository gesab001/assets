    "word": "HEALING OF SISTER TEMPLE\n \n     Having received a request to visit Sister Hastings, of New Ipswich, New Hampshire, who was greatly afflicted, we made the matter a subject of prayer, and obtained evidence that the Lord would go with us. On our way we stopped at Dorchester, with Brother Otis Nichols's family, and they told us of the affliction of Sister Temple of Boston. On her arm she had a sore, which caused her much anxiety. It had extended over the bend of the elbow. She had suffered great agony, and had in vain resorted to human means for relief. The last effort had driven the disease to her\n123\nlungs, and she felt that unless she obtained immediate help, the disease would end in consumption.",
