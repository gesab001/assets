    "word": "Students should have their own seasons of prayer, when they may offer fervent petitions in behalf of the principal and teachers of the school that they may be given physical strength, mental clearness, moral power, spiritual discernment, and be qualified by the grace of Christ to do the work with fidelity and fervent love.

Every day the student may exert a silent, prayerful influence, and thus co-operate with Christ, the Missionary in chief. \n                                                                           554",
