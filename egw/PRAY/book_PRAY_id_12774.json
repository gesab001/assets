    "word": "MR No. 446 - A Physician and Apostle\n\n[SEE STATEMENT IN EVANGELISM, P. 546:  \"THE WORK OF THE TRUE MEDICAL MISSIONARY IS LARGELY A SPIRITUAL WORK. IT INCLUDES PRAYER AND THE LAYING ON OF HANDS; HE THEREFORE SHOULD BE AS SACREDLY SET APART FOR HIS WORK AS IS THE MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL. THOSE WHO ARE SELECTED TO ACT THE PART OF MISSIONARY PHYSICIANS, ARE TO BE SET APART AS SUCH. THIS WILL STRENGTHEN THEM AGAINST THE TEMPTATION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE SANITARIUM WORK TO ENGAGE IN PRIVATE PRACTICE.\"]\n\n     Every physician can and ought to be a Christian, and if so he bears with him a cure of souls as well as bodies. He is doing the work of an apostle as well as of a physician.--Letter 36, 1893, p. 5. (To Dr. and Mrs. J. H. Kellogg, October 2, 1893.) \n\nReleased September 2, 1975.",
