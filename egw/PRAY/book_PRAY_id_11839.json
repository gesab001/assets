    "word": "There may be individuals who will make a rush to do something, and enter into some business they know nothing about. This God does not require. Think candidly, prayerfully, studying the word with all carefulness and prayerfulness, with mind and heart awake to hear the voice of God. He does not follow his own imagination, but weighs the words of God, and counsels, and seeks wisdom from God. When, in the providence of God, he has a work to be done by the human agent co-operating with the divine, he has a man to do that work, if he will heed the moving of the Holy Spirit upon his heart and mind. To understand the will of God is a great thing. Divine Wisdom has his hand hold of the living machinery in human agencies; men are selected as fitting instruments to do a given work; and O what a precious ability is given of God to man to know his fellow-man, so that he can use, through the grace of God, the human agencies, and organize a working company to do the best work, according to their recognized ability! This is a sanctified gift--genius; it is wise generalship that can make use of men according to their ability.",
