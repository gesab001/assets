    "word": "Why do those who profess to believe in Christ, who profess to keep the commandments, make such feeble efforts to answer the Saviour's prayer: Why do they seek to have their own way, instead of choosing the way and will of the Spirit of God?

The Lord has presented this to me in a most decided manner to present to His people.",
