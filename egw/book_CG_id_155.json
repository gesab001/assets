{"word": "Work in Partnership With the Divine.--Mothers, let your hearts be open to receive the instruction of God, ever bearing in mind the fact that you must act your part in conforming to the will of God. You must place yourself in the light and seek from God wisdom, that you may know how to act, that you may acknowledge God as the chief worker, and realize that you are a laborer together with Him. Let your heart be drawn out in contemplation of heavenly things. Exercise your God-given talents in doing the duties which God has enjoined upon you as a mother, and work in partnership with divine agencies. Labor intelligently, and, \"whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 68}
