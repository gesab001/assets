{"word": "Fond and indulgent parents, let me present for your instruction the directions given in the Bible for dealing with a rebellious son: \"If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them; then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. \n                                                                           205\nAnd all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "4T", "page": 204}
