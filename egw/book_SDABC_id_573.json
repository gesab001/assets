    "word": "In the days of ancient Israel, when at the foot of Sinai Moses told the people of the divine command, \"Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them,\" the response of the Israelites was accompanied by appropriate gifts. \"They came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing,\" and brought offerings. For the building of the sanctuary, great and expensive preparations were necessary; a large amount of the most precious and costly material was required; yet the Lord accepted only free-will offerings. \"Of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering\" was the divine command repeated by Moses to the congregation. Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice were the first requisites in preparing a dwelling-place for the Most High.",
