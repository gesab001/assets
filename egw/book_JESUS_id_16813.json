{"word": "When we are truly Christ's, our hearts will be full of meekness, gentleness, and kindness, because Jesus has forgiven our sins. As obedient children we shall receive and cherish the precepts He has given, and shall attend to the ordinances He has instituted.  We shall be seeking constantly to obtain a knowledge of Him. His example will be our rule of life. Those who are Christ's disciples will take the work where He left it and carry it forward in His name. They will copy the words, the spirit, the practices, of none but Him. Their eye is upon the Captain of their salvation. His will is their law. And as they advance, they catch more and clearer views of His countenance, of His character, of His glory. They do not cling to self, but hold fast His Word. . . . They reduce their knowledge of His will to practice. They hear and do the things that Jesus teaches. . . . Such are entitled to all the promises of His Word. Becoming one with Christ, they do the will of God, and exhibit the riches of His grace.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 163}
