{"word": "God's Purpose in Calamities \n\n     What mean the awful calamities by sea--vessels hurled into eternity without a moment's warning? \n                                                                           28\nWhat mean the accidents by land--fire consuming the riches that men have hoarded, much of which has been accumulated by oppression of the poor? The Lord will not interfere to protect the property of those who transgress His law, break His covenant, and trample upon His Sabbath, accepting in its place a spurious rest day.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 27}
