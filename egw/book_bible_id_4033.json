{"word": "All who take the word of God as their rule of life are brought into close relationship with one another. The Bible is their bond of union. But their companionship will not be sought or desired by those who do not bow to the Sacred Word as the one unerring guide. They will be at variance, both in faith and practice. There can be no harmony between them; they are unreconcilable. As Seventh-day Adventists we appeal from custom and tradition to the plain \"Thus saith the Lord;\" and for this reason we are not, and cannot be, in harmony with the multitudes who teach and follow the doctrines and commandments of men.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 389}
