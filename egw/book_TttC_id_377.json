The church was presented before me in vision. Said the angel to the church: \"Jesus speaks to thee, 'Be zealous and repent.'\" This work, I saw, should be taken hold of in earnest. There is something to repent of. Worldly-mindedness, selfishness, and covetousness have been eating out the spirituality and life of God's people.",
