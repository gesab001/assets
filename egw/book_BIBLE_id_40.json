{"word": "Make the Golden Rule the Law for the Family.-- The most valuable rules for social and family intercourse are to be found in the Bible. There is not only the best and purest standard of morality but the most valuable code of politeness. Our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount contains instruction of priceless worth to old and young. It should be often read in the family circle and its precious teachings exemplified in the daily life. The golden rule, \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,\" as well as the apostolic injunction, \"In honour preferring one another,\" should be made the law of the family. Those who cherish the spirit of Christ will manifest politeness at home, a spirit of benevolence even in little things. They will be constantly seeking to make all around them happy, forgetting self \n                                                                           424\nin their kind attentions to others. This is the fruit which grows upon the Christian tree.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AH", "page": 423}
