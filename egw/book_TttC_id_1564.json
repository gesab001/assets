    "word": "Some ministers at the very commencement of a series of meetings become very zealous, take on burdens which God does not require them to bear, exhaust their strength in singing and in long, loud praying and talking, and then are worn out and must go home to rest.

They rode upon the chariot of feeling, but there was not one victory gained against the enemy. His stronghold was not taken.",
