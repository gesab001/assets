{"word": "When Jesus asked Martha: \"Believest thou?\" she answered by a confession of her faith: \"Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.\"  Thus Martha declared her belief in the Messiahship of Jesus, and that He was able to perform any work which it pleased Him to do. Jesus bade Martha call her sister, and the friends that had come to comfort the afflicted women. When Mary came she fell at the feet of Jesus, also crying, \"Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.\"  At the sight of all this distress, Jesus \"groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, and said, Where have ye laid him?  They said unto him, Lord, come and see.\"  Together they all proceeded to the grave of Lazarus, which was a cave with a stone upon it.--2SP 362, 363 (1877).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 59}
