{"word": "\"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,\" even so was \"the Son of man . . . lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life\" (John 3:14, 15). If you are conscious of your sins, do not devote all your powers to mourning over them, but look and live. Jesus is our only Saviour; and although millions who need to be healed will reject His offered mercy, not one who trusts in His merits will be left to perish. While we realize our helpless condition without Christ, we must not be discouraged; we must rely upon a crucified and risen Saviour. Poor, sin-sick, discouraged soul, look and live. Jesus has pledged His word; He will save all who come unto Him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 37}
