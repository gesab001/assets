{"word": "Adam's Defeat--Christ's Victory \n\n     Adam and Eve fell through intemperate appetite. Christ came and withstood the fiercest temptation of Satan, and, in behalf of the race, overcame appetite, showing that man may overcome. As Adam fell through appetite, and lost blissful Eden, the children of Adam may, through Christ, overcome appetite, and through temperance in all things regain Eden.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 70}
