    "word": "\"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\" He that is faithful in his earthly possessions, which are least, making a judicious use of what God has lent him here, will be true to his profession. \"He that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\" He that will withhold from God that which He has lent him, will be unfaithful in the things of God in every respect. \"If therefore \n                                                                           199\nye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?\" If we prove unfaithful in the management of what God lends us here, He will never give us the immortal inheritance. \"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?\" Jesus has purchased redemption for us. It is ours; but we are placed here on probation to see if we will prove worthy of eternal life. God proves us by trusting us with earthly possessions. If we are faithful to impart freely of what He has lent us, to advance His cause, God can entrust to us the immortal inheritance. \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\" \"If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\"",
