{"word": "In our large churches very much might be done for the youth. Shall they have less special labor; shall fewer inducements be held out to them to become full-grown Christians--men and women in Christ Jesus--than were afforded them in the denominations which they have left for the truth's sake? Shall they be left to drift hither and thither, to become discouraged, and to fall into the temptations that are lurking everywhere to catch their unwary feet? If they err, and fall from the steadfastness of their integrity, do the members of the church who have neglected to care for the lambs, censure and blame them, and magnify their failures? Are their shortcomings talked of and exposed to others, and are they left in discouragement and despair?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 41}
