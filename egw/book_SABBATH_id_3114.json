An appointment was given out for the evening for me to speak at the hall upon the health question. Long before the hour, the hall was full to overflowing and a number stood in the street unable to get into the hall. We crowded our passage through. But fears were expressed that the floor might give way. Men who knew assured them there was not the least danger.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 398}
