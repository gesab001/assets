{"word": "Develop Church Talent\n \n\n     New Testament ministers were not to settle over one church.--The minister should develop the talent in the church, that meetings may be profitably kept up. Timothy was commanded to go from church to church, as one who should do this kind of work, and build up the churches in the most holy faith. He was to do the work of an evangelist, and this is an even more important work than that of the ministers. He was to preach the Word, but he was not to be settled over one church.--RH Sept. 28, 1897.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 263}
