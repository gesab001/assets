{"word": "I saw another field full of all kinds of flowers, and as I plucked them, I cried out, \"They will never fade.\" Next I saw a field of tall grass, most glorious to behold; it was living green and had a reflection of silver and gold, as it waved proudly to the glory of King Jesus. Then we entered a field full of all kinds of beasts\\97the lion, the lamb, the leopard, and the wolf, all together in perfect union. We passed through the midst of them, and they followed on peaceably after. Then we entered a wood, not like the dark woods we have here; no, no; but light, and all over glorious; the branches of the trees moved to and fro, and we all cried out, \"We will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.\" We passed through the woods, for we were on our way to Mount Zion.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 35}
