    "word": "But oh, when our noble Henry died, [THE DEATH OF HENRY N. WHITE OCCURRED AT TOPSHAM, MAINE, DECEMBER 8, 1863.] at the age of sixteen; when our sweet singer was borne to the grave, and we no more heard his early song, ours was a lonely home. Both parents and the two remaining sons felt the blow most keenly. But God comforted us in our bereavements, and with faith and courage we pressed forward in the work He had given us, in bright hope of meeting our children who had been torn from us by death, in that world where sickness and death will never come.",
