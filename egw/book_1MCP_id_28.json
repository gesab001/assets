{"word": "Surrounded With an Atmosphere of Peace.--All who are under the training of God need the quiet hour for communion with their own hearts, with nature, and with God.... We must individually hear Him speaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" . . . Amid the hurrying throngs and \n\n12 \n\nthe strain of life's intense activities he who is thus refreshed will be surrounded with an atmosphere of light and peace. He will receive a new endowment of both physical and mental strength.--MH 58 (1905).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 11}
