    "word": "An Appeal for Untiring Effort \n\n     The Lord calls upon His people to arouse out of sleep. The end of all things is at hand. When those who know the truth will be laborers together with God, the fruits of righteousness will appear. By the revelation of the love of God in missionary effort many will be awakened to see the sinfulness of their own course of action. They will see that in the past their selfishness has disqualified them from being laborers together with God. The exhibition of the love of God as seen in unselfish ministry to others will be the means of leading many souls to believe the word of God just as it reads.",
