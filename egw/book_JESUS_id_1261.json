{"word": "AT THE FIRST ADVENT OF CHRIST\n \n     THE LAST OF THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHETS WAS MALACHI. DURING THE PERIOD OF FORMALISM BEFORE THE APPEARANCE OF CHRIST, SO FAR AS ANY RECORD EXISTS, THERE WERE NO MANIFESTATIONS OF THE GIFT OF PROPHECY. BUT PROPHETS WERE SENT TO PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE MESSIAH. ZACHARIAS, THE FATHER OF JOHN THE BAPTIST, \"WAS\n240\nFILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, AND PROPHESIED.\" LUKE 1:67. SIMEON, A \"JUST AND DEVOUT\" MAN, WHO WAS \"WAITING FOR THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL,\" CAME BY THE SPIRIT INTO THE TEMPLE, AND PROPHESIED CONCERNING JESUS, THAT HE SHOULD BE A \"LIGHT TO LIGHTEN THE GENTILES, AND THE GLORY OF THY PEOPLE ISRAEL.\" ANNA, A PROPHETESS, \"SPAKE OF HIM TO ALL THEM THAT LOOKED FOR REDEMPTION IN JERUSALEM.\" LUKE 2:25, 32, 38. AND THERE WAS NO GREATER PROPHET IN ANY AGE THAN WAS JOHN THE BAPTIST, WHO WAS CHOSEN BY GOD TO PROCLAIM TO ISRAEL THE ADVENT OF \"THE LAMB OF GOD, WHICH TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD.\" JOHN 1:29.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 239}
