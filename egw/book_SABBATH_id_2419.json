{"word": "PAGE 355, \"THE REBELLION\"--AT THE TIME THAT THIS TESTIMONY WAS WRITTEN, EARLY IN 1863, SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS WERE FACED WITH A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THE NATION WAS AT WAR. ALTHOUGH AT HEART NONCOMBATANTS, THE SYMPATHIES OF THE CHURCH MEMBERS WERE, ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION, ENTIRELY WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY. AS THE CONFLICT PROGRESSED, MORE AND MORE MEN WERE CALLED TO THE ARMY. AT EACH CALL EVERY DISTRICT WAS UNDER OBLIGATION TO FURNISH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RECRUITS, AND WHEN THE VOLUNTARY ENLISTMENTS FELL BELOW THAT NUMBER, NAMES WERE DRAWN TO MAKE UP THE LACK. FOR A TIME IT WAS POSSIBLE BY THE PAYMENT OF MONEY TO BUY A SUBSTITUTE AND THUS RELEASE ONE WHOSE NAME HAD BEEN DRAWN. AS THERE WAS NO PROVISION MADE FOR ASSIGNING SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS TO NONCOMBATANT SERVICE, AND NO ALLOWANCE FOR SABBATH OBSERVANCE, SABBATHKEEPERS, WHEN DRAFTED, USUALLY IN THIS WAY PURCHASED THEIR EXEMPTION. IF THE INDIVIDUAL WAS UNABLE TO RAISE THE MONEY HIMSELF, HE WAS HELPED BY A FUND RAISED FOR THAT PURPOSE.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1T", "page": 716}
