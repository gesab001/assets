{"word": "Sunday is generally made a day of feasting and pleasure-seeking; but the Lord would have his people give the world a higher, holier example. Upon the Sabbath there should be a solemn dedication of the family to God. The commandment includes all within our gates; all the inmates of the house are to lay aside their worldly business, and employ the sacred hours in devotion. Let all unite to honor God by cheerful service upon his holy day.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 218}
