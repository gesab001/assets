    "word": "We do not understand as we should the great conflict going on between invisible agencies, the controversy between loyal and disloyal angels. Over every man, good and evil angels strive. This is no make-believe conflict. It is not mimic battles in which we are engaged. We have to meet most powerful adversaries, and it rests with us to determine which shall win. We are to find our strength where the early disciples found theirs. \"These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication.\" \"And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.\" \"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.\" Acts 1:14; 2:2, 4.",
