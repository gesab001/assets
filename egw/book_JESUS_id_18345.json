{"word": "Simple Lessons of Christ--In the name of Jesus Christ, I would appeal to the church who has been made the depository of deep and precious truths. God has given treasures to the church not to be hoarded, not to be buried in the earth, but to be imparted to others, that others may be enriched as well as ourselves. How shall we work? Let both laymen and ministers follow the example of Christ. Let them meet the people where they are. I would entreat you to labor in word and doctrine; do not get above the simplicity of the work. Do not soar away above the minds of the common people so that they cannot follow you, and if they did follow you, would neither be benefited nor blessed. Teach the simple lessons of Christ. Tell the touching story of His life of self-denial and sacrifice. Tell of His humiliation and death. Tell of His resurrection and ascension, of His intercession for them in the courts of God.
