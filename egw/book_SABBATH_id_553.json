{"word": "An Outstanding Experience in Australia.--On Sabbath, May 25, we had a precious meeting in the hall where our people meet at North Fitzroy. For several days before the meeting, I knew that I was expected to speak in the church on Sabbath; but unfortunately I had a severe cold and was quite hoarse. I felt inclined to excuse myself from this appointment; but as it was my only opportunity, I said, \"I will place myself before the people, and I believe the Lord will answer my earnest prayers, and remove the hoarseness so that I can present my message to the people.\" I presented to my heavenly Father the promise, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. . . . If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?\" Again, Christ says, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 244}
