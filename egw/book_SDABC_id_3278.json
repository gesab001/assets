    "word": "Christ's servants who are true and faithful may be unrecognized and unhonored by men . . . , but the Lord will honor them. They will not be forgotten by God. He will honor them by His presence because they have been found true and faithful. Those who have grown old in the cause and work of God have an experience of great value for the church. God honors His servants \n                                                                           955\nwho have grown old in His service. The most glorious truths concerning the last chapters of this earth's history were given to the aged disciple whom Jesus loved (MS 109, 1897).",
