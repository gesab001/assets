{"word": "A week before the opening of this Conference, Elder Matteson had begun a school for colporteurs and Bible workers. In the carrying on of this school he was joined by Elder A. B. Oyen, of Christiania, and Elder O. A. Olsen, just from America. Education was the watchword among the leaders in those days, and the people were eager to learn. The workers' institute was opened each morning at 6:30 with a prayer and social meeting. At 9 o'clock there was a class in bookkeeping; at 11:30 instruction was given in home missionary work. Instruction on the holding of Bible readings was given at 4 o'clock in the afternoon; and at 8 P.M. there was a preaching service. Every hour of the day was counted as precious by both teachers and students.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 297}
