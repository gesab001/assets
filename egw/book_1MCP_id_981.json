{"word": "\"They married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all\" (verse 27). We see the same manifestation now in regard to marriage. Youth, and even men and women who ought to be wise and discerning, act as if bewitched upon this question. A satanic power seems to take possession of them. The most indiscreet marriages are formed. God is not consulted.
