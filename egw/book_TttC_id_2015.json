    "word": "Many look upon the great work to be accomplished for God's people, and their prayers go up to Him for help in the great harvest. But, if help does not come in just the manner they expect, they will not receive it, but turn from it as the Jewish nation turned from Christ because disappointed in the manner of His appearing. Too much poverty and humility marked His advent, and in their pride they refused Him who came to give them life. In this God would have the church humble their hearts and see the great need of correcting their ways before Him, lest He visit them in judgment. Many who profess godliness make the external adorning far more important than the inward adorning. Had the church all humbled themselves before the Lord and corrected their past errors so fully as to meet His mind, they would not be so deficient in estimating moral excellence of character.",
