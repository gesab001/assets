{"word": "Be Exceedingly Careful \n\n     It would be surprising if there were not some, who, not being well-balanced in mind, have spoken and acted  indiscreetly; for whenever and wherever the Lord works in  giving a genuine blessing, a counterfeit is also revealed, in order to make of none effect the true work of God. Therefore we need to be exceedingly careful, and walk humbly before God, that we may have spiritual eyesalve that we may distinguish the working of the Holy Spirit of God from the working of that spirit that would bring in wild license and fanaticism. \"By their fruits ye shall know them\" (Matthew 7:20). Those who are really beholding Christ will be changed into His image, even by the Spirit of the Lord, and will grow up to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit of God will inspire men with love and purity; and refinement will be manifest in their characters.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 142}
