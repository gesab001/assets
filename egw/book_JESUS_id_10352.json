{"word": "The door of the heart must be opened to the Holy Spirit, for this is the sanctifier, and the truth is the medium. There must be an acceptance of the truth as it is in Jesus. This is the only genuine sanctification: \"Thy word is truth.\" Oh, read the prayer of Christ for unity, \"Keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are.\" The prayer of Christ is not only for those who are now His disciples, but for all those who shall believe on Christ through the words of His disciples, even to the end of the world. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 199}
