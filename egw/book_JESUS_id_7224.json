{"word": "The life of Christ had been so secluded at Nazareth that the world did not know Him as the Son of God--their Redeemer. He was regarded as nothing more than the son of Joseph and Mary. His life in childhood and youth was remarkable. His silence in regard to His exalted character and mission contains an instructive lesson to all youth. His faithful obedience to His parents until He was thirty years of age is a pattern for youth to imitate more than the Jesus in Gethsemane and upon Calvary.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 33}
