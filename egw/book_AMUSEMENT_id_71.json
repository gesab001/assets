{"word": "Chap. Fifteen - Care in Handling Property\n\n     Repress Destructive Tendencies.--Education must be all-round and uniform. Every mother needs to be diligent. She must allow nothing to divert her mind. She must not allow her children to follow their uneducated will in handling things in the home. They should be taught that they are not to keep the house in perpetual disorder by handling things for their own amusement. Mothers, teach your children from their earliest years that they are not to look upon everything in the home as playthings for them. By these little things order is taught. No matter what fuss the children may make, let not the organ of destruction, which is large in babyhood and childhood, be strengthened and cultivated. \"Thou shalt,\" and \"Thou shalt not,\" God says. Without loss of temper, but decidedly, parents are to say to their children, No, and mean it.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 101}
