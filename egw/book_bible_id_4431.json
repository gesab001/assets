It will not do to rely upon them. Truth, Bible truth, you and I want at any cost. Like the noble Bereans, we want to search the Scriptures daily, with earnest prayer, to know what is truth, and then obey the truth at any cost to ourselves, without reference to the great men or good men.--Letter 35, Nov. 6, 1877, to Caroline Clough, a non-Adventist relative.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 319}
