{"word": "All in the Name of the Lord Jesus. One about to marry a wife should stop to consider candidly why he takes this step.

Will he venture to give loose rein to his passions and see how much care and taxation he can subject his wife to without extinguishing life, or will he study the meaning of the words, \"Whatsoever ye do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus\"?--Ms 152, 1899.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TSB", "page": 15}
