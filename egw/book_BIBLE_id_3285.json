{"word": "7, 8. Secret of Joshua's Success.--The Lord has a great work to be done in our world. To every man He has given His work for man to do. But man is not to make man his guide, lest he be led astray; this is always unsafe.

He made God his Guide (Letter 188, 1901).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2BC", "page": 993}
