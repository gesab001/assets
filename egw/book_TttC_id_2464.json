    "word": "Sanctification of heart and life is alone acceptable with God. Said the angel, as he pointed to the ministers who are not right: \"Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.\" \"Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\" God calls for integrity of soul; for truth in the inward parts, transforming the entire man by the renewing of the mind through the influences of the divine Spirit. Not all the ministers are devoted to the work; not all have put their hearts into it. They move as listlessly as though a temporal millennium were allowed them in which to work for souls. They shun burdens and responsibilities, care and privations. Self-denial, suffering, and weariness are not pleasant nor convenient. It is the study of some to save themselves from wearing labor. They study their own convenience and how to please themselves, their wives, and their children; and the work upon which they have entered is nearly lost sight of.",
