It must be given to those who claim to be in the highways of Christian experience--to the members of the different churches. \"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\" Revelation 2:7. In these churches there are true worshipers and there are false worshipers.

We must bring the warning before professed Christians who are transgressors \n                                                                           77\nof the law of God. To them the message must be given.",
