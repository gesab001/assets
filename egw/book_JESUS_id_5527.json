{"word": "We should be cheerful; for there is nothing gloomy in the religion of Jesus. While all lightness, trifling, and jesting, which the apostle says are not convenient, are to be studiously avoided, there is sweet rest and peace in Jesus, that will be expressed in the countenance. Christians will not be mournful, depressed, despairing. They will be sober-minded; yet they will show to the world a cheerfulness which only grace can impart.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 417}
