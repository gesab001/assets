Much may be done to restore the moral image of God in man, to improve the physical, mental, and moral capabilities.

Ye are accepted in the Beloved. The Lord shows, to the repenting, believing one, that Christ accepts the surrender of the soul, to be molded and fashioned after His own likeness.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 32}
