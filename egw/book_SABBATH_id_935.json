{"word": "It is impossible to describe the horror and despair of those who have trampled upon God's holy requirements. The Lord gave them his law; they might have compared their characters with it, and learned their defects while there was yet opportunity for repentance and reform; but in order to secure the favor of the world, they set aside its precepts and taught others to transgress. They have endeavored to compel God's people to profane his Sabbath. Now they are condemned by that law which they have despised. With awful distinctness they see that they are without \n640\nexcuse. They chose whom they would serve and worship. \\93Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.\\94 [Malachi 3:18.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 639}
