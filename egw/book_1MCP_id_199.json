{"word": "Christ's Work Is to Heal the Brokenhearted.-- God's healing power runs all through nature. If a tree is cut, if a human being is wounded or breaks a bone, nature begins at once to repair the injury. Even before the need exists, the healing agencies are in readiness; and as soon as a part is wounded, every energy is bent to the work of restoration. So it is in the spiritual realm. Before sin created the need, God had provided the remedy. Every soul that yields to temptation is wounded, bruised, by the adversary; but wherever there is sin, there is the \n\n66 \n\nSaviour. It is Christ's work \"to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, . . . to set at liberty them that are bruised\" (Luke 4:18).--Ed 113 (1903).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 65}
