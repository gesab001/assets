{"word": "They now decided to demand no sign of his authority for his bold action regarding the temple, but to confront him with questions and charges calculated to draw out some admissions or declarations by which they might condemn him. After carefully arranging their plan they repaired to the temple where Jesus was preaching the gospel to the people, and proceeded to question him as to what authority he had for his acts \n                                                                           29\nin the temple. They expected him to reply that God had invested him with the authority which he had there manifested. This assertion they were prepared to deny. But instead of this Jesus met them with a question apparently pertaining to another subject: \"The baptism of John, was it from Heaven, or of men?\" His questioners were at a loss how to reply. If they should deny the mission of John and his baptism unto repentance, they would lose influence with the people--for John was acknowledged by them to be a prophet of God. But if they should acknowledge that John's mission was divine, then they would be obliged to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah; for John had repeatedly pointed him out to the people as the Christ, saying, \"Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world.\" John had spoken of Jesus as one whose shoe-latchet he was not worthy to unloose.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 28}
