{"word": "Be a Conqueror Through Jesus.--Do not take your sorrows and difficulties to man. Present yourself to Him who is able to do \"exceeding abundantly.\" He knows just how to help you. Do not turn from the loving, compassionate Redeemer to human friends, who, though they may give you the best they have, may lead you into wrong paths. Take all your troubles to Jesus.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 83}
