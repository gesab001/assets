{"word": "Be careful, my brother, . . . in regard to where your faith is tending. Jesus lives to make intercession for you. Let your mind be one with the mind of Christ. Having His mind, you will not soar to heights which will at last bring you down to the lowest depths. Dabble not in those things which now appear to you so attractive, but which do not lead to Christ. Let your ambition ascend higher, to pure, true fellowship with Him in whom you may safely glory. Then your religion will be a power for good. You will not then communicate that which will prove a snare unto death.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 112}
