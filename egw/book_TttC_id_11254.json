    "word": "God finally sent His Son to reveal to men the character of the Unseen. Christ came and lived on this earth a life of obedience to God's law. He gave His precious life to save the world and made His servants His stewards. With the gift of Christ all the treasures of heaven were given to man. The church was freighted with the food of heaven for starving souls. This was the treasure that the people of God were commissioned to carry to the world. They were faithfully to perform their duty, continuing their work until the message of mercy had encircled the world.",
