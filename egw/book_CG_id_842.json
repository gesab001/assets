{"word": "Chap. Fifty-One - Preparing for School\n\n     The First Eight or Ten Years.--Children should not be long confined within doors, nor should they be required to apply themselves closely to study until a good foundation has been laid for physical development. For the first eight or ten years of a child's life the field or garden is the best schoolroom, the mother the best teacher, nature the best lesson book. Even when the child is old enough to attend school, his health should be regarded as of greater importance than a knowledge of books. He should be surrounded with the conditions most favorable to both physical and mental growth.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 300}
