{"word": "The attribute that Christ appreciates most in man is charity (love) out of a pure heart. This is the fruit borne upon the Christian tree. \"Every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God\" (1 John 4:7). The Lord Jesus has said, \"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another\" (John 13:34, 35).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 365}
