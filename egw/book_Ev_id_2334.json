{"word": "Taste, Color, and Fit.--Some who minister in sacred things so arrange their dress upon their persons, that, to some extent at least, it destroys the influence of their labor. There is an apparent lack of taste in color and neatness of fit. What is the impression given by such a manner of dress? It is, that the work in which they are engaged is considered no more sacred or elevated than common labor, as plowing in the field. The minister, by his example, brings down sacred things upon a level with common things.--Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 614.
