{"word": "Considering Pastors of Other Denominations.--It should ever be manifest that we are reformers, but not bigots. When our laborers enter a new field, they should seek to become acquainted with the pastors of the several churches in the place. [SEE ALSO PP. 562-564, \"MINISTERS OF OTHER DENOMINATIONS.\"] Much has been lost by neglecting to do this. If our ministers show themselves friendly and sociable, and do not act as if they were ashamed of the message they bear, it will have an excellent effect, and may give these pastors and their congregations favorable impressions of the truth. At any rate, it is right to give them a chance to be kind and favorable if they will.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 143}
