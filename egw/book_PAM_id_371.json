{"word": "Spend less time in preaching and more time in studying how to teach others to work.--Our ministers must become educators as well as preachers. They should teach the people not to depend upon them, but upon Christ. The minister who preaches two hours when he should not exceed one, would far better serve the cause of God by devoting that extra hour to earnest, careful thought in studying how to direct others, how to teach them to work.--ST May 17, 1883.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 156}
