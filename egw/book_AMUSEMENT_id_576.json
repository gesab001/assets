{"word": "4. A Cause of Accidents \n\n     The Drinker Under Satan's Control.--Men who use liquor make themselves the slaves of Satan. Satan tempts those who occupy positions of trust on railways, on steamships, those who have charge of the boats or cars laden with people flocking to idolatrous amusement, to indulge perverted appetite, and thus forget God and His laws.

Then he works to destroy the pleasure lovers.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 34}
