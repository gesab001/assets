{"word": "Prophecy not only foretells the manner and object of Christ's coming, but presents tokens by which men are to know when it is near. Said Jesus: \\93There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars.\\94 [Luke 21:25.] \\93The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.\\94 [Mark 13:24-26.] The Revelator thus describes the first of the signs to precede the second advent: \\93There was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon become as blood.\\94 [Revelation 6:12.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 304}
