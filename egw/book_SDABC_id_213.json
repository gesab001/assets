    "word": "16 (Galatians 6:7). Flippant Speech May Be False Witness.--Slander covers more ground than we suppose. The command, \"Thou shalt not bear false witness,\" means very much more than we realize. False witness is borne again and again in flippant speech concerning even the workers whom God has sent. The seeds of envy, of evil thinking and evil speaking, germinate and produce a harvest of their kind, to be garnered by the one who planted the seed. \"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\" (Letter 9, 1892).",
