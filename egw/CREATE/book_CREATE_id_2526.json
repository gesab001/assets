    "word": "John writes: [Revelation 18:1-5, quoted]. \n     Satan will so mingle his deceptions with truth that side issues will be created to turn the attention of the people from the great issue, the test to be brought upon the people of God in these last days. From the light that God has given me, I know that the gospel message for this time is being turned aside for work among the lowest class of people. This work is being made the all-absorbing work for this time, but God does not make it thus. But it is a never-ending work, and if it is carried on as it has been in the past, all the powers of God's people will be required to balance it, and the work of preparing a people to stand amid the perils of the last days will never be done.",
