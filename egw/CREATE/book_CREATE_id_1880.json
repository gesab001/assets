    "word": "Unconsecrated minds will place hindrances in the way of God's work, as they have done in the past. But do not stop to enter into controversy and create disagreeable issues. If hindered in one way, be ready to honor God by working in a way that is open. In due time obstacles that now seem insurmountable will be removed. God can remove obstructions in ways most unexpected when He sees that by doing this He can best glorify His name. . . .",
