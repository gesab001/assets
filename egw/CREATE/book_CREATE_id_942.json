    "word": "No Strife in Heaven.--Let no one feel, even though he may theoretically be established in the present truth, that he makes no mistakes. But if mistakes are made, let there be a readiness to correct them. And let us avoid everything that is likely to create dissension and strife; for there is a heaven before us, and among its inhabitants there will be no strife.--RH, Aug 8, 1907. (CH 244.) \n\n504",
