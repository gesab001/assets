    "word": "This church has been raised up as the result of the Ashfield camp meeting. A neat little church was erected, \n\n\n                                     -297- \n\nvery nicely planned and tastefully arranged, but a debt of two hundred pounds was left upon the church. Since that time a second camp meeting has been held in Stanmore. Great interest has been created and extended into other suburbs close by. The elder son who ought to rejoice that the Lord is bringing the wandering sheep to the fold now felt envious and jealous because more labor could not be given to them. The Lord is now waking them up and several have been baptized again, and yet there are a few poor souls who are in some way influenced by Elder McCullagh who keeps up communications with them. He continues sowing his tares, and they in their turn resow them in other hearts.",
