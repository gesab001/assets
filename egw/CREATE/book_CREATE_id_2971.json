WHITE IN RESPONSE TO THE PROPOSAL THAT SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST WOMEN, IN THEIR ATTIRE, RETURN TO THE \"REFORM DRESS\" ADVOCATED IN THE SIXTIES.] \n\n     In answer to the questions that have recently come to me in regard to resuming the reform dress, I would say that those who have been agitating this subject may be assured that they have not been inspired by the Spirit of God. The Lord has not indicated that it is the duty of our sisters to go back to the reform dress. The difficulties that we once had to meet are not to be brought in again. There must be no branching out now into singular forms of dress. New and strange things will continually arise, to lead God's people into false excitement, religious revivals, and curious developments; but our people should not be subjected to any tests of human invention that will create controversy in any line.",
