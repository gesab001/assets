    "word": "What does it amount to? If you have the Spirit of Christ you will love every soul for whom Christ died. Not with a love-sick sentimentalism. Not with base affection. Nothing like that. You will love as Christ loved. You will want to carry that burden for souls, oh how carefully, that there shall not be any occasion given to the youth, or to those of mature age, that shall bring in or make occasion of their stumbling or being turned out of the way, or a channel for an impure thought. Create an atmosphere where the soul can be kept open and clean before God our Maker.",
