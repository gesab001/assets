    "word": "Physicians should not suppose that it is right for them to make appointments or to travel on the Sabbath. Not only by precept but also by example they should honor the true Sabbath, which is to be immortalized as the evidence that God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, placing the command concerning it in the very bosom of the decalogue. It is to be sacredly observed.",
