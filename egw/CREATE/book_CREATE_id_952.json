    "word": "Overt Sin Manifests Latent Thoughts.--The season of temptation, under which, it may be, one falls into grievous sin, does not create the evil that is revealed but only develops or makes manifest that which was hidden and latent in the heart. As a man \"thinketh in his heart, so is he\"; for out of the heart \"are the issues of life\" (Proverbs 23:7; 4:23).--MB 60 (1896). \n\n658",
