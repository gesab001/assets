THESE WERE TO BROTHER DUNLAP (LETTER 3A, 1890) \n          AND BROTHER HUTCHINGS (LETTER 13a, 1890).] \n\n\n     I have had more sleep than I feared I should get when I lay down. My ear was poulticed, yet I see no special change for the better. Brother Emery Farnsworth brought his horse and phaeton and took Sara and me to Clinton and I visited a dentist to see if my teeth created any of this difficulty. He examined my teeth and said that they did not need any repairing. I am asking the Lord to help me, to remove the pain, and strengthen me to do the work before me. I know I have a message for the people. \n\n\n                                 -16-",
