    "word": "Encouragement has often been given him,--a word here and a word there,--to show him a way of escape from his peril. He has been represented as one who is slipping over a precipice, and the hand of Christ is the only one outstretched to save. Notwithstanding these plain warnings of danger, he sees not his peril. He does not realize his condition. But God knows all things; He is infinite in knowledge and in all wisdom concerning the real condition of every man. Our thoughts are open before Him. And as God knows all things, He knows the mind of every man that He has created. We are the work of His own mind, through Christ Jesus.",
