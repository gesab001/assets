    "word": "Brother Nelson who is in the office, cannot be regarded as in exactly the same position as these men; but he needs a different mold of character. He has not that kind, Christian courtesy that will have a saving, fragrant influence upon the minds of those who associate with him or do business with him. Though he may hold to right principles, his manner of representing these principles is such as to make a disagreeable impression upon the minds of those associated with him. His words, his manner of expression, creates thoughts and feelings that are very objectionable. A good man is to manifest his principles, but he can do this in a way that will not make such a disagreeable impression upon those with whom he does business. God requires Brother Nelson to learn his lessons more perfectly in the school of Christ. His principles should be kept more vividly before his own mind, that they may bring forth in him the peaceable fruits of righteousness. His unfortunate manner of expression, and his spirit of criticism, destroy his influence, that, if sanctified, might be of real value.",
