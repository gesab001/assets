    "word": "Men do not understand how serious are the issues connected with their relation to God's cause. When men do things crookedly, the Lord calls upon them to make them straight. My brethren, keep straight ahead. If you neglect your own work to criticize and condemn the work given someone else, much time and effort will be required to recover what you have lost. Thus trials are created that need never exist. We are simply to follow our leader. To turn from the pathway of duty brings trial. No one can leave his place without suffering the ensuing confusion.",
