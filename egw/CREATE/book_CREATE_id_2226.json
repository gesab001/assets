    "word": "Now, just now, is the time when the perils of the last days are thickening around us, that we need wise men for counsellors, not men who will feel it duty to stir up and create disorder, and who cannot possibly give wise counsel, but who can organize and arrange that every stirring up shall bring order out of confusion, and rest and peace in obeying the word of the Lord. Let every man be found in his true place, ready to do some work for the Master, according to his several ability. None should be left to drift, to make a vast amount of trouble and confusion that is difficult to arrange and keep in order. How shall this great work be done? \"Take my yoke upon you,\" saith Jesus Christ, who hath bought you with his own precious blood, whose servants and property you are, \"and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" If every one will come to Jesus in a teachable spirit, with contrition of heart, then he is in a condition of mind to be instructed and to learn of Jesus, and obey his orders.",
