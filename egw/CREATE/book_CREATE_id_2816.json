    "word": "Cannot men who have the history of the fall, the workings of the wily foe since Adam's day see how the same principles are still at work, and what will be the end thereof?

Infinite wisdom is revealed in Christ, and he suffered in our stead, that men should have another test and trial, \n                                                                           1428\nto prove whether they would be safe subjects of his kingdom. Christ has risen from the dead and ascended on high to intercede for the fallen race. This is now his work before the throne of God. He would have men to love God supremely, and their fellow-men impartially. It is his purpose that we should be closely attached to God, and tenderly attached to one another.",
