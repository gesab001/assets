    "word": "There is another subject which I wish to mention to you. It is the matter of royalties on books. W. C. W. has received letters since he returned from America, from A. R. Henry of a very decided character on this point. W. C. W. has stated the positions taken by your board in B. C. I am very sorry that they are not far seeing in judgment. They evidence that they are narrow in their views and comprehension. They will arouse much unpleasantness of feeling in the bookmakers, and will not accomplish that which they have undertaken. This movement will create a want of harmony. God will not sanction any such means as they have in view, because they are not just. Here is the danger of depending on unsanctified men to make decisions.",
