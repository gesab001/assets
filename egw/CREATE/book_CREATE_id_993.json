    "word": "All the heavenly beings are in constant activity, and the Lord Jesus, in His lifework, has given an example for every one. He went about \"doing good.\" God has established the law of obedient action. Silent but ceaseless, the objects of His creation do their appointed work. The ocean is in constant motion. The springing grass, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, does its errand, clothing the fields with beauty. The leaves are stirred to motion, and yet no hand is seen to touch them. The sun, moon, and stars are useful and glorious in fulfilling their mission. . . . And man, his mind and body created in God's own similitude, must be active in order to fill his appointed place.",
