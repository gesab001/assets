    "word": "As Paul beheld Christ in His power, he broke out into exclamations of admiration and amazement: \"Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.\" \"By him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him, and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist\" . . . (Signs of the Times, Apr. 4, 1906). \n                                                                           35",
