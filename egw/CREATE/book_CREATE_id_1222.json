    "word": "Christ came to the earth, taking humanity and standing as man's representative, to show in the controversy with Satan that man, as God created him, connected with the Father and the Son, could obey every divine requirement. Speaking through His servant He declares, \"His commandments are not grievous\" (1 John 5:3). It was sin \n                                                                           254\nthat separated man from his God, and it is sin that maintains this separation.",
