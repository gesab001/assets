    "word": "We must not be careless and negligent in exercising faith, in maintaining a principle to be in the assembly of the saints, and be the Lord's witnesses, and have a testimony to bear that is uplifting, full of courage and hope and victory. Ask at every step, Is this the way of the Lord? You can shape your business so that it shall not become all-absorbing and you grow away from Jesus and lose sight of His attractive loveliness. Darkness and want of faith create a sickly religion, a waning piety, and in no case can you represent Jesus Christ in your character.",
