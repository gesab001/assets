    "word": "Brother _____ should be guarded that he does not take himself from the work to serve tables. He has too often bound upon himself burdens which prevented his putting his energies into the work. He should consecrate his powers and abilities to God, to save perishing souls. In the past it has sometimes been the case that Brother _____ has not clung to an interest with such perseverance and zeal as would enable him to bind off his work completely and thoroughly, so that he could present every man perfect in Christ. He should devote less time and thought to temporal things, and more study and earnestness to eternal things. If the enemy can create things to draw you away from your work, he will be diligent to do it. But if he sees he cannot obtain this power over you, he will abandon his object. As an interest is about to close up, be careful not to ripen it off abruptly. Keep the confidence of the people, if possible, that the souls who are in the valley of decision may find the true path, and walk in the way to life.",
