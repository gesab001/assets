    "word": "The Lord Jesus would have the true philosophy of nature's great lesson book opened before the mind.... We need workers who will gain breadth of mind by studying the book God has opened before us of His created works. Angels cooperate with those who proclaim the truths represented by the things of nature. These things are not God, but they are specimens of God's handiwork.--Letter 223, June 2, 1905, to J. A. Burden.",
