    "word": "The truth may be advanced by works of charity, by helping the ignorant, the sick, the hungry, and the helpless. But our work is not to be confined to the outcasts. The highways as well as the byways are to be thoroughly worked. A far greater work might have been accomplished if counterworking influences had not created contention and strife. Let the churches be purged from their selfishness and their pride, and gain an experience of uniting with one another to encourage the hearts of the doubting and to recover those who have entered the mist and fog of unbelief.",
