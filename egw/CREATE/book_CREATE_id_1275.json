    "word": "On Making the Dress Question a Test \n\n     Your letter has been received and read. . . . The subject that you place before me for counsel [the proposal to return to the reform dress advocated and worn in the late 1860's] is one that needs to be carefully considered. Our sisters whose minds are agitated upon the subject of again resuming the reform dress, should be prayerfully cautious in every move they make. We have now the most solemn, important tests given to us from the Word of God for this special period of time. This test is for the whole world. The Lord does not require that any tests of human inventions shall be brought in to divert the minds of the people or create controversy in any line.",
