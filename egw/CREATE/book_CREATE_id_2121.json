    "word": "\"No moral wrong.\" This has been the excuse made by every one reproved for similar conduct. What is moral wrong? Have your spiritual senses become so blinded that you can not discern the truth? Do you not know that grapevines will not bear thorns, nor a bramble bush grapes? If the truth is brought into the inner sanctuary of the soul, it will create a pure moral taste. Then all these objectionable, demoralizing practices will be seen to be a positive denial of Christ, a sin which will pollute the soul. . . . All trifling, jesting, joking, and flattery spoken to young girls or women, boys or men, are thorn berries, and that which produces them is a thorn bush, for the tree is known by its fruits.",
