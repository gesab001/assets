    "word": "Let there be no tests manufactured now to absorb time and minds to bring in new reforms. We have now to face tremendous issues, and all the time and power of our thought are to be called to the living issues before us.

See if you cannot by a consistent, harmonious, all-round character, [and] by the presentations of truth to individuals who are out of Christ, save some souls from ruin.",
