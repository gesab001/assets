    "word": "Some tattle and criticize, finding fault with everything, when they might easily find something to approve. Their words might encourage; they might leave a sweet, fragrant influence behind them; but is otherwise. Their words create strife and disaffection, and evil angels are close beside them. These are the ones who think they see something that they must reprove, but do not try to see that which is worthy of commendation. If they would commend where it is just and right to commend, they would give strength to righteous purposes and principles.",
