    "word": "The less condiments and desserts are placed on our tables the better it will be for all who partake of the food. All mixed and complicated foods are injurious to the health of human beings. Dumb animals would \n\n\n                                   -47- \n\nnever eat such a mixture as is placed in the human stomach. Hot bread and biscuit, fresh from the oven, is not healthful. The heated gases need to be evaporated. Hot soda biscuits are often spread with butter and eaten as a choice diet. But the enfeebled digestion can not but feel the abuse placed upon it. Unhealthful habits of eating are killing their thousands and ten thousands. Food should be thoroughly cooked, nicely prepared, and appetizing. My brother, after all the light that has been given on the diet question, your lamentations because you can not exercise freedom in meat-eating is apparently similar to the complaining lamentations and weeping children of Israel in the ears of the Lord. I tell you that from the light the Lord has been pleased to give me there is a continual taxing of the human stomach with a wrong quality of food, also with too large a quantity. The stomach is overloaded and worn out when it should be capable of performing good work. The amount of cooking done is not at all necessary, neither should there be any poverty-stricken diet, either in quality or quantity, but the richness of the food and complicated mixtures are destroying. Highly seasoned meats, followed by rich pastry, is wearing out the vital organs of digestion of children. Were they accustomed to plain, wholesome food, their appetites would not crave unnatural luxuries and mixed preparations. Education, habit, and custom make it difficult to reconstruct the family arrangements. Meat given to children is not the best thing to insure success. Make fruit the article of diet to be placed upon your table which shall constitute the bill of fare. The pieces of fruit mingled with the bread will be highly enjoyed. Good, ripe, undecayed fruit is the thing we should thank God for because it is beneficial to the health. Try it. To educate your children to subsist upon a meat diet would be hurtful to them. It is much easier to create an unnatural appetite than to correct and reform the taste after it has become second nature.",
