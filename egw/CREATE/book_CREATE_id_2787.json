    "word": "Monday, December 29, 1890 \n\n     I had a suffering night and left Washington at eleven o'clock a.m. We took the sleeper. Paid for only one berth, three dollars and a half. Sarah would not pay for an extra berth and rode in day coach and saved the three dollars and half. We tried to get a cup of hot drink, as there was a dining car attached to the train, but they said they had not any, so we ate our home lunch and relished it. They did not seem pleased because we did not patronize the dining car, but in all my travels I do not create expense by visiting restaurants, or patronizing dining cars. We carry our simple lunch and are perfectly satisfied. I have eaten only twice in the dining car in all my journeyings and I feel it my duty bind about expenses and not make the conference pay large bills for me to gratify my appetite. Our simple lunch of dry bread suffices me. \n                                                                           786",
