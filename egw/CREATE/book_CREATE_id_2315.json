    "word": "MR No. 199 -  On the Law in Galatians; On Sister White's Daughters; Letter to a Schoolgirl; Eternal Truth\n\nMiscellaneous Items\n\nOn the Law in Galatians\n\n     We are in danger of falling into similar errors. Quibbling over unimportant matters.  Never should that which God has not given as a test be carried as was the subject of the law in Galatians. . . . I have been instructed that the terrible experience at the Minneapolis Conference is one of the saddest chapters in the history of the believers in present truth. God forbids that the subject of the two laws should ever again be agitated as it then was. Some are not yet healed of their defection and would plunge into this subject once more. Should they do this, differences of opinion would again create division. This question must not be revived.--Letter 179, 1902, p. 10. (To Elder C.P. Bollman, Nov. 19, 1902.)",
