    "word": "4: The Origin of Evil\n\nThe Origin of Evil a Mystery\n     The angels had been created full of goodness and love. They loved one another impartially and their God supremely, and they were prompted by this love to do His pleasure. The law of God was not a grievous yoke to them, but it was their delight to do His commandments, to hearken unto the voice of His Word. But in this state of peace and purity, sin originated with him who had been perfect in all his ways. The prophet writes of him: \u201cThine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.\u201d Sin is a mysterious, unexplainable thing. There was no reason for its existence; to seek to explain it is to seek to give a reason for it, and that would be to justify it. Sin appeared in a perfect universe, a thing that was shown to be inexcusable.\u2014ST April 28, 1890.",
