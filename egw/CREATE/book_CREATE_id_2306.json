    "word": "In the law of the kingdom of the God who rules the sinless inhabitants of heaven are to be found the principles that should lie at the foundation of the laws of earthly governments. The laws of these governments should be in harmony with the law of Jehovah, the standard by which all created beings are to be judged. No man should be forced to act in harmony with human laws that are in direct opposition to the law that God has given.--Letter 187, 1903, p. 5. (To Elder W. C. White, Aug. 17, 1903.)",
