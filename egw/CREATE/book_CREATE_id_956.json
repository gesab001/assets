    "word": "Appreciation of Science Vitalized by God's Spirit.-- Knowledge is power, but it is a power for good only when united with true piety. It must be vitalized by the Spirit of God in order to serve the noblest purposes. The closer our connection with God, the more fully can we comprehend the value of true science; for the attributes of God, as seen in His created works, can be best appreciated by him who was a knowledge of the Creator of all things, the Author of all truth. Such can make the highest use of \n\n744 \n\nknowledge, for when brought under the full control of the Spirit of God, their talents are rendered useful to the fullest extent.--CT 38 (1913).",
