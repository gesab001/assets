    "word": "Origin of Sin \n\n     Man cannot change one attribute of his diseased character. Man aspired to be as God, and from that fatal moment the originator of evil began to alienate him from God. Satan is an author of all envy, all jealousy, all deception, and all strife. He erected the traitor's ensign of revolt upon this earth. He manifested his apostasy by his insane effort to create an empire governed by himself. He is the author of every sin which has cursed the earth.--Letter 20, 1901, p. 8. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, January 28, 1901.)",
