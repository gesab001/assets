    "word": "MR No. 1401 - Sacredness of the Law and the Sabbath; The Need for Obedience and Reformation\n\n     (Written February 25, 1900, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, \"To Dear Brother and Sister Hickox.\") \n\n\n     We feel deeply interested in the work in Maitland. We know that the enemy will create as many false theories as possible to divert minds in this important time, the period of decision. I would be glad if I could spend more time in Maitland, but next Sabbath will be my last opportunity to be there for some time; for a week from next Wednesday or Thursday I leave for Geelong, to attend the camp meeting there. From there I may go to Tasmania, and if so, I shall not be able to be with you for some time.",
