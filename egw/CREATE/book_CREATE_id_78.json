    "word": "Did Christ die to let loose the whole of humanity to worship idols instead of God, when the commandment said, \u201cThou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve\u201d? And \u201cthe Lord made heaven and earth,\u201d and what then? \u201cAnd rested the seventh day\u201d and \u201csanctified it,\u201d and gave it to you to observe as God\u2019s memorial\u2014a memorial that He is the living God who created the heavens overhead and the earth upon which we stand. He made the lofty trees and put the covering upon every flower. He gave to each one its tints, and the Lord of heaven made human beings and gave them the Sabbath. What for? For all the posterity of Adam; it was a gift to all his posterity. If they had always obeyed the fourth commandment there never would have been an infidel in the world, because it testified that \u201cthe Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is.\u201d. . .",
