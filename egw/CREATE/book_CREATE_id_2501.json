    "word": "Selfishness, self-love, wicked, unkind actions, create an unwholesome atmosphere about the soul and steel the heart to all good. Children who are in this condition hear not the whispers of affection, for avarice has eaten out the good in the heart, and they deny their parents the favors which they could bestow upon them. How bitter will be the close of life to such children! They cannot have happy reflections when they themselves need sympathy and love. They will better appreciate what they should have done \n\n\n                                  -86- \n\nfor their parents. They will then remember that they had the privilege of smoothing the pathway of their parents to the grave, so that they might have departed in comfort and peace. If they had denied them this comfort in the time of their helpless need, the memory of it will weigh like a millstone upon the heart. Remorse will eat into the soul. Their days will be filled with regret. The love we owe our parents is not to be measured by years, and is never to be forgotten. Our obligation lasts while they and we live.",
