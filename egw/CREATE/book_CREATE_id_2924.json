    "word": "In the face of the most trying circumstances, a good beginning has been made in this needy field. The Lord now calls upon us to come up to His help. Again and again He has placed before our people the needs of the work among the colored race, but there are many who have done very little to help. Prejudice has existed in the minds of some against those who have been laboring far beyond their strength to carry forward this work. Those who have given place to unbelief and criticism are under the rebuke of God for every word they have spoken to discourage the workers, and to create prejudice against them. Doing nothing themselves, they have blocked the wheels so that others could not advance.",
