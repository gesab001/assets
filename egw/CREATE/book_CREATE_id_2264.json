    "word": "Mission Schools Should be Started for They \n          Will Hasten the End \n\n\n     Every possible means should be devised to establish schools of the Madison order in various parts of the South; and those who lend their means and their influence to help this work, are aiding the cause of God. I am instructed to say to those who have means to spare: Help the work at Madison. You have no time to lose. Satan will soon rise up to create hindrances; let the work go forward while it may. Let us strengthen this company of educators to continue the good work in which they are engaged, and labor to engage others to do a similar work. Then the light of truth will be carried in a simple and effective way, and a great work will be accomplished for the Master in a short time. --An Appeal for the Madison School.",
