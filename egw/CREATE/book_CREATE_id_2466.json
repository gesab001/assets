    "word": "The spiritual lessons to be learned are of no mean order. The seeds of truth sown in the soil of the heart will not all be lost, but will spring up, first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. God said in the beginning, \"Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit.\" God created the seed as He did the earth, by the divine word. We are to exercise our reasoning power in the cultivation of the earth, and to have faith in the word of God that has created the fruit of the earth for the service of man.",
