    "word": "My brethren, let your hearts become broken and contrite. Let expressions of sympathy and love, which will not blister the tongue, flow from your lips. Let others feel that warmth which love can create in the heart, and educate the professed disciples of Christ to correct the evils that have so long existed,--selfishness, coldness, and hardheartedness. All these traits reveal the fact that Christ is not abiding in the soul [Colossians 3:12, 13 quoted] (RH Jan. 2, 1894).",
