    "word": "Concerning those who have been deceived and led astray by unconsecrated men, the Lord says: \"Their course of action has not been in accordance with my will; yet for the righteousness of my own cause, for the truth's sake, for the sake of those who have preserved their fear and love of God, I, who create the fruit of the lips, will put my message in the lips of those who will not be perverted. Although some may be deceived and blinded in their ideas of men and the purposes of men, I will heal every one who honors my name. All the penitent of Israel shall see my salvation. I, the Lord do rule, and I will fill with praise and thanksgiving the hearts of all who are nigh and afar off even all the penitent of Israel who have kept my way.\"",
