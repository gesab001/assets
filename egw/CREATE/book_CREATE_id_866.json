    "word": "Let all see this institution standing as an institution to promote the happiness and well-being of our fellowmen. Better, far better, to submit to some inconvenience and losses than to become mercenary and create angry feelings, and leave the unhappy impression on the minds that they have been taken advantage of and cheated, and they go away hostile to the institution. The principles and morals of the institution must ever be governed in all relations, to believers and unbelievers, with generous, well-defined principles of nobility and consideration, especially toward those who are suffering affliction.--Letter 26, 1888.",
