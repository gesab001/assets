    "word": "GOD RESPONDED TO DAVID\u2019S PRAYER FOR FORGIVENESS.\u2014One of the most earnest prayers recorded in the Word of God is that of David when he plead, \u201cCreate in me a clean heart, O God.\u201d God\u2019s response to such a prayer is, A new heart will I give you. This is a work that no finite man can do. Men and women are to begin at the beginning, seeking God most earnestly for a true Christian experience. They are to feel the creative power of the Holy Spirit. They are to receive the new heart, that is kept soft and tender by the grace of heaven. The selfish spirit is to be cleansed from the soul. They are to labor earnestly and with humility of heart, each one looking to Jesus for guidance and encouragement. Then the building, fitly framed together, will grow into a holy temple in the Lord.\u2014(SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, 1165.)",
