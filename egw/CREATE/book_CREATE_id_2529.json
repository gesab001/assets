    "word": "Teach these things; educate the people to have a sound, solid experience, and do not create in them an appetite for something new and strange and startling. These are the very things which those who are weak in moral power crave as the liquor drinker craves liquor, and the result is that they are not sound in the understanding of the Word. They have not root in themselves, and when the masterly working of Satan shall be made manifest, and he shall perform miracles to testify that he is Christ, those who have been controlled by feeling, who have fed on the sensational, and have been seeking for strange things, will be carried away, because they are not feeding on Christ. [On the other hand,] \"He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him\" [verse 56]. They receive life from Christ, just as the branch receives its nourishment from the vine.",
