    "word": "The human agent has been granted a second probation. \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" As you look upon your body, you should remember, that you are every moment sustained by the Creator of all things, the preserver of life, the Giver of happiness and peace and grace in obeying His requirements. Any action in eating, drinking, or dressing that is unhealthful, injures the fine works of the human machinery, and interferes with God's order. There are obstructions created in bone, brain, and muscle, which are destroying this wonderful machinery that God has organized to be kept in order. Any misuse of the delicate workmanship results in suffering.",
