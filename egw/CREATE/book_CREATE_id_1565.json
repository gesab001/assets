If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\" Man is God's workmanship, His masterpiece, created for a high and holy purpose; and on every part of the human tabernacle God desires to write His law. Every nerve and muscle, every mental and physical endowment, is to be kept pure.",
