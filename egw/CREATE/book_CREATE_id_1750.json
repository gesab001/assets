    "word": "Chap. 22 - Fresh Themes to be Presented\n \n    The soul should be like a treasure-house, full of rich and fruitful stores. In the pulpit, in the Sabbath-school, in the prayer-meeting, and in society, we should have fresh themes with which to enlighten others. We should follow the example of Jesus, who was the perfect Teacher. He educated men by revealing to them the character of the living God. He said, \u201cThis is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\u201d This is the important subject to impress upon the minds of youth; for they must have a knowledge of the paternal character of God, in order that they may be led to subordinate temporal to eternal interests. By beholding the character of God, an intense desire will be created in their hearts to impart to others the beauty and power of the truth.",
