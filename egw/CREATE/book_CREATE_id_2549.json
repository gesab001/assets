    "word": "To convince one of his errors is a most delicate work; for, through constant exercise, certain modes of acting or thinking become second nature; through habit a moral taste is created; and it is very hard for those who err to see their errors. Many are blind to faults in themselves which are plainly discerned by others. There is always hope of repentance and reformation in one who recognizes his faults. But some are too proud to confess that they are in the wrong, even when their errors are plainly pointed out and they see them. In a general way they will admit that they are human, liable to err; but they expect others to trust them as if they were unerring. Such confessions count nothing with God.",
