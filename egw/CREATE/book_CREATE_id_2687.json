    "word": "There is a higher order of enjoyment and power than man can create, derived from a source above humanity. But in order to fulfill Christ's purpose for you, you must study the truths He has given you. Eat and drink the Word. Put away all fanciful theories. Let the truth stand out in its original power. God's great purposes are to be worked out, after the pattern of things in the heavens. Let God give you your message. Weigh every proposition coming from human beings, for fanciful theories will be brought in.",
