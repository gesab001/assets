{"word": "When Rome at one time determined to exterminate the hated sect, a bull was issued by the pope [INNOCENT VIII., A. D. 1487.] condemning them as heretics, and delivering them to slaughter. They were \n77\nnot accused as idlers, or dishonest, or disorderly; but it was declared that they had an appearance of piety and sanctity that seduced \\93the sheep of the true fold.\\94 Therefore the pope ordered \\93that the malicious and abominable sect of malignants,\\94 if they refuse to abjure, \\93be crushed like venomous snakes.\\94 Did this haughty potentate expect to meet those words again? Did he know that they were registered in the books of Heaven, to confront him at the Judgment? \\93Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,\\94 said Jesus, \\93ye have done it unto me.\\94 [Matthew 25:40.]", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 76}
