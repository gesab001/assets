{"word": "The evidences of the grace of Christ in the human heart always tend to unity. But because some errors and inconsistencies are seen in those whom we think should be perfect, shall we cast them aside? No, Christ does not cast us aside because of these things, \n32\nalthough His Spirit is grieved. It is not wise to sink the soul in pettish despondency, because we see errors in the characters of others. If we discern their faults and inconsistencies, then we are to see the sinfulness of similar things in our own characters, and from these things we are to learn not to practise the unchristlike conduct of any man. We should remember that Jesus discerns all these defects, and is more wounded and grieved than we possibly can be, because His children do not represent His own character to the world, but in some things they represent the impatience, the fretfulness, the malice, the accusing spirit of the great deceiver. What could hurt the heart of Christ more than to be thus wounded and put to open shame in the person of those who claim to be His children? Then when you see wrong in any one, pity them, and say, I will never do after their works, and make Christ ashamed of me.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 31}
