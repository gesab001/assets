    "word": "A Lesson for Our Time \n\n     In the case of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram we have a lesson of warning lest we follow their example. \"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"",
