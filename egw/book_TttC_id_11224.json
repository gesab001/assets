    "word": "To the minister of the gospel God has given the work of guiding to Christ those who have wandered from the narrow way. He is to be wise and earnest in his efforts. At the end of each year he should be able to look back and see souls saved as the result of his labors. Some he is to save with fear, \"pulling \n                                                                           18\nthem out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh,\" \"holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught.\" Jude 23; Titus 1:9. Paul's charge to Timothy comes to the ministers of today: \"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ; . . . Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\" 2 Timothy 4:1, 2.",
