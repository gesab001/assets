{"word": "\"Quit Yourselves Like Men, Be Strong.\"--Young men should have broad ideas, wise plans, that they may make the most of their opportunities, catch the inspiration and courage that animated the apostles. John says, \"I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one\" (1 John 2:14). An elevated standard is presented before the youth, and God is inviting them to come into real service for Him. True-hearted young men who delight to be learners in the school of Christ can do a great work for the Master if they will only give heed to the command of the Captain as it sounds down along the lines to our time: \"Quit you like men, be strong\" (1 Corinthians 16:13).--RH, June 16, 1891.
