{"word": "Dwelling on Unimportant Matters.--During the waking hours the mind will be constantly employed. If it dwells upon unimportant matters, the intellect is dwarfed and weakened. There may be some spasmodic flashes of thought; but the mind is not disciplined to steady, sober reflection. There are themes that demand serious consideration. . . . By dwelling upon these themes of eternal interest, the mind is strengthened and the character developed.--RH, June 10, 1884.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 668}
