    "word": "Dear sister, you have a good mind and can do good. You can be as an anchor to your husband and a strength to many others. But if you stand halting between two opinions, unreconciled to the humble work of God, your influence in connection with your husband's will be exerted in a wrong direction. How reads the word of God? Turn from the opinions of men to the law and to the testimony. Shut out every worldly consideration. Make your decision for eternity. Weigh evidence in this important time. We surely need not expect to escape trial and persecution in following our Saviour; for this is the salary of those who follow Him. He plainly declares that we shall suffer persecution. Our earthly interests must be subservient to the eternal. Listen to the words of Christ: \"Then Peter began to say unto Him, Lo, we have left all, and \n                                                                           496\nhave followed Thee. And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My sake, and the gospel's, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.\" Eternal interests are here involved.",
