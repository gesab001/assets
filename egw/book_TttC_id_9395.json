    "word": "We are called to represent to the world the character of God as it was revealed to Moses. In answer to the prayer of Moses, \"Show me Thy glory,\" the Lord promised, \"I will make all My goodness pass before thee.\" \"And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.\" Exodus 33:18, 19; 34:6, 7. This is the fruit that God desires from His people. In the purity of their characters, in the holiness of their lives, in their mercy and loving-kindness and compassion, they are to demonstrate that the \"law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\" Psalm 19:7.",
