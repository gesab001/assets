{"word": "Entering into the Feelings of the Youth \n\n\n     We should seek to enter into the feelings of the youth, sympathizing with them in their joys and sorrows, their conflicts and victories. Jesus did not remain in heaven, away from the sorrowing and sinful; He came down to this world, that He might become acquainted with the weakness, the suffering, and the temptations of the fallen race. He reached us where we were, that He might lift us up. In our work of the youth, we must meet them where they are, if we would help them. When youthful disciples are overcome by temptation, let not those older in experience deal with them harshly, or regard their efforts with indifference. Remember that you yourselves have often shown but little strength to resist the tempter's power. Be as patient with these lambs of the flock as you wish others to be with you. God has so constituted us that even the strongest desire sympathy. How much more, then, do children need it! Even a look of compassion will often soothe and strengthen the tried, tempted child.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW", "page": 209}
