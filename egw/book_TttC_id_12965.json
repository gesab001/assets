    "word": "\"How much owest thou unto my Lord?\" Luke 16:5. It is impossible to tell. All that we have is from God. He lays His hand upon our possessions, saying: \"I am the rightful owner of the whole universe; these are My goods. Consecrate to Me the tithes and offerings. As you bring these specified goods as a token of your loyalty and your submission to My sovereignty, My blessing shall increase your substance, and you will have abundance.\"",
