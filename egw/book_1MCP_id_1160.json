{"word": "The Great Motive Powers of the Soul.--The great motive powers of the soul are faith, hope, and love; and it is to these that Bible study, rightly pursued, appeals. The outward beauty of the Bible, the beauty of imagery and expression, is but the setting, as it were, for its real treasure--the beauty of holiness. In its record of the men who walked with God, we may catch glimpses of His glory. In the One \"altogether lovely\" we behold Him, of whom all beauty of earth and heaven is but a dim reflection. \"I, if I be lifted up,\" He said, \"will draw all men unto Me\" (John 12:32).--Ed 192 (1903).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 349}
