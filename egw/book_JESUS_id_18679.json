{"word": "We have long been looking and waiting for the coming of the Lord; but are we doing all in our power to hasten His coming? \"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance\" (2 Peter 3:9). While the Lord is ever working, while all heaven is engaged in the work on earth to draw men to Christ and repentance, what are the human agents doing to be channels of light, that they may cooperate with the divine agencies? Are they daily inquiring, \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\" (Acts 9:6). Are they practicing self-denial, as did Jesus? Are they deeply stirred, their hearts drawn out in prayer to God that they may be receiving of His grace, the Holy Spirit of God, that they may have wisdom to work with their ability and their means to save souls that are perishing out of Christ?--Review and Herald, May 16, 1893.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 176}
