{"word": "15 (see EGW on Exodus 20:1-17; Romans 3:31). Obedience Possible in Our Humanity.--We are not to serve God as if we were not human, but we are to serve Him in the nature we have, that has been redeemed by the Son of God; through the righteousness of Christ we shall stand before God pardoned, and as though we had never sinned. We will never gain strength in considering what we might do if we were angels. We are to turn in faith to Jesus Christ, and show our love to God through obedience to His commands (MS 1, 1892).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1142}
