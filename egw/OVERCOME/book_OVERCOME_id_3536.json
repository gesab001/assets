    "word": "I hope that none will be discouraged because of the failure of plans and of ardent hopes. The blessing of the Lord is always promised on conditions. He will bless us in harmony with His own laws. There may seem to be something lacking that will insure success, but in time we may see that our success is not always the greatest when we get what we wish. You may be tried like gold, and if you bear the trial rightly, your soul may be more benefited than it would be by great prosperity. My brother, keep humble, keep meek and lowly. You want to be a bold, successful soldier of Christ; you want to be a valiant overcomer. God grant that you may win the crown of life.",
