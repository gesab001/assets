    "word": "Of Christ it is said that He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin. His human nature did not yield to the suggestions of Satan on a single point. And, if the Lord Jesus has overcome the temptations of Satan, every son and daughter of Adam may overcome. But there is only one way in which any of us can do this. It is to obey His voice. Let all \n\n\n                               -366- \n\ncarefully read the prayer of Daniel: \"As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth\" (Daniel 9:13). This has been our deficiency. The Word has not been a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. But this it should be, for the Lord, He is God.--Letter 3, 1897, pp. 9-11. (To the Brethren and Sisters in Adelaide, May 6, 1897.)",
