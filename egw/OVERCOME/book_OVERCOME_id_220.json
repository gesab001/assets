    "word": "Some will acknowledge the evil of sinful indulgence, yet will excuse themselves by saying that they cannot overcome their passions. This is a terrible admission for a Christian to make. \u201cLet every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:19.] Why is this weakness?\u2014It is because men and women have so long pampered their depraved appetites that they have no power of self-government;\u2014because the lower passions of their nature have taken the reins, and high moral principle, which should be the governing power, is gone. Sensuality has quenched the desire for holiness, and has withered spirituality. The soul is held in lowest bondage.",
