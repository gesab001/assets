    "word": "Watch, Pray, Work, are the Christian's watchwords. Satan is vigilant in his efforts. His perseverance is untiring, his zeal earnest and unabated. He does not wait for his prey to come to him, he seeks for it. To wrench souls from the hand of Christ, is his determined purpose; yet souls are asleep in their blindness --insane in their pursuits. God is not in their thoughts. A vigilant foe is upon the track of the Christian; yet he is in no danger while he makes God his trust. But unless he puts his trust in God, his strength will be weakness, and he will be overcome by Satan.",
