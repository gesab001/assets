White Materials in the Lucinda Hall Collection\n\n     I saw that there was great necessity of more energy being manifested by the commandment keepers in their meetings, and out of their meetings. I saw that all should have something to say for God, and by so doing they would be blessed, for a book of remembrance is kept of those who do not forsake the assembling of themselves together. The remnant are to overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.",
