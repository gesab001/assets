    "word": "The words that some have spoken against the chosen ministers of God have been spoken against Christ. The sarcastic references made by physicians to those ministers who did not entertain the same ideas as they themselves with reference to the so-called medical missionary work, have had their influence. God will work in His own time and His own way to counteract the leaven that has thus been introduced; but at what a cost has this influence been exerted! The effect of this influence will not be fully known until the judgment sits and the books are opened. Then it will be seen that souls who might have stood firm as overcomers were confused and led into crooked paths by physicians.",
