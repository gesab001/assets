    "word": "If your soul is tainted, your lips utter perverseness. But your position gives you no right to utter cutting words. It is not your right to disturb the peace of any soul or to utter words that aggravate the temptations of one who is struggling to overcome. Thus you drive your fellow creatures to Satan's battle ground. When one needs to be corrected, it is humiliating for them to have their wrongs pointed out. Do this kindly. \"Considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.\" The Lord sees far more faults in you than in those upon whom you have borne so heavily.",
