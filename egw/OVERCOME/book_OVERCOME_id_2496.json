    "word": "The difficulties which those who put on Christ and keep His commandments must undergo, are not of Christ's designing. \"If any man will come after me,\" He says, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Matthew 16:24). The duty of intelligent souls is to hold to the truth, to practice virtue. We are born with a disinclination to both. It is sad to find in one's own constitution an opposition to virtues that are commendable in the sight of God, as submission, charity, sweetness of spirit, and patience that will not be provoked. Say to yourselves, dear children, I am weakness, but God is my strength. He has given me my post of duty. The General whom I serve bids me be an overcomer. . . .",
