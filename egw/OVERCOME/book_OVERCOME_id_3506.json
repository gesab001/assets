    "word": "-316- \n\n     The Lord is looking upon us in mercy and love today. Who will follow out the will of the Lord? Who will study to overcome the hasty temper, remembering that the words they speak are spoken in the hearing of heavenly angels? These heavenly agencies are continually ministering to us, and they will speak through us and by us if we will walk humbly with God. They open for us opportunities to make known to others a knowledge of the God of heaven. Let us acknowledge God as the highest power. Let us cherish our Redeemer's spirit of meekness and humility of mind. Let us study our life work, that it may bear the test of the judgment. We shall then stand on vantage ground with Daniel and his companions, overcoming by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony.",
