    "word": "Satan comes with his temptation upon the point of appetite, the same point upon which Adam stumbled and fell. Christ fasted forty days and forty nights. The race had degenerated and had been growing weaker and weaker. The Son of God saw it was impossible for man to overcome in his own behalf, and therefore He comes to our world and gives man divine power that he might obtain the victory. Here we see that Satan's first attempt was upon the point of appetite, and he seeks to overcome Him.",
