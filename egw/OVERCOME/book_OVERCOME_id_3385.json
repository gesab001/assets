    "word": "It has been bitterly cold, snow came two feet upon the level, everything frozen up in wash pitchers and bowl, teeth frozen in a solid mass of ice, and ink frozen. Yesterday the weather moderated, and the sleighs are flying briskly. I looked upon the world around me clothed in its pure vestment of white. Whiter than the snow, God has promised to make all who shall come to Him with broken hearts and contrite spirits. A beautiful symbol is before me of those who are mentioned in Revelation, \"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels\" (Revelation 3:4, 5). Praise the Lord. With my whole heart will I give thanks unto His holy name.",
