    "word": "Unfaithful men who had been entrusted with the work at the Office and the Institute, had, through selfishness and lack of consecration, placed matters in the worst condition possible. There was unsettled business that had to be settled. My husband stepped into the gap, and worked with all his energies. He was wearing. We could see that he was in danger; but how he could stop, we could not tell, unless the work in the Office should cease. Almost every day some new perplexity would arise, some new matter of difficulty, caused by the unfaithfulness of the men who had taken charge of the work. His brain was taxed to the utmost, until the worst perplexities are now overcome, and the work is moving on prosperously.",
