    "word": "To those who are working for such ones I would say, Open the Bible before the tempted, struggling soul, and over and over again read to him the promises of the living God. Hold fast to him until he has given himself, body, soul, and spirit, to God. In the past he has been ruled over by Satan, but by prayer and faith rescue him from this cruel power. Place his hand in the hand of Christ. Again and again the poor victim will be almost overcome by the craving for strong drink, but do not let him go. Labor for him as a true medical missionary, and God will bless your efforts.",
