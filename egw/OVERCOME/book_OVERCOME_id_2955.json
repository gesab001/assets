    "word": "Bro. and Sr. Buck, you have a work to do \n                                                                           9\nfor yourselves, which no one can do for you. You are inclined to murmur and complain. You have something to do to subdue your natural feelings. Live for God yourselves, knowing that you have not to answer for the wrongs of others. I saw, Bro. Buck, that you would certainly be overcome by Satan, and make utter shipwreck of faith unless you stop your fault-finding, and seek pure and undefiled religion before God. You need to be elevated in your thoughts and conversation. You need a thorough conversion.",
