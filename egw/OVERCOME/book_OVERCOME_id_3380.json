    "word": "I have determined that I will not confess the sins of those who profess to believe the truth, but leave these things for them to confess. This I sincerely hope that you will do. You know the things which are keeping you from making progress. Will you, in the name of Jesus, be determined that you will be an overcomer? You will not grow spiritually until you do this. Jesus came to our world and fought the battles with Satan in our behalf. He overcame the wily foe, making it possible for every soul to overcome in the name and strength of Jesus on his own account and in his own behalf. \n     [Revelation 2:7, 11, 17; 3:5, 12, 21, quoted.]",
