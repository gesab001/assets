    "word": "The Psalmist, when viewing the many snares and temptations to vice, inquires, \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?\" This question is appropriate for every one connected with our missions and every instrumentality of God. At this stage of our work, the answer comes, \"By taking heed thereto according to thy word.\" It is necessary to maintain a living connection with Heaven, seeking as often as did Daniel, -- three times a day, -- for divine grace to resist appetite and passion. Wrestling with appetite and passion unaided by divine power will be unsuccessful; but make Christ your stronghold, and the language of your soul will be, \"In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.\" Said the \n\n\n                       -37- \n\nApostle Paul, \"I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others I myself should be a castaway.\" Let no one think he can overcome without the help of God. You must have the energy, the strength, the power, of an inner life developed within you. You will then bear fruit unto godliness, and will have an intense loathing of vice. You need to constantly strive to work away from earthliness, from cheap conversation, from everything sensual, and aim for nobility of soul and a pure and unspotted character. Your name may be kept so pure that it cannot justly be connected with anything dishonest or unrighteous, but will be respected by all the good and pure; and it may be written in the Lamb's book of life, to be immortalized among the holy angels.",
