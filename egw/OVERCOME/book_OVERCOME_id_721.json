    "word": "Some obtain answers to prayer, a little freedom, and they become elated. They do not increase in faith, do not grow in strength and courage, but they depend on feeling. If they happen to feel well, they think they are in favor with God. How many stumble here! how many are overcome! Feeling is no criterion for any of us. \u201cFaith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d [Hebrews 11:1.] We are to examine our character in God's mirror, his holy law, to detect our errors and imperfections, and then to remove them by the precious blood of Christ.",
