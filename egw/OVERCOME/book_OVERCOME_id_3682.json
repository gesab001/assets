    "word": "A teacher, whether engaged in physical labor or imparting mental instruction, unless he shall overcome his habits of slackness and inefficiency, will impart these same objectionable traits of character to those who are under him, and the essential qualities for success will be lacking in the students. A superficial character is revealed by habits of slackness and a failure to see and to do promptly whatever needs to be done.",
