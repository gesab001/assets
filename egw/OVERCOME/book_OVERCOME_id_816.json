    "word": "Those that overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil, will be the favored ones who shall receive the seal of the \n91\nliving God. Those whose hands are not clean, whose hearts are not pure, will not have the seal of the living God. Those who are planning sin and acting it will be passed by. Only those who, in their attitude before God, are filling the position of those who are repenting and confessing their sins in the great anti-typical day of atonement, will be recognized and marked as worthy of God\u2019s protection. The names of those who are steadfastly looking and waiting and watching for the appearing of their Saviour\u2014more earnestly and wishfully than they who wait for the morning\u2014will be numbered with those who are sealed.",
