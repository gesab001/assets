    "word": "Your influence is to be far reaching, and your powers of speech should be under the control of reason. When you strain the organs of speech, the modulations of the voice are lost. The tendency to rapid speaking should be decidedly overcome. God claims of the human instrumentality all the service that man can give. All the talents entrusted to the human agent are to be cherished and appreciated, and used as a precious endowment of heaven. The laborers in the harvest field are God's appointed agents, channels through which He can communicate light from heaven. The careless, improvident use of any of their God-given powers lessens their efficiency so that in an emergency, when the greatest good might be done, they are so weak and sickly and crippled that they can accomplish but little.--Special Testimonies, Series A, No. 7, pp. 9-11.
