    "word": "Sanitarium, Cal., Jan. 17, 1905. \n\n     Dear Brother-----: I have recently learned of the burning of a portion of the Melrose sanitarium. At first I felt almost overcome, but later I learned that only a part of the main building had been destroyed. I want you to see, my brother, that the Lord is good. Do not mourn over the loss, as long as the best part of the building is saved. Thank the Lord that considerable of the furniture was saved, and, above all, that no one was hurt or killed.",
