    "word": "Jesus loves the young, and He longs to have them possess that peace which He alone can impart. . . . If we have become the disciples of Christ we shall be learning of Him--every day learning how to overcome some unlovely trait of character, every day copying His example and coming a little nearer the Pattern. If we are ever to inherit those mansions that He has gone to prepare for us we must here be forming such characters as the dwellers there are to possess.",
