The white robes are the garments of Christ's righteousness, and all who have this righteousness are partakers of the divine nature. They have written upon them, \"The name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name\" (verse 12).--Letter 48, June 1, 1898, to a believer in Australia.",
