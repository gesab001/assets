    "word": "Provision has been made whereby every soul that is struggling under sinful practices may be made free from sin. \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). The Christian is not to retain his sinful habits and cherish his defects of character, but he is to be renewed in the spirit of his mind after the divine similitude. Whatever may be the nature of your defects, the Spirit of the Lord will enable you to discern them, and grace will be given you whereby they may be overcome. Through the merits of the blood of Christ you may be a conqueror--yes, more than a conqueror. . . .",
