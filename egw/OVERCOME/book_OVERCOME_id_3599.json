    "word": "A work is to be done in the Lord's vineyard which will testify to the genuineness and value of the truth, and will glorify God. We are to labor for those who when converted will be a help in the work, producers not consumers. But the work done for the lowest class of outcasts is a very uncertain matter. Those who spend their time and strength in work for those who will never do anything but hang upon them for help, disqualify themselves for the position God would have them fill in His army. Workers are greatly needed to labor for those who rightly handled will come to a knowledge of the truth, and will then do valuable service in the cause. But those who after being prayed with say, I am saved, have no real understanding of what it means to receive Christ. No man can say, I am saved, until he has endured test and trial, until he has shown that he can overcome temptation. Those who fail to do the work which God has said should be done soon lose the right perception of spiritual things, and become blinded as to the character of the truth. They are unfitted to do the work which would make them complete in Christ.",
