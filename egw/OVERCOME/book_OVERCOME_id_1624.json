    "word": "35 (see EGW on John 1:1-3, 14). The Son of God in a New Sense.--Christ brought men and women power to overcome. He came to this world in human form, to live a man amongst men. He assumed the liabilities of human nature, to be proved and tried. In His humanity He was a partaker of the divine nature. In His incarnation He gained in a new sense the title of the Son of God. Said the angel to Mary, \"The power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\" While the Son of a human being, He \n                                                                           1115\nbecame the Son of God in a new sense. Thus He stood in our world--the Son of God, yet allied by birth to the human race. . . .  {5BC 1114.10}  \n     From all eternity Christ was united with the Father, and when He took upon Himself human nature, He was still one with God. He is the link that unites God with humanity [Hebrews 2:14 quoted] (ST Aug. 2, 1905).",
