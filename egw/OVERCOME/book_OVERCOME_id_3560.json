    "word": "I pity Dan Jones. I have talked with him freely. I begged of him last year at the Ministerial Institute, for Christ's sake, to not help you to keep the position you then occupied, I begged of him to lend his influence to help you to come out into the clear light. I told him I knew your dangers. You were a man like Elder Butler, - would not confess a wrong step but would make many more wrong steps to justify your first wrong step, when, if you would overcome that stubbornness that is ingrained into your life and character, the power of God would make you a man of efficiency to the very close of time. But unless you become a new bottle, the wine (?) of light and the power of the grace of God could not come to you.",
