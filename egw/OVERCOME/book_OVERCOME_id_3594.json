    "word": "Jesus stood forth in human nature a conqueror in behalf of the fallen race. He was an overcomer in behalf of every human being, and as a pledge that all who shall receive His name may resist the temptations of Satan, and overcome in their own behalf as Christ has overcome in theirs. There is not one of the feeblest of humanity but can be a conqueror by being a partaker of the divine nature. As the branch is united to the vine and becomes partaker of the \n\n\n                                   - 48 - \n\nnourishment of the vine, so he who is one with Christ absorbs the elements of the life of Christ, and are branches of the living vine. Every member of the human family is honored by the achievements of His wonderful victory, making it possible for every soul to become a partaker of the divine nature if he will connect with Christ.",
