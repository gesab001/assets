    "word": "When in the name of Christ you ask for grace to overcome, it will be given unto you; for the promise is \"Ask, and it shall be given you\" (Matthew 7:7). Yes, seek God for aid. If you are in perplexity, do not go to your neighbors. Learn to carry your troubles to God. If you seek you will find; if you knock, it shall be opened unto you. But this means faith, faith, faith. Exercise living faith in Christ. . . .",
