    "word": "Lowliness of heart, that meekness which is the fruit of abiding in Christ, is the true secret of blessing. \"He will beautify the meek with salvation.\" . . . It was through the desire for self-exaltation that sin entered into the world, and our first parents lost the dominion over this fair earth, their kingdom. It is through self-abnegation that Christ redeems that which was lost. And He says we are to overcome as He did. Through humility and self-surrender we may become heirs with Him, when the \"meek shall inherit the earth.\" \n                                                                           304",
