    "word": "The Lord is our helper, our defense. God has provided that no soul that trusts in him shall be overcome by the enemy. Christ is just as much with his believing ones when they are compelled to be associated in any sense with the world, as when they meet in his house to worship him. Think of these words: \"Thou has a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.\"",
