    "word": "We think it costs us something to stand in this position before the world; and so it does. But what has our salvation cost the heavenly universe? To make us partakers of the divine nature, heaven gave its most costly treasure. . . . He engaged to stand in a fallen world as the representative of the Father. And He would die in behalf of a lost race. What a work was this! If He should fail, if He should be overcome by temptation, a world would be lost.--Manuscript 99a, Aug. 29, 1908, \"Called to Glory and Virtue,\" sermon preached at Loma Linda, California.",
