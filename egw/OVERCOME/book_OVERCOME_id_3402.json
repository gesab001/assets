    "word": "The Lord has given great light to His people as to how they should treat the erring. They should aid those who need help, who are struggling with all their power to overcome in the name and strength of Jesus. Every true agent of Christ will be a doer of His words, will wear His yoke, and be [a] laborer together with Him. Those who are followers of Christ will not exhibit characteristics that are cheap and selfish, but in word, spirit, and action they will reveal the tenderness of Christ.",
