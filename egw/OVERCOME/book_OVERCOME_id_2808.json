You who weary yourselves in decorating your persons, please bear in mind that Jesus was often weary from incessant toil and self-denial and \n                                                                           31\nself-sacrifice to bless the suffering and needy.

Not because of his weakness and his necessities, but he saw, he felt, the weakness of your natures to resist the temptations of the enemy upon the very points where you are now overcome. He knew that you would be indifferent in regard to your dangers and would not feel your need of prayer. It was on our account, he poured out his prayers to his Father with strong cries and tears.
