Will God be obliged to say of His people today, as He said of Israel, \"I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: How then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine?\" Let us subdue self. Let us overcome every evil trait of character. Then the grapes of the Lord will once more grow on the once-flourishing vine, which will no longer bear the grapes of Sodom and the clusters of Gomorrah.--Letter 141, 1902.",
