    "word": "There is hope for man. Christ says, \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne\" (Revelation 3:21). But let us never forget that the efforts we make in our own strength are utterly worthless. Our strength is weakness; our judgment foolishness. Only in the name and strength of our Conqueror can we conquer. When we are pressed with temptation, when un-christlike desires clamor for the mastery, let us offer fervent, importunate prayer to the heavenly Father, in the name of Christ. This will bring divine aid. In the Redeemer's name we may gain the victory.",
