    "word": "The highest education is to be found in training the mind to advance day to day. The close of each day should find us a day\u2019s march nearer the overcomer\u2019s reward. Day by day our understanding is to ripen. Day by day we are to work out conclusions that will bring a rich reward in this life, and in the life to come. Looking daily to Jesus, instead of to what we ourselves have done, we shall make decided advancement in temporal as well as spiritual knowledge.",
