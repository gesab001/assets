    "word": "The only way in which the Christian will be able to keep himself unspotted from worldly influences will be by searching the Scriptures and by obeying the word of God to the very letter.

But if this result is attained it will be because the truth is cultivated and cherished. . . . \n\n\n                                    -194-",
