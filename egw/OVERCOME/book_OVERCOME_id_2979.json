    "word": "In the world ye shall have tribulation, but in me ye shall have peace. The trials to which Christians are subjected in sorrow, adversity, and reproach, are the appointed means of God to separate the chaff from the wheat. Our selfishness, love of worldly pleasure, evil passions, and pride, must be all overcome, and therefore God sends us afflictions to test and prove us, and show us that these evils exist in our characters; and we must, through his strength and grace, overcome, that we may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. \"For our light affliction,\" says Paul, \"which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.\" Afflictions, crosses, temptations, adversity, and \n                                                                           147\nour varied trials, are God's workmen to refine us, sanctify us, and fit us for the heavenly garner.",
