    "word": "When first the Lord presented before me a certain meeting where the Southern work was being considered, I could not discern the speakers. Later the Lord removed the heavy, heavy burden from my mind by instructing me that in every place where a center is to be made, there will be encountered difficulties that require more than mortal wisdom to overcome. The dependence of the workers must be in God. In every movement they are to be actuated by pure, clean, high principles. But let not the men who have not been in the press of the battle, act as if they had all knowledge in regard to the aftersight, when they have had nothing to do with the foresight.",
