    "word": "Elmshaven, Nov. 29, 1902. I awakened this morning having passed a good night. Slept until three o'clock. I lay in bed until nearly four o'clock, meditating and praying the Lord to give me clearness of perception to understand the truth as it is in Jesus, and then, by appropriating the truth daily, it will be to me the bread of life; the parable will be understood and acted, for is it not of weighty consequence? Eternal life is the result of our humanity availing itself of the privilege of being partakers of the divine nature, having overcome the corruption that is in the world through lust. Watchfulness over our individual self means everything to us.",
