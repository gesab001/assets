    "word": "* * * * *\n     My Dear Willie: I have just finished a letter to your brothers, and will write a few lines to you. I should so love to take you, my sweet Willie, in my arms this moment; but this cannot be. I hope we shall be returned home safely, that we can see you all again in our own happy home. Willie, you must be a good boy; you must overcome an impatient spirit. To be impatient, is not to be willing to wait, to want everything you desire in a moment. You must say to yourself, I'll wait. \n61\n\u201cHe that is slow to anger, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.\u201d Willie, if you would be happy, you must rule well your own spirit. Be obedient to Jenny, love your brothers, and be good all day, and the Lord will love you,\u2014every one will love you.",
