    "word": "I am sorry that Elder _____ by his impetuous spirit, has weakened his influence with you and others. But this has not weakened his influence with me. I know that this hastiness of temper is his infirmity. He will always have to guard against this failing. But I rejoice to think that he has made such good use of the time and ability which God has given him. Had Elder _____ made a tirade against me, whom he calls mother, I should have felt sorry, because of the injury done to himself and to the cause of God. But I would not have turned away from him. He loves the truth, and the Lord loves him. After these outbursts he feels sorry enough, and at such times, he needs the grace of the Lord, and the help of his brethren, that he may make decided efforts to overcome. \"Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned; behold, the judge standeth before the door.\" \"Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.\" [James 5:9, 17.]--Letter 67, 1896, pp. 3, 4. (To Brother and Sister McCullagh, March 30, 1896.)",
