    "word": "\"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.\" Matthew 25:6. Lose no time now in rising and trimming your lamps. Lose no time in seeking perfect unity with one another. We must expect difficulties. Trials will come. Christ, the Captain of our salvation, was made perfect through suffering. His followers will encounter the enemy many times and will be severely tried, but they need not despair. Christ says to them: \"Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\" John 16:33.",
