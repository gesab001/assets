    "word": "Christ has made every provision that every parent who will be controlled by the Holy Spirit will be given strength and grace to be a teacher in \n\n\n                                 -190- \n\nthe home. This education and discipline in the home will have a molding and fashioning influence. There should be no fermented wine to tempt the appetite of the children. If you are under the control of the Spirit of God, you will put all the energy of your being into what you do, and a sanctifying influence will pervade the home. Blemishes in your character will be overcome and parents and children will grow up to the full stature of the measure of the fullness of Christ.--Ms 36, 1899, pp. 1-4 (\"The Marriage at Cana.\" March 21, 1899.)",
