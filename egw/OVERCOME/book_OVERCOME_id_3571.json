    "word": "I beg of you, my brother, to draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Let your zeal, your ambition, be no less than it has been, but let it be wisely directed. Upon those points where you erred in the past, be on your guard against temptation. For Christ's sake, for your soul's sake, be afraid to place yourself in circumstances where you will be tempted to err again. Every time you fall under temptation, it becomes easier for you to repeat the same. When by God's appointment, we are placed in the way of temptation, the Lord will give the special, gracious influence of his Holy Spirit, to enable us to resist evil; he is giving us an opportunity to meet difficulties and obstacles, and overcome them, and thus obtain the record in the books of heaven, Overcomer. But if we begin a warfare against our brethren, we go into the battle alone. The Father of light is not with us. Having taken the case into our own hands, we have to fight the battle in our own strength, and we shall be defeated.",
