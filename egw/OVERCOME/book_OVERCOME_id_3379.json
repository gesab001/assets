    "word": "Every physician in our ranks should be a Christian. God says, \"There shall be an institution established under the supervision of men who have been healed through a belief in God's word, and who have overcome their defects of character. In the world all kinds of provisions have been made for the relief of suffering humanity, but the truth in its simplicity is also to be brought to these suffering ones through the agency of men and women who are loyal to the commandments of God. Therefore sanitariums are to be established throughout our world, and managed by a people who are in harmony with God's laws, a people who will cooperate with God in advocating the truth which determines the case of every soul for whom Christ has died.",
