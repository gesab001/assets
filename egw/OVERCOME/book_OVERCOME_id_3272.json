    "word": "Christ says of you, \"Yet lackest thou one thing.\" He has given you a plain statement [of] what you lack. He has, through His humble servant, shown you that you lack devotion to the glory of God, that you lack moral excellence of character, which would lead you to have an unselfish interest for others. You may be, in the eyes of others, perfect, but in the sight of God you have a spotted character and have selfishness to overcome. These defects will corrupt all your virtue, unless they are overcome.",
