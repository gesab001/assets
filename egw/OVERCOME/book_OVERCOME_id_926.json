    "word": "The Deception Is Almost Universal \n\n     There is now need of earnest, working men and women who will seek for the salvation of souls, for Satan as a powerful general has taken the field, and in this last remnant of time he is working through all conceivable methods to close the door against light that God would have come to His people. He is sweeping the whole world into his ranks, and the few who are faithful to God's requirements are the only ones \n                                                                           171\nwho can ever withstand him, and even these he is trying to overcome.--3SM 389 (1889).",
