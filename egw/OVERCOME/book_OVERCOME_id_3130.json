    "word": "All the heavenly universe is waiting about the throne of God to hear His voice, and go forth to minister unto those who shall be heirs of salvation. They are watching every movement made, and are prepared to cooperate in every good work--for the relief of the suffering, and for the enlightenment of those who are ignorant of the truth. The arch enemy is on the track of every soul, that they shall not be overcomers through the blood of the Lamb, and through the word of their testimony. But if we make the Lord our teacher, \n\n\n                                    -375- \n\nwhen Satan comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard for us against the enemy.",
