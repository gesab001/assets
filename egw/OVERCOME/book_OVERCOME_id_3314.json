For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed....As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me. . . .The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" \"To him that overcometh will I grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.\"",
