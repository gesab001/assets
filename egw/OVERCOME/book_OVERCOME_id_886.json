    "word": "Our own way must be overcome. Pride, self-sufficiency, must be crucified and the vacuum supplied with the Spirit and power of God. . . . Did Jesus Christ, the Majesty of heaven, have His way? Behold Him in travail of soul in Gethsemane, praying to His Father. What forces these blood drops of agony from His holy brow? Oh, the sins of the whole world are upon Him! It was separation from the Father's love that forced from His pale and quivering lips the cry, \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me\" (Matthew 26:39). Three times was the prayer offered, but followed by \"Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done\" (Luke 22:42). This must be our attitude--Not my will, but Thine, O God, be done. This is true conversion.",
