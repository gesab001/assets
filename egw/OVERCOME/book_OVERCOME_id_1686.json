    "word": "The Bible gives but a bare mention of the conflict with Satan in the wilderness of temptation, but it was a terrible ordeal.

All heaven was interested in this conflict, and what joy, what rejoicing there was in heaven because help had been laid upon One who is mighty to overcome, mighty to save!",
