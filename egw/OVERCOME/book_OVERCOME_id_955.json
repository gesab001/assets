    "word": "About two hundred had assembled from all parts of Pennsylvania and southwestern New York. The meetings were held mostly in the opera house, but Sabbath afternoon and evening they were held in the Congregational church. Mrs. White spoke Sabbath afternoon on the necessity of a greater effort on the part of our churches to cherish faith and love. Sunday morning she spoke in the opera house. There was a large audience, filling all the seats and aisles, and crowding about the platform close to the speaker. Her subject was temperance, and she dwelt largely upon the duty of parents so to train their children to habits of fidelity and self-denial, that they need not be overcome when tempted to drink intoxicating liquors.",
