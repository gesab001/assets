    "word": "August 25. Dear children, watch unto prayer. Then you will know that you do know that your life is hid with Christ in God. Those who live in these last days are to be overcomers by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.

There is to be appropriate strength given for daily duties, which is derived from the worshiping of God in the beauty of holiness. The lamp must burn, which is impossible unless it is fed with holy oil. And the oil which is so precious is efficacious only as it is communicated by reflecting light upon the pathway of others. Busy activity is to be proportioned with devotional exercises in worship and diligent, cheerful ministry to the needy souls whose inquiry is, \"What must I do to be saved?\"",
