    "word": "But it is of no use to send missionaries to work in the Southern field unless they are furnished with means from your abundance to help the distressed and those who are in poverty that cannot be described. We may do the work that Christ would do if He were upon earth. We may relieve those whose lives have been one long scene of sorrow. Who will go on in indifference and pay no attention to the woes of those who are in hunger, in nakedness, in ignorance and degradation? Who will rouse up and go without the camp and bear reproach for Christ's sake? Who will put on Christ and seek to rescue their colored brethren from ignominy, crime, and degradation? Who will seek to restore them to the ranks of common humanity? We must not consider them irreclaimable and utterly degenerate. With the spirit of Christ, who did not fail or become discouraged, we may do a work that will cause the heavenly hosts to fill the courts of God with songs of rejoicing. There are many who are looked upon as stoical; who are thought to be unfit to be taught the gospel of Jesus Christ; and yet through the ministration of the Holy Spirit they may be changed by the miracle of divine grace. The stupidity that makes their cases look so hopeless will pass away, for it is the result of great ignorance. The influence of grace will prevail on the human subject, and the dull and \n                                                                           65\nclouded mind will awake and break its fetters. Through divine power the slave to sin may be set free. The sunshine of Christ's righteousness may beam into the chambers of mind and heart. Spiritual life will be seen, and the brutishness will disappear. Inclination to vice will disappear, and ignorance will be overcome. The heart will be purified by the faith that works by love.",
