    "word": "Man may become a fellow laborer with God in carrying out the great work of redemption. God allows each man his own sphere of action while He has given His Word as the guide of life. He has also given the Holy Spirit as a sufficient power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character on the human agent, and, through him, upon all who shall come within the sphere of his influence.",
