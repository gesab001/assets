    "word": "God has made every provision for man to have help which he alone can give him. If he allows his work to hurry, drive, and confuse, so that he will have no time for devotional thought, or for prayer, he will make mistakes. If a standard is not lifted up by Jesus Christ against Satan, he will overcome those who are engaged in the important work for this time.",
