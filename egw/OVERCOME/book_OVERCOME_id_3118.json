    "word": "\"The representation that you make before believers and unbelievers is one of variance and strife. Clear away this rubbish. Press together. Let not the workers think of going elsewhere before a thorough work of humiliation and repentance takes place. Work as for your lives to overcome every evil trait of character. You are not placed in this field of labor to create dissension and alienation. Sweep away the evils that have crept in. 'Consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works.'",
