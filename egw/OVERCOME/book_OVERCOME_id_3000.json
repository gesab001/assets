    "word": "Says the apostle, \"I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one\" (1 John 2:14). You are God's agents to work for the upbuilding, the advancement of His cause, therefore you should put away all levity, jesting, and joking which is not convenient. Put away your spendthrift habits, and learn habits of economy. Be not seeking after amusements, live not for your own selfish gratification, be sober minded. In your God-given manhood rise above every enslaving, debasing habit and practice and encourage a due appreciation of your high calling. Ponder well the paths your feet are treading. Search your Bibles carefully and prayerfully. Study the waymarks, and inquire diligently whether your feet are in the path leading heavenward, or in the path leading to perdition.",
