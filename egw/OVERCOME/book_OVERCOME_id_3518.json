    "word": "Praying: Heavenly Father, we come to Thee just as we are, needy and dependent. And we ask Thee, Lord, that the few words spoken here today may lead those who have heard to seek with all their hearts to overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. Lord, wilt Thou work by Thy Spirit, and let the light of truth shine into human hearts, that souls may turn to Thee, and repent and be converted, that we may meet them in the kingdom of glory. Amen.--Ms. 16, 1913.",
