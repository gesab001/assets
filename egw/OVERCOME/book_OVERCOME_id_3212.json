    "word": "The heart is deceptive and desperately wicked. Looking into the mirror and discerning the defects of character should set us to work, by personal efforts and in penitence and repentance through faith in the grace of Christ, to overcome them. Oh, how many times we shall become weary in the strife against internal foes. We shall long for release and often become discouraged, and then we will, in view of the prize of eternal life, arise again, gird on the armor anew, and toil on to gain the prize. Self-conquest, perfection of the heart, is nothing less than washing our robes of character and making them white in the blood of the Lamb. Thousands fail because they love ease and indulgence and self-gratification. Thousands will gain because they will be persevering, courageous, and vigilant.",
