    "word": "Our Saviour was the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory. But He laid aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might know for Himself the sufferings and temptations of human beings. He came to be their surety, to overcome in their behalf, to live for them a sinless life, that through His power they might obtain the victory over sin.",
