    "word": "Brother C needs a thorough conversion. He does not see himself. If he possessed less self-esteem and more humility of mind, his knowledge could be put to a practical use. He has a work to do for himself which no one else can do for him. He will not yield his views or judgment to any man living, unless compelled to do so. He has traits of character which are most unfortunate and which should be overcome. He is more accountable than B, and his case is worse than his; for he possesses more intellect and knowledge. B has been the shadow of his mind.",
