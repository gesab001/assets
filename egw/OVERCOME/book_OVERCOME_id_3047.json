    "word": "Grythyttehed, Sweden, October 26, 1885. We rise this morning weak, but feeling better than yesterday. I have no appetite for food. Took a cup of milk and a couple of toasted crackers. We cannot leave this place before past three this afternoon. I feel deeply grateful that the Lord has sustained me in speaking to this dear people who have taken their position on the commandments of God. I feel so anxious for them that they may be overcomers and saved with the redeemed at last.",
