    "word": "Love to the next oldest. (I cannot remember the names of either.) Tell her for me that she has a part to act in the cause of God, and if she would be saved she must overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of her testimony. Tell her not to hold back and get barrenness to her soul, but take a part in your little social meetings and she will get great strength to her soul and will not be a clog to the meetings. Tell her to be strong and faint not by the way.",
