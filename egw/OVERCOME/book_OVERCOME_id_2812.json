    "word": "We want our children to be saved; but we must save them in God's appointed way. They must be made to understand that they have something to do if they would win heaven. When I see so many of our children who are receiving no preparation to meet temptation, I feel that I can not do enough in the line of helping to provide places where they can receive an education in the things of God. But unless, when we gather the youth into such places as this, we give them the education that will fit them to be overcomers, we had better not gather them into our institutions. Do we want these children and youth to enter the courts of heaven and enjoy the blessings of eternal life? Then let us work to this end understandingly, and we shall see blessed results for our labors.",
