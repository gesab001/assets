    "word": "When tempted to the unlawful gratification of appetite, you should remember the example of Christ, and stand firm, overcoming as Christ overcame. You should answer, saying, \"Thus saith the Lord,\" and in this way settle the question forever with the prince of darkness. If you parley with temptation, and use your own words, feeling self-sufficient, full of self-importance, you will be overcome. The weapons which Christ used were the words of God, \"It is written;\" and if you wield the sword of the Spirit, you also may come off victorious through the merit of your Redeemer.",
