    "word": "Souls are perishing, and the Lord calls for earnest effort. The Christian religion never makes a man self-centered. Jesus came from heaven to the earth to teach man how to live an unselfish life. He was the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, the Commander of the heavenly host; yet He laid aside His kingly crown and royal robe, and clothed His divinity with humanity, in order that He might stand at the head of humanity, suffering the afflictions of the fallen race. He understands the inconveniences to which mankind is subject. He became poor, that through His poverty we might become rich in the possession of the overcomer's reward.",
