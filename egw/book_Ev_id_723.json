{"word": "False Tests and Man-Made Standards \n\n\n     Teach Fundamental Truths.--Those who would labor in word and doctrine, should be firmly established in the truth before they are authorized to go out into the field to teach others. The truth, pure and unadulterated, must be presented to the people. \n                                                                           212\nIt is the third angel's message that bears the true test to the people. Satan will lead men to manufacture false tests, and thus seek to obscure the value of, and make of none effect, the message of truth.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 211}
