{"word": "Jesus gained the victory through submission and faith in God, and by the apostle He says to us, \"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you\" (James 4:7). We cannot save ourselves from the tempter's power; he has conquered humanity, and when we try to stand in our own strength, we shall become a prey to his devices; but \"the name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.\" Satan trembles and flees before the weakest soul who finds refuge in that mighty name.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 256}
