{"word": "The very blessings which God has given to these men to prove them, to see if they will render \"unto God the things that are God's,\" they use as an excuse that they cannot obey the claims of truth. They have grasped their earthly treasure in their arms and say, \"I must take care of these things; I must not neglect the things of this life; these things are mine.\" Thus the hearts of these men have become as unimpressible as the beaten highway. They close the door of their hearts to the heavenly messenger, who says, \"Come; for all things are now ready,\" and throw it open, inviting the entrance of the world's burden and business cares, and Jesus knocks in vain for admittance.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3T", "page": 384}
