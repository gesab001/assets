    "word": "The end is near, stealing upon us stealthily, imperceptibly, like the noiseless approach of a thief in the night. May the Lord grant that we shall no longer sleep as do others, but that we shall watch and be sober. The truth is soon to triumph gloriously, and all who now choose to be laborers together with God will triumph with it. The time is short; the night soon cometh when no man can work. Let those who are rejoicing in the light of present truth now make haste to impart the truth to others. The Lord is inquiring: \"Whom shall I send?\" Those who wish to sacrifice for the truth's sake are now to respond: \"Here am I; send me.\" Isaiah 6:8. \n\n                                               -",
