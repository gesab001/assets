    "word": "An Aid in the Study of Nature \n\n     He who has a knowledge of God and His word through personal experience is prepared to engage in the study of natural science. Of Christ it is written: \"In Him was life; and \n                                                                           325\nthe life was the light of men.\" John 1:4. When Adam and Eve in Eden lost the garments of holiness, they lost the light that had illuminated nature. No longer could they read it aright. But for those who receive the light of the life of Christ, nature is again illuminated. In the light shining from the cross, we can rightly interpret nature's teaching.",
