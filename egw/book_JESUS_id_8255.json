{"word": "Influence of Truth on the Conscience and on the Heart.--The psalmist says, \"The entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple\" (Psalm 119:130). When truth is working only upon the conscience, it creates much uneasiness; but when truth is invited into the heart, the whole being is brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. Even the thoughts are captured, for the mind of Christ works where the will is submitted to the will of God. \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus\" (Philippians 2:5). He whom the Lord makes free is free indeed, and he cannot be brought into servile bondage to sin.--MS 67, 1894.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 324}
