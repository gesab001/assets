{"word": "Clothing should be plain, neat, comfortable, and of good material.--Our ministers and their wives should be an example in plainness of dress; they should dress neatly, comfortably, wearing good material, but avoiding anything like extravagance and trimmings, even if not expensive; for these things tell to our disadvantage. We should educate the youth to simplicity of dress, plainness with neatness. Let the extra trimmings be left out, even though the cost be but a trifle.--TM 180.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 63}
