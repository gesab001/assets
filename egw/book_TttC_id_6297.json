The word of God came to him, not with the presentation of flattering prospects in this life of large salary, of great appreciation and worldly honor. \"Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee,\" was the divine message to Abraham. The patriarch obeyed, and \"went out, not knowing whither he went,\" as God's light bearer, to keep His name alive in the earth. He forsook his country, his home, his relatives, and all pleasant associations connected with his early life, to become a pilgrim and a stranger.",
