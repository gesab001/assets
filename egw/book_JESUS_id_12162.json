{"word": "We are living in an age of licentiousness, and men and youth are bold in sin. Unless our youth are sacredly guarded, unless they are fortified with firm principles, unless greater care is manifested in choosing their associates and the literature which feeds the mind, they will be exposed to a society whose morals are as corrupt as were the morals of the inhabitants of Sodom. . . . Our youth will meet temptations on every hand, and they must be so educated that they will depend upon higher power, higher teaching, than can be given by mortals. There are despisers of our Lord everywhere, who habitually throw contempt upon Christianity. . . . Those who have not moral power cannot stand in defense of the truth; they have not courage to say: \"Unless such conversation ceases, I cannot remain in your presence. Jesus, the world's Redeemer is my Saviour; in Him is centered my hope of eternal life.\" But this is the very way in which to silence them. If you argue with them, they will have arguments with which to meet you, and nothing you may say will touch them; but if you live for Christ, if you are firm in your allegiance to the God of heaven, you may do for them that which argument will fail to do. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 232}
