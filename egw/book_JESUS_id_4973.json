{"word": "When Nicodemus came to Jesus, Christ laid before him the conditions of divine life, teaching him the very alphabet of conversion. Nicodemus asked, \"How can these things be?\" \"Art thou a master of Israel,\" Christ answered, \"and knowest not these things?\" This question might be addressed to many who are holding positions of responsibility as teachers, but who have neglected the work essential for them to do \n                                                                           460\nbefore they were qualified to be teachers. If Christ's words were received into the soul, there would be a much higher intelligence, and a much deeper spiritual knowledge of what constitutes one a disciple and a sincere follower of Christ. When the test and trial comes to every soul, there will be apostasies. Traitors, heady, highminded and self-sufficient men will turn away from the truth, making shipwreck of their faith. Why? -- Because they did not dig deep, and make their foundation sure. They were not riveted to the eternal Rock. When the words of the Lord, through His chosen messengers, are brought to them, they murmur and think the way is made too strait. Like those who were thought to be the disciples of Christ, but who were displeased by His words, and walked no more with Him, they will turn away from Christ.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 459}
