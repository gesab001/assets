{"word": "All blessings are bestowed upon those who have a vital connection with Jesus Christ. Jesus calls them to Himself not simply to refresh us with His grace and presence for a few hours, and then to send us forth from His light to walk apart from Him in sadness and gloom. No, no. He tells us that we must abide with Him and He with us. . . . Trust in Him continually, and doubt not His love. He knows all our weakness and that which we need. He will give us grace sufficient for our day.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 117}
