{"word": "97\nChildbirth\n     Women to Take Charge in Childbirth.--The time has come now when there are to be--and there should have been long ago--sensible changes.  Men have their appointment to take care of the men, and women are to take care of the women.  But when it comes to bringing the men and women together in private practices of childbirth and such cases--to have them associated right together--I should say it is not right nor to be justified.  Women had their appointed work in Bible times and these women took charge of the women, and there was a special understanding that was the way it should be.  And that is the way it should be now in childbirth.  Let the women be as throughly trained as the men, and let them take charge of these matters.  I speak intelligently.  I speak because I understand what I am speaking about, that there is too great a commonness.--13MR 113 (1911).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 97}
