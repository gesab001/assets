    "word": "Brother White exhibited his Combined Washer and Wringer before the company, including the Brethren Bourdeau, Brother Andrews, my husband, and myself, and we could but look with favor upon it. He has since made us a present of one, which Brother Corliss from Maine, our hired man, in a few moments put together in running order. Sister Burgess, from Gratiot County, our hired girl, is very much pleased with it. It does the work well, and very fast. A feeble woman who has a son or husband to work this machine, can have a large washing done in a few hours, and she do but little more than oversee the work. Brother White sent circulars, which any can have by addressing us, enclosing postage.",
