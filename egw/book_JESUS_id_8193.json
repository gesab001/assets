Pomp, riches, and honor cannot satisfy the heart. \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me.\" The rich, the poor, the high, the low, are alike welcome. He promises to relieve the burdened mind, to comfort the sorrowing, and to give hope to the despondent.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 70}
