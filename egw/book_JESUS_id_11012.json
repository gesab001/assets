{"word": "My husband and I worked on this principle. We said, \"The publishing house is the Lord's institution, and we will economize, reducing our expenses as far as possible.\" The Lord requires self-sacrifice of all His servants to advance His work and make it a success. Let every worker now do his best to sustain and guard our publishing institution in -----. Do you not think that the Lord will be pleased to see this spirit control in all our institutions? We are to bring principle into the work. Jesus said, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me\" (Luke 9:23). Are we ready to follow Christ?--Letter 25, 1896.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 207}
