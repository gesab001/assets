The scoffers mock the waiting, watching ones, and inquire: \"Where is the promise of His coming? You have been disappointed. Engage now with us, and you will prosper in worldly things. Get gain, get money, and be honored of the world.\" The waiting ones look upward and answer: \"We are watching.\" And by turning from earthly pleasure and worldly fame, and from the deceitfulness of riches, they show themselves to be in that position. By watching they become strong; they overcome sloth and selfishness and love of ease. Affliction's fire kindles upon them, and the waiting time seems long. They sometimes grieve, and faith falters; but they rally again, overcome their fears and doubts, and while their eyes are directed heavenward, say to their adversaries: \"I am watching, I am waiting the return of my Lord. I will glory in tribulation, in affliction, in necessities.\"",
