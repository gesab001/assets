{"word": "Chap. 59 - Perfect Obedience Through\nChrist\n[THIS ARTICLE APPEARED IN\nTHE REVIEW AND HERALD, NOV. 1, 1892.]\n\n     \"Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. . . . For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also\" (James 2:24-26). It is essential to have faith in Jesus, and to believe you are saved through Him; but there is danger in taking the position that many do take in saying, \"I am saved.\" Many have said: \"You must do good works, and you will live\"; but apart from Christ no one can do good works. Many at the present day say, \"Believe, only believe, and live.\" Faith and works go together, believing and doing are blended. The Lord requires no less of the soul now, than He required of Adam in Paradise before he fell-- perfect obedience, unblemished righteousness. The requirement of God under the covenant of grace is just as broad as the requirement He made in Paradise--harmony with His law, which is holy, and just, and good. The gospel does not weaken the claims of the law; it exalts the law and makes it honorable. Under the New Testament, no less is required than was required under the Old \n                                                                           374\nTestament. Let no one take up with the delusion so pleasant to the natural heart, that God will accept of sincerity, no matter what may be the faith, no matter how imperfect may be the life. God requires of His child perfect obedience.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 373}
