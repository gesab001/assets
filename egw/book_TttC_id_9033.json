    "word": "The holding of so many Biblical institutes among our own people is not wise. The object is good, but there is a more urgent work to be done in carrying the light of truth into regions where it has not penetrated. The laborers held to work for those who already have a knowledge of the truth are kept away from the people who know it not. By devoting much time year after year to ministerial institutes, our brethren have neglected fields that are white already to harvest. Souls in spiritual blindness, prejudiced by those who misrepresent the truth, have been left unwarned. Oh, the neglect that will be charged against individuals, organizations, and churches in that day when every man shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body! Then it will be seen how great was the measure of responsibility for failing to extend the work into the regions beyond.",
