They had come nine miles from Amherst to spend the evening with us. We had a very pleasant interview, profitable, we hope, to all. Retired about ten. Early next morning we left the comfortable, hospitable home of Brother Smith, to pursue our journey to Washington. It was a slow, tedious route. We left the cars at Hillsborough, and found a team waiting to take us twelve miles to Washington. Brother Colby had a sleigh and blankets, and we rode quite comfortably until we were within a few miles of our destination. There was not snow enough to make good sleighing; the wind arose, and during the last two miles blew the falling sleet into our faces and eyes, producing pain and chilling us almost to freezing.
