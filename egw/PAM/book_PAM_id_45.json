{"word": "Those proclaiming the church is Babylon divert money from a channel of usefulness into a channel of evil.--Those who advocate error, will say, \"The Lord saith, when the Lord hath not spoken.\" They testify to falsehood, and not to truth. If those who have been proclaiming the message that the church is Babylon, had used the money expended in publishing and circulating this error, in building up, instead of tearing down, they would have made it evident that they were with the people whom God is leading. . . . If those who have done this kind of work, had felt the necessity of answering the prayer of Christ that He offered to His Father just previous to His crucifixion,--that the disciples of Christ might be one as He was one with the Father,--they would not be wasting the means intrusted to them, and so greatly needed to advance the truth. They would not be wasting precious time and ability in disseminating error, and thus necessitate the devoting of the laborer's time to counteracting and quenching its influence. A work of this character is inspired not from above, but from beneath.--TM 43, 44.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 31}
