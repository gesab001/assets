{"word": "Some preach only that part of the truth that pleases people, and neglect stewardship.--Are you, brethren, preaching that part of the truth that pleases the people, while other parts of the work are left incomplete? Will it be necessary for some one to follow after you, and urge upon the people the duty of faithfully bringing all the tithes and offerings into the Lord's treasury? This is the work of the minister, but it has been sadly neglected. The people have robbed God, and the wrong has been suffered because the minister did not want to displease his brethren. God calls these men unfaithful stewards.--RH July 8, 1884.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 259}
