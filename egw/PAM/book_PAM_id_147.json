{"word": "Ministers should not gain wealth by speculation.--I cannot lend my influence in any way to prompt you or any of my brethren to gain wealth by speculation and extortion; you are not to be united with those who certainly do this. The men of solid worth are most apt to be found with those who possess little of this world's goods, and what they do possess they have gained by diligence, honesty, and economy, and not by speculation. Those who are suitably remunerated for their labors ought not, if they practice economy, to be in rags, or on the verge of pauperism, or overwhelmed in debt.--Testimonies on the Case of Elder E. P. Daniels (Ph 96) 36.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 66}
