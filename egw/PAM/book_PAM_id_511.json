{"word": "Mrs. White participated in a wedding at her own home.--About 11:00 a.m. Tuesday our large dining room was prepared for the wedding ceremony.\n202\nBrother Starr officiated in the service, and it passed off nicely. The request was made by Brother Hickox that Sister White should offer prayer after the marriage ceremony. The Lord gave me special freedom. My heart was softened and subdued by the Spirit of God. On this occasion there were no light jests or foolish sayings. Everything was solemn and sacred in connection with this marriage. Everything was of an elevating character and deeply impressive.--10MR 196.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 201}
