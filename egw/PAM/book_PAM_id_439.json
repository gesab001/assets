{"word": "Public prayers should be spoken slowly, distinctly, and loudly enough so all may hear and unite in saying Amen.--When in the congregation you offer prayer, remember that you are addressing God, and that He desires you to speak so that all who are present can hear and can blend their supplications with yours. A prayer uttered so hurriedly that the words are jumbled together, is no honor to God and does the hearers no good. Let ministers and all who\n181\noffer public prayer learn to pray in such a way that God will be glorified and the hearers will be blessed. Let them speak slowly and distinctly, and in tones loud enough to be heard by all, so that the people may unite in saying Amen.--6T 383.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 180}
