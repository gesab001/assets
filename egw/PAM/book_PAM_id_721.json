{"word": "Christ's example shows ministers how to handle buffeting.--Are the ministers of Christ tempted and fiercely buffeted by Satan? so also was He who knew no sin. Christ, our example, turned to His Father in these hours of distress. He came to earth that He might provide a way whereby we could find grace and strength to help in every time of need, by following His example in frequent, earnest prayer. If the ministers of Christ will imitate this pattern, they will be imbued with His spirit, and angels will minister unto them.--RH May 19, 1885.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 283}
