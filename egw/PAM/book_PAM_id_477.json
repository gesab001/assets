{"word": "Christ-centered sermons come from Christ-centered preachers.--Will my brethren take heed that no glory is given to men? Will they acknowledge that Christ does the work upon the human heart, and not they themselves? Will my ministering brethren plead with God alone in secret prayer for his presence and his power? Dare not to preach another discourse until you know, by your own experience, what Christ is to you.--TM 154, 155.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 192}
