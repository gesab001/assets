{"word": "When the Holy Spirit moves, all prejudice will be melted away and we will approach God as one brotherhood.--When the Holy Spirit moves upon human minds, all petty complaints and accusations between man and his fellow man will be put away. The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness will shine into the chambers of the mind and heart. In our worship of God there will be no distinction between rich and poor, white and black. All prejudice will be melted away. When we approach God, it will be as one brotherhood. We are pilgrims and strangers, bound for a better country, even a heavenly. There all pride, all accusation, all self-deception, will forever have an end. Every mask will be laid aside, and we shall \"see Him as He is.\" There our songs will catch the inspiring theme, and praise and thanksgiving will go up to God.--RH Oct. 24, 1899.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 93}
