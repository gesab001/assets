{"word": "Members must not wait for ministers to come and help inquirers.--Many who are now left to darkness and ruin could have been helped, had their brethren--common men and women--come to them with the love of Christ glowing in their hearts, and put forth personal efforts for them. Many are waiting to be thus personally addressed. Humble, earnest conversation with such persons, and prayer for them, heart being brought close to heart, would in most cases be wholly successful. But instead of this, those who profess to be following their Saviour rest content with expressing a desire that some brother or minister may come and help them. Thus they neglect the very work that God has left for them to do. Just the way in which this work is to be done in every case cannot be rigidly prescribed, but as they come in closer connection with the world's Redeemer, ways and means will be suggested to their minds.--RH June 10, 1880.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 149}
