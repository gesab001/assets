{"word": "Speaking helpful, encouraging words in the home is far more effective than preaching.--This is home missionary work,--work that God's ministers are to strive faithfully to do. They are not only to preach; they are to minister by going from house to house, becoming acquainted with the different families in the church, some of whom may be converted, while others are still without God and without hope in the world. It is possible to preach many sermons without accomplishing the work essential for the well-being of the people of God. The discourses given are to be followed with personal labor. A work may be done by visiting people in their homes, and speaking helpful, encouraging words to them, which will be far more effective than the work done by preaching.--RH Jan. 31, 1899.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 229}
