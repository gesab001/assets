{"word": "Exercise\n \n\n     Exercise renews the body and makes more pastoral labor possible.--The whole system needs the invigorating influence of exercise in the open air. A few hours of manual labor each day would tend to renew the bodily vigor and rest and relax the mind. In this way the general health would be promoted and a greater amount of pastoral labor could be performed. The incessant reading and writing of many ministers unfit them for pastoral work.--CH 193.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 70}
