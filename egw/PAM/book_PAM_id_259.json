{"word": "Other Church Workers\n \n\n     God has ordained that the talents of minds in various callings be blended to do His work.--No one man, whether a teacher, a physician, or a\n108\nminister, can ever hope to be a complete whole. God has given to every man certain gifts and has ordained that men be associated in His service in order that the varied talents of many minds may be blended. The contact of mind with mind tends to quicken thought and increase the capabilities. The deficiencies of one laborer are often made up by the special gifts of another.--CT 521.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 107}
