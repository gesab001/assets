{"word": "Teachers\n \n\n     The influence of Christian teachers ranks with that of Christian ministers.--Those who undertake the work of educating others, will need patience, that they may carry their pupils forward from one point to another in intellectual and spiritual attainment. Those who instruct in the various branches of the work, should feel how great is the responsibility that rests upon them. They need enlarged views, for their work, in its influence, ranks with that of the Christian minister. Meetings for instruction should be called, time should be given, facilities should be provided, that all the knowledge possible may be imparted during the meeting. The work of co-operating with the gospel minister in carrying the present truth to all nations, tongues, and peoples, is indeed a most essential one. It should be conducted in a manner in keeping with the exalted truth which we profess to love.--RH May 20, 1890.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 109}
