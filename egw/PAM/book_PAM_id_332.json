{"word": "Prisons\n \n\n     Those within prison walls need comfort and encouragement.--Then what is traced in your diary this year? Does it record an experience gained by ministering to the suffering, the poor, and the needy? Those who are suffering for Christ's sake, who will not yield the truth for error, who, perhaps, are incarcerated within prison walls, these need comfort and encouragement. This is the kind of work that is deciding our destiny. There is a precious reward awaiting those who are faithful in their ministry. They will have a home in the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for them that love him and wait for his appearing.--YI Aug. 19, 1897.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 140}
