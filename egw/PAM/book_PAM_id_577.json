{"word": "When visiting aim to converse with all family members, whether they profess the truth or not.--Visiting from house to house forms an important\n230\npart of the minister's labors. He should aim to converse with all the members of the family, whether they profess the truth or not. It is his duty to ascertain the spiritual condition of all; and he should live so near to God that he can counsel, exhort, and reprove, carefully and in wisdom. He should have the grace of God in his own heart and the glory of God constantly in view. All lightness and trifling is positively forbidden in the word of God. His conversation should be in heaven, his words seasoned with grace.--2T 338.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 229}
