{"word": "Young ministers should learn from both the strengths and weaknesses of their mentors.--Frequently a young man is sent out to labor with a more experienced minister; and if he is defective in his manner of speaking, the young man is very apt to copy his defects. Therefore, it is important that ministers who have been long in the field should reform, though it cost them much painstaking and the exercise of much patience, that their defects may not be reproduced in young and inexperienced laborers. The young preacher should copy only the admirable traits of character possessed by the more experienced laborer, while at the same time he should see and avoid his errors.--RH Feb. 5, 1880.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 46}
