{"word": "Too many children trained in the Scriptures at Sabbath school, still have no interest in religion.--Many of the children of believing parents, children who have been trained in the Sabbath school, and are familiar with the Scriptures, have yet no interest in religion. Under the most powerful appeals of the Holy Spirit, they seem as unmoved as if chiseled out of stone. What can be done to break the spell which Satan has cast upon these souls? I can see no help, except as parents shall present their children at the throne of grace, in humble, earnest, believing prayer, entreating the Lord to work with their efforts and the efforts of their ministers, until conviction and conversion shall be the result.--ST March 16, 1882.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 279}
