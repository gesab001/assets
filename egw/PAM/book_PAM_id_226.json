{"word": "Many ministers can talk doctrine, but are ignorant of the lessons of Christ.--The minister cannot give to others that which he himself does not possess. If Christ is not abiding in the soul, how can He be presented to others in harmonious words of love? Many are able to talk upon doctrinal points, but they are ignorant of the lessons of Christ. Such men cannot be a blessing either in the pulpit or at the fireside.--RH Sept. 2, 1890.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 97}
