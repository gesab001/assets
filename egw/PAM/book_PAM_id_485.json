{"word": "Christ gathered illustrations from the customs and experiences of daily life.--Christ never flattered men; He never spoke that which would exalt their fancies and imaginations, or praised them for their clever inventions. But those who were deep, unprejudiced thinkers received His words, and found that it put their wisdom to the stretch to comprehend the spiritual truths which He revealed in the simplest language. The so-called great men of the world are generally the most ignorant in regard to what constitutes true religion, and it is fitting to address to them the most simple language, for the eloquence of the truth forces conviction upon the soul. Both the educated and the uneducated have need to be addressed in the plainest, simplest language. The advocates of truth should learn from the World's Redeemer, and pattern after the greatest Teacher the world ever knew, who spake as never man spake.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 194}
