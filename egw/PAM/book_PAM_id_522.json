{"word": "Another minister follows the first, and in the fear of God presents the practical duties, the claims of God upon His people. Some draw back, saying, \"Our minister who brought us the truth did not mention these things. We have been deceived. These things were kept back.\" And they become offended because of the Word. Some will not accept the tithing system; they reject systematic benevolence, and become offended, turn away, and no longer walk with those who believe and love the truth. When the tract and missionary field is opened before them, inviting them to work in it, they answer, \"It was not so taught us,\" and they hesitate to engage in the work. How much better it would be for the cause, if the messenger of truth had faithfully and thoroughly educated these converts in regard to all these essential matters, even if there were less whom he could number as being added to the church under his labors.--RH Dec. 12, 1878.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 207}
