{"word": "Neglecting the body is not the humility that savors of heaven.--But this voluntary humility, this will-worship and neglecting of the body, is not the humility that savors of heaven. That humility will be particular to have the person and actions and apparel of all who preach the holy truth of God, right and perfectly proper, so that every item connected with us will recommend our holy religion. The very dress will be a recommendation of the truth to unbelievers. It will be a sermon in itself.--3SM 251.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 62}
