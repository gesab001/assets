{"word": "36: Church Discipline\n \n\nNecessity of Discipline\n \n\n     Pastors having too little courage to reprove wrong are held accountable for the evil that may result.--Those who have too little courage to reprove wrong, or who through indolence or lack of interest make no earnest effort to purify the family or the church of God, are held accountable for the evil that may result from their neglect of duty. We are just as responsible for evils that we might have checked in others by exercise of parental or pastoral authority as if the acts had been our own.--PP 578.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 209}
