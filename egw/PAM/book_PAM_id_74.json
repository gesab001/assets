{"word": "Preachers should not unite their influence with critics of the church.--When plied with the arguments and suggestions of such advisers, it would be well for us each to inquire, \"Should I, who am a Christian, a child of God; one called to be the light of the world, a preacher of righteousness; who have so often expressed my confidence in the truth and the way in which the Lord has led us, should I unite my influence with those who bitterly oppose the work of God? Should I, a steward of the mysteries of God, open to His worst enemies the counsels of His people? Would not such a course embolden the wicked in their opposition to the truth of God and to His covenant-keeping people? Would not such concession prevent me from opening my lips in exhortation, warning, or entreaty in my own family or in the church of God? If Paul or Peter were placed in similar circumstances, would he thus betray a sacred trust?\"--ST Jan. 3, 1884.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 41}
