{"word": "The success of a minister depends much upon his deportment out of the desk. When he ceases preaching, and leaves the desk, his work is not finished; it is only commenced. He must then carry out what he has preached. He should not move heedlessly, but set a watch over himself, lest something that he may do and say be taken advantage of by the enemy, and a reproach be brought upon the cause of Christ.--1T 380.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 56}
