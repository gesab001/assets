{"word": "Sin is sin even when the seducer is a minister.--If the sisters were elevated and possessing purity of heart, any corrupt advances, even from their minister, would be repulsed with such positiveness as would never need a repetition. Minds must be terribly befogged by Satan when they can listen to the voice of the seducer because he is a minister, and therefore break God's plain and positive commands and flatter themselves that they commit no sin. Have we not the words of John: \"He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him\"? What saith the law? \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\" When a man professing to keep God's holy law, and ministering in sacred things, takes advantage of the confidence his position gives him and seeks to indulge his base passions, this fact should of itself be sufficient to make a woman professing godliness to see that, although his profession is as exalted as the heavens, an impure proposal coming from him is from Satan disguised as an angel of light. I cannot believe that the Word of God is abiding in the\n60\nhearts of those who so readily yield up their innocency and virtue upon the altar of lustful passions.--2T 457, 458.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 59}
