{"word": "Teachers\n \n\n     Teachers can do a work of larger importance than even the minister.--The teachers for our schools should be selected from the very best class. They should be experienced Christians who are balanced in mind, men and women who have learned the lesson of self-control. Then they can educate and do a work of larger importance than even the minister in preaching the Word. They can prepare the soil that the truth may have effect upon human hearts.--13MR 95, 96.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 238}
