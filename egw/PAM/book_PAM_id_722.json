{"word": "Love for People\n \n\n     Christ identified Himself with His people.--Christ identified Himself with the necessities of His people. Their needs and their sufferings were His. He says: \"I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye clothed Me: I was sick, and ye visited Me: I was in prison, and ye came unto Me.\" God's servants should have hearts of tender affection and sincere love for the followers of Christ. They should manifest that deep interest that Christ brings to view in the care of the shepherd for the lost sheep; they should follow the example given by Christ and exercise the same compassion and gentleness, and the same tender, pitying love that He has exercised toward us.--3T 186.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 283}
