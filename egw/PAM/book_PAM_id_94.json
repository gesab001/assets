{"word": "Ministers should continually study and improve even in their later years.--The true minister of Christ should make continual improvement. The afternoon sun of his life may be more mellow and productive of fruit than the morning sun. It may continue to increase in size and brightness until it drops behind the western hills. My brethren in the ministry, it is better, far better, to die of hard work in some home or foreign mission field, than to rust out with inaction. Be not dismayed at difficulties; be not content to settle down without studying and without making improvement.--RH April 6, 1886.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 47}
