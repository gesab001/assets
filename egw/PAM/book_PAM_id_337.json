{"word": "We have a duty to minister to the poor, lame, halt, and blind.--In His conversation at the table the Lord was not speaking new truth, advancing\n142\nnew doctrines, or expounding new principles. He was repeating an old commandment which He had previously given to Moses to be given to them. He wished them to understand that His teachings in nowise lessened the force of the commandments previously given. The feasts and the suppers that were given by the priests, the Pharisees, and rulers, were given merely for selfish enjoyment. They called in their favorites, their wealthy relatives and friends, who would in their turn invite them to feasts at their houses, and, if possible, spread before them more abundant supplies. Jesus sought to extend their vision, to show them that they had a duty, which was obligatory upon them for all time, and that was to minister to the poor, the lame, the halt, and the blind. He also would have them consider the fact that no duty done to the needy, the afflicted, and the sorrowing, would lose its reward.--ST May 14, 1896.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 141}
