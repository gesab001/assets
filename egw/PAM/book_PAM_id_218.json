{"word": "95\n\n \n17: Relationships Within the Church\n \n\n     Practice patient tenderness with the faults of others.--Christ came not to be ministered unto, but to minister; and when His love reigns in the heart, we shall follow His example. If we keep uppermost in our minds the unkind and unjust acts of others, we shall find it impossible to love them as Christ has loved us; for there are few persons who do not on close acquaintance reveal unamiable traits of character. Even the best of us have these unlovely traits; and in selecting friends we should choose those who will not be driven away from us when they learn that we are not perfect. Mutual forbearance is called for. We should love and respect one another notwithstanding the faults and imperfections that we cannot help seeing; for this is the Spirit of Christ. Humility and self-distrust should be cultivated, and a patient tenderness with the faults of others. This will kill out all narrowing selfishness and make us large-hearted and generous.--ST March 5, 1885.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 95}
