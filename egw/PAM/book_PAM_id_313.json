{"word": "Do not at first urge your peculiar views too strongly.--Here is a lesson for all our ministers, colporters, and missionary workers. When you meet those, who, like Nathanael, are prejudiced against the truth, do not urge your peculiar views too strongly. Talk with them at first of subjects upon which you can agree. Bow with them in prayer, and in humble faith present your petitions at the throne of grace. Both you and they will be brought into a closer connection with heaven, prejudice will be weakened, and it will be easier to reach the heart.--Ev 446.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 132}
