{"word": "11: Personal Finance\n \n\n     Those not qualified to manage their own business affairs are not fitted to become ministers.--No man is excusable for being without financial ability. Of many a man it may be said, He is kind, amiable, generous, a good man, and a Christian, but he is not qualified to manage his own business. As far as the proper outlay of money is concerned, he is a mere child. He has not been educated by his parents to understand and practice the principles of self-support. Such a man is not fitted to become a minister.--YI Feb. 7, 1901.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 65}
