They should untiringly wrestle in prayer until the Lord blesses them. When the love of God is burning on the altar of their hearts, they will not preach to exhibit their own smartness, but to present Christ who taketh away the sins of the world.--RH Aug. 15, 1882.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 21}
