{"word": "Tithes and offerings must not be withheld by givers even if they are not in harmony with what the Conference does.--You who have been withholding your means from the cause of God, read the book of Malachi, and see what is spoken there in regard to tithes and offerings. Cannot you see that it is not best under any circumstances to withhold your tithes and offerings because you are not in harmony with everything your brethren do? The tithes and offerings are not the property of any man, but are to be used in doing a certain work for God. Unworthy ministers may receive some of the means thus raised, but dare any one, because of this, withhold from the treasury, and brave the curse of God? I dare not. I pay my tithes gladly and freely, saying, as did David, \"Of thine own have we given thee.\" A selfish withholding from God will tend to poverty in our own souls. Act your part, my brethren\n261\nand sisters. God loves you, and He stands at the helm. If the Conference business is not managed according to the order of the Lord, that is the sin of the erring ones. The Lord will not hold you responsible for it, if you do what you can to correct the evil. But do not commit sin yourselves by withholding from God his own property. \"Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord negligently,\" or deceitfully.--2SAT 74, 75.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 260}
