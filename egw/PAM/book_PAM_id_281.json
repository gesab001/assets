{"word": "Seek until you have the joy of finding.--The lesson of persevering faith and labor Christ Himself has taught us. In the parable of the lost sheep He\n118\nhas presented to our imagination no picture of a sorrowful shepherd returning without the sheep. The shepherd's search ceases not until the lost is brought back to the fold. The woman whose coin is lost searches till she finds it. These parables do not speak of failure but of success and joy in the recovery of the lost. Here is the divine guarantee that not one lost soul is overlooked, not one is left unsuccored. With all our efforts in seeking for the lost, Christ will cooperate.--AUCR July 1, 1900.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 117}
