{"word": "Those who worship should not be responseless listeners.--Through the psalmist God declares, \"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me.\" Much of the public worship of God consists of praise and prayer, and every follower of Christ should engage in this worship. There is also the preaching service, conducted by those whose work it is to instruct the congregation in the Word of God. Although all are not called to minister in word and doctrine, they need not be cold and responseless listeners. When the Word of God was spoken to the Hebrews anciently, the Lord said to Moses, \"And let all the people say, Amen.\" This response, in the fervor of their souls, was required as evidence that they understood the word spoken and were interested in it.--ST June 24, 1886.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 177}
