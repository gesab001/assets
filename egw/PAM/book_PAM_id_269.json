{"word": "The canvasser occupies a position equal to that of the gospel minister.--The canvassing work is an important field for labor; and the intelligent, God-fearing, truth-loving canvasser occupies a position equal to that of the gospel minister. Then should the canvasser feel at liberty, any more than the ordained minister, to act from selfish motives? Should he be unfaithful to all the principles of missionary work, and sell only those books that are cheapest and easiest to handle, neglecting to place before the people the books which will give most light, because by so doing, he can earn more money for himself?--TM 317, 318.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 110}
