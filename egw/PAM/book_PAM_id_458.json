{"word": "Bring no dull, complaining spirit into the prayer meeting.--Many prayers and testimonies are as destitute of the Spirit of God as a dry sponge is\n186\nof moisture; for there is no Jesus abiding in the heart. This makes the prayer-meeting cold and lifeless, and it is no wonder that children dread such seasons. Bring no dull, complaining spirit into the prayer-meeting. Do not compare notes to see how sorrowful a story you can tell. There is enough to talk about without raising one doleful strain. When we are willing to come as little children, conscious of our own weakness, and willing to be instructed by the Divine Teachers, our hearts will be filled with the love of Jesus, and we shall long to speak of his matchless worth. We shall cease to talk of self. Our trials will look so small that we shall forget to mention them. We have many blessings. Let us cultivate gratitude, and talk of the goodness of God.--ST Dec. 4, 1884.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 185}
