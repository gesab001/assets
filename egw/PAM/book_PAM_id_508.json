{"word": "34: Wedding\n \n\n     Angels attended the first wedding ceremony.--I have often read these words: \"Marriage is a lottery.\" Some act as if they believed the statement, and their married life testifies that it is such to them. But true marriage is not a lottery. Marriage was instituted in Eden. After the creation of Adam, the Lord said, \"It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him an help meet [suitable] for him\". When the Lord presented Eve to Adam, angels of God were witnesses to the ceremony. But there are few couples who are completely united when the marriage ceremony is performed. The form of words spoken over the two who take the marriage vow, does not make them a unit. In their future life is to be the blending of the two in wedlock. It may be made a real happy union, if each will give to the other true, heart affection.--10MR 184.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 201}
