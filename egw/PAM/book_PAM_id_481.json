{"word": "193\n \n \nInappropriate Illustrations\n \n\n     Many illustrations belittle the sacred dignity of preaching.--We do not want to lose sight of the peculiar sacredness of this mission of ministering in word and in doctrine to the people. It is the work of the minister to speak the words of truth to the people, solemn, sacred truth. Some form the habit of relating anecdotes in their discourses, which have a tendency to amuse and remove from the mind of the hearer the sacredness of the Word which they are handling. Such should consider that they are not giving to the people the Word of the Lord. Too many illustrations do not have a correct influence; they belittle the sacred dignity that should ever be maintained in the presentation of the Word of God to the people.--RH Feb. 22, 1887.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 193}
