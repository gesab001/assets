{"word": "Women's wages proportionate to time they give the work.--Injustice has been done to women who labor just as devotedly as their husbands, and who are recognized by God as being necessary to the work of ministry as their husbands. The method of paying men-laborers and not their wives, is a plan not after the Lord's order. Injustice is thus done. A mistake made. The Lord does not favor this plan. This arrangement, if carried out in our conferences, is liable to discourage our sisters from qualifying themselves for the work they should engage in.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 78}
