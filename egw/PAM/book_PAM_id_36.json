{"word": "Ministers must first be converted to the truth themselves.--I attended the ministerial council and made some important remarks in regard to the necessity of the ministerial school, and the importance of ministers' spending some time in obtaining a drill in Bible study, which would qualify them to do better work. Thus they would place themselves in the most favorable position to obtain a knowledge of how to work. This is necessary because there has been so much counterworking in our midst that the churches have received very confusing theories in regard to the truth for this time. It is essential that our ministers speak the same things in our churches, and give the trumpet no uncertain sound. Our ministers need first to be converted to the truth themselves. Then they can go forth everywhere, bearing the message of truth for this time.--3MR 193.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 28}
