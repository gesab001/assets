{"word": "50\n\n     A minister's problems can sometimes be best dealt with in a small group.--He was willing to go into the congregation at once and confess his sins, and his backsliding from God. He was advised that this was not wisdom, and would not result in glorifying God, but would give our enemies occasion to cast reflections upon the whole ministry. It is Satan's object to ensnare men who handle sacred things, that he may lead them to do things that will bring the ministry down on a level with common things, so that sinners may be furnished with an excuse for their own impenitence and sin. When the words and the deportment of the minister are not after the Christ's example, but are in imitation of the words and ways of the great deceiver, our enemies have occasion to blaspheme. We decided that it would meet the approval of God for a few, thirty or forty, who had heard the testimony given me of God, to be present and hear his acknowledgment of the reproof given, and hear his confession.--EGW'88 54.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 50}
