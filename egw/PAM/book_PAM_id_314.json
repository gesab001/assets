{"word": "133\n \n \nBible Studies\n \n\n     Interest awakened by preaching should be followed up by visitation and Bible studies.--A minister may enjoy sermonizing; for it is the pleasant part of the work, and is comparatively easy; but no minister should be measured by his ability as a speaker. The harder part comes after he leaves the desk, in watering the seed sown. The interest awakened should be followed up by personal labor,--visiting, holding Bible readings, teaching how to search the Scriptures, praying with families and interested ones, seeking to deepen the impression made upon hearts and consciences.--5T 255.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 133}
