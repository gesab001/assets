{"word": "48: Problem Solving and Conflict Resolution\n \n\n     Understanding the perversity of human nature, Jesus gave explicit rules for our dealing with one another.--Our Redeemer understood the perversity of human nature; and in order to save the souls for whom He sacrificed His life, and establish His church in unity and prosperity upon the earth, He has given explicit rules for church-members to follow in dealing with one another. Hear what He says: \"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, Thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.\"--RH Apr. 15, 1880.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 267}
