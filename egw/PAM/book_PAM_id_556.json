{"word": "A good shepherd will leave the 99 and seek the lost sheep.--If there is a backslider, the shepherd knows how to present the truth in such a manner that the soul will be convicted. He will leave the ninety and nine, and seek the lost sheep. But if the shepherd does not visit his flock, he knows not their condition, he knows not what truths to set before them, nor what is appropriate to their case. And more than this, as the preacher manifests so little interest in the souls under his charge, he cannot set an example to the flock to have an interest and love and watch-care for souls.--Appeal and Suggestions to Conference Officers (Ph 2)18.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 220}
