{"word": "Church discipline is a disagreeable but necessary part of ministry.--Paul charged Timothy to \"preach the Word,\" but there was yet another part to be done,--\"to reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\" This work cannot be neglected with safety. Ministers must be instant in season and out of season, watching for souls as they that must give an account. They must exercise great carefulness. Watch in all things, watch for the devices of Satan, lest you be beguiled from doing the disagreeable part of the work. Difficulties must not intimidate or discourage you. Having well-balanced minds and established characters, meet the difficulties, and in overcoming them gain a rich experience.--RH Sept. 28, 1897.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 210}
