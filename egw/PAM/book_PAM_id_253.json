{"word": "Great care should be exercised in the selection of conference presidents.--The Lord has been pleased to present before me many things in regard to the calling and labor of our ministers, especially those who have been appointed as presidents of Conferences. Great care should be exercised in the selection of men for these positions of trust. There should be earnest prayer for divine enlightenment. Those who are thus appointed as overseers of the flock should be men of good repute, men who give evidence that they have not only a knowledge of the Scriptures, but an experience in faith, in patience, that in meekness they may instruct those who oppose the truth.\n106\nThey should be men of thorough integrity; not novices, but intelligent students of the Word, able to teach others also, bringing from the treasure-house things new and old,--men who in character, in words, in deportment, will be an honor to the cause of Christ, teaching the truth, living the truth, growing up to the full stature in Christ Jesus. This means the development and strengthening of every faculty by exercise, that the workers may become qualified to bear larger responsibilities as the work increases.--GW 232.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 105}
