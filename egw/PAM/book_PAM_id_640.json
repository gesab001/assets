{"word": "Conference and Department Leaders\n \n\n     Respect treasurers, accountants, and bookkeepers.--I was shown the great deficiency there is in keeping the accounts in the various departments of the cause. Bookkeeping is and ever will be an important part of our work, and those who have become intelligent in it are greatly needed in all our institutions. . . . This branch of the work has been neglected shamefully, and altogether too long. It is a shame to allow work of such magnitude to be done in a defective, bungling manner. God wants as perfect work as it is possible for human beings to do. . . . Bookkeeping is a subject that needs to be studied in order that it may be done with correctness and dispatch and without worry and taxation.--Lt 63, 1886. (Quoted in Ellen G. White in Europe 249.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 255}
