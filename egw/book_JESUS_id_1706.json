{"word": "The Christian life is constantly an onward march. Jesus sits as a refiner and purifier of His people; and when His image is perfectly reflected in them, they are perfect and holy, and prepared for translation. A great work is required of the Christian. We are exhorted to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

Every branch in the parent vine must derive life and strength from that vine, in order to yield fruit.  1T 34015", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 51}
