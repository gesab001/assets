{"word": "Joy Through Repentance \n\n     The conditions of salvation for man are ordained of God. Self-abasement and cross-bearing are the provisions made for the repenting sinner to find comfort and peace. The thought that Jesus submitted to humiliation and sacrifice that man will never be called to endure, should hush every murmuring voice. The sweetest joy comes to man through his sincere repentance toward God because of the transgression of His law, and faith in Jesus Christ as the sinner's Redeemer and Advocate. --The Signs of the Times, March 4, 1880.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 108}
