{"word": "THE PEOPLE ARE EASILY EXCITED AND PREJUDICED UPON THE SUBJECT OF HEALTH REFORM, IF THOSE WHO HANDLE IT ARE UNFORTUNATE IN THE SELECTION OF THE OCCASION, OR IN THE STYLE IN WHICH THEY PRESENT IT, ESPECIALLY IF THEY STAND BEFORE THE PEOPLE IN THE LIGHT OF EXTREMISTS. SOME DELICATE QUESTIONS, SUCH AS \"SOLITARY VICE,\" SHOULD SELDOM, IF EVER, BE DISCUSSED, ONLY IN SUITABLE PUBLICATIONS UPON THE SUBJECT. THERE IS NOT ONE IN TEN OF OUR PREACHERS WHO ARE SUITABLY INFORMED, AND PROPERLY GUARDED, TO HANDLE THE HEALTH QUESTION IN ITS SEVERAL BRANCHES BEFORE THE PEOPLE. AND THE AMOUNT OF HARM DONE TO THE CAUSE OF PRESENT TRUTH BY THE INJUDICIOUS COURSE OF THOSE WHO HAVE INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT OF HEALTH REFORM AT THE WRONG TIME AND PLACE, AND IN A WRONG MANNER, CAN HARDLY BE ESTIMATED.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 495}
