{"word": "\"God calls upon His people to awake. There is much work to do, and no one is to say: 'We do not want this one. He will stand in our way. He will hinder us.' Cannot God take care of that? Are there not those in this congregation who will settle in London to work for the Master? Are there not those who will go to that great city as self-supporting missionaries? But while missionaries are to do all they can to be self-supporting, let those who remain here, who Sabbath after Sabbath come to the Tabernacle to hear the word of God, who have every convenience and advantage, let them beware how they say to those they send to foreign fields, destitute of every facility and advantage, 'You must be self-supporting.' . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 384}
