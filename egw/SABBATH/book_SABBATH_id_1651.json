{"word": "Facing Adversity in Rochester. [JAMES WHITE GAVE THE FOLLOWING REASONS WHY HE FELT THE PAPER SHOULD NO LONGER BE PRINTED AT THE COMMERCIAL PRINTING OFFICE IN SARATOGA SPRINGS, NEW YORK: \n     \"1. IT IS NOT CONVENIENT TO PRINT SUCH A PAPER AT A SUITABLE PRINTING-OFFICE, AND HAVE THE WORK PUT BY ON THE SEVENTH DAY, AND IT IS VERY UNPLEASANT TO US, AS WELL AS INCONVENIENT, TO HAVE THE WORK DONE ON THE SABBATH. \n     \"2. IF A SMALL OFFICE WAS OWNED BY THE BRETHREN, THE PAPER COULD BE PRINTED IN SUCH AN OFFICE FOR ABOUT THREE FOURTHS OF WHAT OTHERS CAN AFFORD TO DO IT FOR US IN LARGE PRINTING ESTABLISHMENTS. \n     \"3. WE THINK THAT HANDS CAN BE OBTAINED WHO ARE KEEPING THE SABBATH WHO WOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE PAPER THAT CANNOT BE EXPECTED OF OTHERS. IN THIS CASE, MUCH CARE WOULD BE TAKEN FROM THE ONE THAT HAD CHARGE OF IT.\"--RH, MARCH 2, 1852.]--In April, 1852, we moved to Rochester, N. Y., under most discouraging circumstances. At every step we were obliged to advance by faith. We were still crippled by poverty, and compelled to exercise the most rigid economy and self-denial. I will give a brief extract from a letter to Brother Howland's family, dated April 16, 1852:", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 23}
