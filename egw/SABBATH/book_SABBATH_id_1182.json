{"word": "\\93In a vision given me at Saratoga Springs I was shown a company in Vermont with a woman among them who was a deceiver, and the church must be enlightened as to her character lest poisonous error should become deeply rooted among them. I had not seen the brethren in that part of the State with my natural eyes. We visited them, and as we entered Brother B.'s dwelling a woman came forward to receive me whom I thought to be Sister B.'s mother. I was about to salute her when the light fell upon her face and lo! it was Mrs. C., the woman I had seen in vision. I dropped her hand instantly and drew back. She noticed this and remarked upon it afterwards. The church in Vergennes and vicinity collected together for meeting. There was confusion of sentiment among them. Brother E. E. held the age to come and some were in favor of S. Allen, a notable fanatic, who held views of a dangerous character which if carried out would lead to spiritual union and breaking up of families. I delivered the message in the Sabbath meeting which the Lord had given me. Sunday noon Mrs. C. was talking quite eloquently in regard to backbiting. She was very severe, for she had heard that speeches had been made against her fanatical proceedings. Just then Sister B. entered saying, \\91Will you please walk out to dinner?\\92 Mrs. C. instantly replied, saying, \\91This kind goeth not out save by fasting and prayer. I do not wish any dinner.\\92 In a moment my husband was upon his feet. The power of God was upon him, and the color had left his face. Said he, \\91I hope it will go out! In the name of the Lord, I hope it will go out!\\92 and said he to Mrs. C., \\91That evil spirit is in \n286\nyou, and I hope it will go out! I rebuke it in the name of the Lord!\\92 She seemed to be struck dumb. Her glib, smart tongue was stilled for once.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LS80", "page": 285}
