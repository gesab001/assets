{"word": "The Sunday party is strengthening itself in its false claims, and this will mean oppression to those who determine to keep the Sabbath of the Lord. We are to place ourselves where we can carry out the Sabbath commandment in its fullness. \"Six days shalt thou labour,\" the Lord declares, \"and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work\" (Exodus 20:9, 10). And we are to be careful not to place ourselves where it will be hard for ourselves and our children to keep the Sabbath.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 359}
