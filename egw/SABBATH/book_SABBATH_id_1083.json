{"word": "After the unpleasant interruption in our first two meetings, we felt that there was no assurance that we could hold other meetings in the same hall without similar annoyances, as the one who interrupted the meeting was the owner of the hall. Before the next Sabbath another hall had been hired, and handbills posted stating that meetings would be held Friday and Sunday evenings, and Sabbath and Sunday afternoons. The names of the speakers were not announced, but Eld. Bourdeau's name was signed to the bill. Judge of our surprise, the next morning after our bills were posted, to see other bills, the same size and style, posted by the side of ours, stating that Eld. Miles Grant would hold a series of meetings in a hall directly above ours, on the same days but at different hours. From a remark made by Eld. G. in one of his lectures, it appears that he came to Torre Pellice the same day that we did; but for some reason his arrival was kept quiet, and no announcement of his meetings was made until after our notices had appeared.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 236}
