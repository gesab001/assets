{"word": "\"We are willing to endure privations if the work of God can be advanced. We believe the Lord's hand was in our coming to this place. There is a large field for labor and but few laborers. May the Lord help us that we may move just right while here. We are earnestly striving to draw near to God, and to have our wills in subjection to the divine will. We know that the Lord wants us to be living examples, then can we enjoy the light of his countenance. Last Sabbath our meeting was excellent. The Lord refreshed us with his presence. May the Lord prosper you and the church in your place. Rely wholly upon the sure promises of God.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 161}
