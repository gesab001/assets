{"word": "The Lord's day is the seventh day, the Sabbath of creation. On the day that God sanctified and blessed, Christ signified \"by His angel unto His servant John\" things which must come to pass before the close of the world's history, and He means that we should become intelligent with regard to them. It is not in vain that He declares: \"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\" Revelation 1:9, 10, 1-3. This is the education that is to be patiently given. Let our lessons be appropriate for the day in which we live, and let our religious instruction be given in accordance with the messages God sends.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 333}
