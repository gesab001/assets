{"word": "Chap. 16 - The All-Important Lesson\n\n     If the young who are strong will put to the stretch their powers in searching the Bible, they will have minds stored with valuable knowledge that will shine as a light upon those with whom they associate. The Sabbath-school should be a place where those who have made advancement in divine knowledge should be able to inculcate fresh ideas in regard to the faith of God's people. When all those who profess to be Christians are Christians in deed and in truth, the Sabbath-school will be no longer a dry round of service. The teachers will then understand the lesson that Christ gave to Nicodemus, and will teach it in all its momentous bearing on human destiny. Jesus said to the ruler in Israel, \\93Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.\\94 Except a man be born again, he can not understand the character of the heavenly kingdom, or discern its spiritual nature. Christ was saying to Nicodemus in these words: \\93It is not learning you need so much as it is inward renovation. You need not to have your curiosity satisfied so much as to have a new heart, and until that change takes place, making all things new, it \n71\nwill result in no saving good to you for Me to discuss with you My authority, My work, My mission as One who bears the credentials of Heaven.\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 70}
