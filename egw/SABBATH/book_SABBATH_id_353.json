{"word": "Fixing the Lesson in the Memory \n\n     As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are invaluable. Let the Sabbath school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost.--Ed 251, 252.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 43}
