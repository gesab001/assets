He commenced in Heaven to war against the foundation of God's government, and since his fall has carried on his rebellion against the law of God, and has brought the mass of professed Christians to trample under their feet the fourth commandment, which brings to view the living God. He has torn down the original Sabbath of the decalogue, and instituted in its place one of the laboring days of the week.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4bSG", "page": 102}
