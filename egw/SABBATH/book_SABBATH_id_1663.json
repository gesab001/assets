{"word": "Periodicals to Be Kept Separate. [ADDRESSED TO THE GENERAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLISHING BOARDS OF THE REVIEW AND HERALD AND THE PACIFIC PRESS.]--I have received a letter from Brother T in reference to changes which it is proposed to make in the publication of our periodicals. Questions are asked in reference to these matters. One is, \"Shall our periodicals be combined in one paper or magazine?\" Brother T further says: \"Some suggest that the Review, Home Missionary, and Sabbath School Worker be combined in one paper, to be used as our regular church paper; have the Review enlarged to 32 pages and divide it up into different departments, covering the different lines of work. All three of the papers are designed especially for our own people, and I am not sure but that this combination could be effected. Some have thought that the Instructor and Little Friend could also be combined in our church paper. Another suggestion is that the Signs of the Times and the American Sentinel be combined in one pioneer missionary paper.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 228}
