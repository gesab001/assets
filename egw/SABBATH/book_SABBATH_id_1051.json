{"word": "Sabbath morning I still felt the effects of the evening's chill. For two weeks I had been suffering much from some teeth that had been improperly treated by the dentist, and the cold that I had taken not only affected my lungs and throat, but rendered the pain in my teeth almost unendurable. I felt unable to speak to the people; but my earnest prayer went up to heaven for needed strength. Again I ventured to the hall, and found it well filled with interested hearers. I spoke from John 15:1-8, on the subject of the True Vine. I was strengthened and blessed; my infirmities were forgotten in the interest I felt for precious souls. The dear Saviour seemed very near, and the Holy Spirit rested upon the assembly.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 182}
