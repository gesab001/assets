{"word": "Every human being has been placed on trial, as were Adam and Eve in Eden. As the tree of knowledge was placed in the midst of the garden of Eden, so the Sabbath command is placed in the midst of the Decalogue. In regard to the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the restriction was made, \\93Ye shall not eat of it, . . . lest ye die.\\94 Of the Sabbath, God said, Ye shall not defile it, but keep it holy. \\93Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\\94 As the tree of knowledge was the test of Adam\\92s obedience, so the fourth command is the test that God has given to prove the loyalty of all His people. The experience of Adam is to be a warning to us so long as time shall last. It warns us not to receive any assurance from the mouth of mortals or of angels that will detract one jot or tittle from the sacred law of Jehovah.\\97Review and Herald, Aug. 30, 1898.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 133}
