{"word": "Since your first efforts to keep the Sabbath, many things have arisen to discourage you; yet we hope that these things \n                                                                           490\nwill not divert your mind from the important truths for these last days. Although the advocates of the truth do not all do as they should, because they are unsanctified by the truths they profess, the truth is the same; its luster is undimmed. Although these may stand between the truth and those who have not fully taken hold upon it, and their dark shadow may appear for a time to cloud its bright luster, yet it does not in reality; the truth of heavenly origin is undimmed. Its purity and exalted character are changeless. It lives; for it is immortal.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2T", "page": 489}
