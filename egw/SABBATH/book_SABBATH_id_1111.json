{"word": "Entire Trust in God \n\n     Because of unconsecrated workers, things will sometimes go wrong. You may weep over the result of the wrong course of others, but do not worry. The work is under the supervision of the blessed Master. All He asks is that the workers shall come to Him for their orders, and obey His directions. All parts of the work--our churches, missions, Sabbath schools, institutions--are carried upon His heart. Why worry? The intense longing to see the church imbued with life must be tempered with entire trust in God. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 83}
