{"word": "Called Forward in San Francisco \n\n     Friday, December 21 [1900], I went to San Francisco, where I was to spend the Week of Prayer. Sabbath afternoon I spoke to the church there, although I was so weak that I had to cling to the pulpit with both hands to steady myself. I asked the Lord to give me strength to speak to the people. He heard my prayer, and strengthened me. I had great freedom in speaking from Revelation 2:1-5.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 151}
