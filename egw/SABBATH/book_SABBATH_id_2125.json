{"word": "We took the packet on our way to Madison County, which left us within twenty-five miles of Bro. Abbey's, where we hired a carriage to complete the journey. When we arrived at the house, it was proposed that one go to the door and make inquiries, that if we should be disappointed we could return with the driver, and would keep the Sabbath at a public house. Sr. Abbey came to the door, and my husband introduced himself as one who kept the Sabbath. Said she, \"I am glad to see you. Come in.\" He replied. \"There are three more in the carriage with me. I thought if we all came in together, we might frighten you. \"I am never frightened at Christians,\" was the reply. Heartily were we welcomed by sister A. She expressed much joy at seeing us, and when Bro. Bates was introduced she said, \"Can this be Bro. Bates, who wrote that hewing book on the Sabbath? And come to see us? I am unworthy to have you come under my roof. But \n                                                                           102\nthe Lord has sent you to us, for we are all starving for truth.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 101}
