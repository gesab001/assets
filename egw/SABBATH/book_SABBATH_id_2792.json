{"word": "Where sincere piety is lacking, where daily communion with God is neglected, the teacher in the Sabbath-school will be dry and tedious in his manner of teaching. His words will have no power to reach the hearts of his pupils. To be laborers together with God means a great deal more than merely to go to Sabbath-school, and attend the services of the church, and take part in the work of teaching, and in bearing testimony in the social service. To be a laborer together with God means that your heart is drawn out in strong desire for the salvation of the sinful souls for whom Christ has died. It means that you are filled with solicitude for the work, that you are ever planning to make your instruction interesting, to devise ways that you may draw with every intrusted power of your nature along the lines in which Christ is drawing, that souls may be won to His service and be bound to Him by the cords of His infinite love.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 67}
