{"word": "[Otsego, Michigan] Sabbath, January 8, 1859. Traveled to Meeting by Sleigh and Spoke Some.--It is the holy Sabbath. May we honor and glorify God today. We went with Brother Leighton in his sleigh to Otsego, four miles. It was very cold; could hardly keep comfortable. Found the meetinghouse not very warm. All were so cold. Must take time to get warm. \n                                                                           262\nBrother Loughborough preached upon the judgment.  Then I said a few words. Not very free. Then the church readily gave in their testimonies.--Manuscript 5, 1859.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 261}
