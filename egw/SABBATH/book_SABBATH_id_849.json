{"word": "Ministers of Jesus should stand as reprovers to those who fail to remember the Sabbath to keep it holy. They should kindly and solemnly reprove those who engage in worldly conversation upon the Sabbath, and at the same time claim to be Sabbath-keepers. They could encourage devotion to God upon his holy day.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 208}
