{"word": "This morning, Sabbath, we called in Brother Haskell and Elbert Lane and engaged in prayer for our dear Lucinda. We felt that God did not turn away our prayer, but that His ears hearkened to our petition and that He would raise up the dear child to soundness. We shall continue to hold fast the arm of God. I have faith in no other power, no other skill. It is put within me. No arm but the Lord's can bring help to Lucinda. If she is raised up it will be by the prayer of faith. Jesus is our great deliverer. If we ask Him He will hear us. We shall plead with God. I hope dear Lucinda will take hold on the promises herself and not let go. I hope she will have unwavering faith.--Letter 69, 1874.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 234}
