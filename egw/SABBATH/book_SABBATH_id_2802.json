{"word": "There was a time in the history of our work when the workers felt the necessity of counseling with those who had experience, when they realized the need of the guidance of the Lord in all that pertained to His work; but that time has passed, and the true missionary spirit has departed from the hearts of many of our professed workers. The Lord desires that those who are engaged in the Sabbath-school work should be missionaries, able to go forth to the towns and villages that surround the church, and give the light of life to those who sit in darkness. He would not have the young men feel that they must confine themselves to the Sabbath-school work to the exclusion of this missionary work, that so much needs to be done, for in making an effort for those who know not the truth, they would gain an experience that would enlarge their minds and deepen their sympathies.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 74}
