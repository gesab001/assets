{"word": "Chapter XXXI. - Covetousness.\n\n     I saw Satan and his angels consulting together. He bade his angels go and lay their snares especially for those who were looking for Christ's second appearing, and who were keeping all God's commandments. Satan told his angels that the churches were all asleep. He would increase his power and lying wonders, and he could hold them. But the sect of Sabbathkeepers we hate. They are continually working against us, and taking from us our subjects, to keep that hated law of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SG", "page": 179}
