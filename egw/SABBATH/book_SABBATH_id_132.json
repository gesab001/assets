{"word": "There is more need now than ever before that our young men and women shall be intellectually qualified for the work. Our Sabbath-schools not only need intellectual, but spiritual workers, and the mind receives its tone and efficiency by thorough discipline. By superficial study, the mind gradually loses its tone, and degenerates into imbecility, and is not capable of any taxing effort. But education prepares men to know and to do the very line of work that must at this time be done. Thorough discipline, under a wise teacher, is of more value than the natural aptitude and endowment, where there is no discipline.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CE", "page": 139}
