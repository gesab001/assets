{"word": "Listen with Candor\n\n     When asked to hear the reasons of a doctrine that you do not understand, do not condemn the message until you have given it a thorough investigation, and know from the Word of God that it \n60\nis not tenable. If I had an opportunity, I would speak to the students of every Sabbath-school in the land, lifting up my voice in earnest appeal that they go to the Word of God, seeking for truth and light. God has precious light to come to His people at this very time, and you should strive earnestly in your investigations to aim at nothing less than a thorough knowledge of every point of truth, that you may not be found in the day of God among those who have not lived by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 59}
