{"word": "I saw that God was displeased with His people for becoming surety for unbelievers. I was directed to these texts: Proverbs 22:26: \"Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.\" Proverbs 11:15: \"He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretyship is sure.\" Unfaithful stewards! They pledge that which belongs to another,\\97their heavenly Father,\\97and Satan stands ready to aid his children to wrench it out of their hands. Sabbathkeepers should not be in partnership with unbelievers. God's people trust too much to the words of strangers, and ask their advice and counsel when they should not. The enemy makes them his agents, and works through them to perplex and take from God's people.  1T 200, 201100", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 85}
