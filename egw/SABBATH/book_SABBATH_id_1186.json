{"word": "\\93\\91I then said, \\93Nathaniel you are very sick. You may die in two hours, and unless God interposes, you cannot live two days,\\94 He said, very calmly, \\93Oh, not so soon as that, I think.\\94 He immediately arose from the bed, sat in the rocking-chair, and commenced talking. He began back to the time when he was converted, and told how much he enjoyed, and how afraid he was of sinning, and then when he began to forget God, and lose the blessing, how high his hopes were raised. He \\93meant to be a man in the world, to get an education and fill some high station.\\94 And then he told how his hopes had died, as afflictions had pressed heavily upon him, and how hard it was for him to give up his expectations. He said he felt he could not have it so, he would be well, he would not yield to it. Then he spoke of his coming to Rochester. How trying it was to have us wait \n300\nupon him, and to be dependent. \\93It seemed to me,\\94 said he, \\93that the kindness of you all was more than I could bear, and I have desired to get well to pay you for all this.\\94 He then spoke of his embracing the Sabbath. Said he, \\93At first I was not willing to acknowledge the light I saw. I wished to conceal it, but the blessing of God was withheld from me until I acknowledged the Sabbath. Then I felt confidence towards God.\\94 Said he, \\93I love the Sabbath now. It is precious to me. I now feel reconciled to my sickness. I know that it is the only thing that will save me. I will praise the Lord, if he can save me through affliction.\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LS80", "page": 299}
