{"word": "While looking in the Bible for a verse for Willie to commit to memory to repeat in the Sabbath School, these words arrested my attention, \"The Lord is good. A strong hold in the time of trouble, and he knoweth them that trust in him.\" I could but weep over these words, they seemed so appropriate. The whole burden upon my mind was for my husband, and the church in Wisconsin. My husband realized the blessing of God while in Wisconsin. The Lord was to him a stronghold in time of trouble. He sustained him while he bore a decided testimony against the wild fanaticism there, and upheld him by his free Spirit.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 295}
