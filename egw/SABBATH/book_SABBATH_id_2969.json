{"word": "The heathen in their blindness bow down to idols of wood and stone. \\93These be our gods,\\94 they say. But in the fourth commandment we have the proof that our God is the true and living God. In it is the seal of His authority: \\93. . . For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it.\\94 In the heavens that declare the glory of their Maker\\97the sun, shining in its strength, giving life and beauty to all created things; the moon, and the stars, the works of His hands\\97we see the superiority of the God we worship. He is the God that \\93made the earth and the heavens.\\94\\97Bible Echo, Oct. 12, 1896.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 136}
