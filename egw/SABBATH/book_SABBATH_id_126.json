Students should ever be diligent, but they ought not to crowd their minds so as to become intellectual dyspeptics. They should not be so pressed with studies as to neglect the culture of the manners; and above all, they should let nothing interfere with their seasons of prayer, which bring them in connection with Jesus Christ, the best teacher the world has ever known. In no case should they deprive themselves of religious privileges. Many students have made their studies the first great object, and have neglected prayer, and absented themselves from the Sabbath-school and the prayer-meeting; and from neglect of religious duties they have returned to their homes backslidden from God. A most important part of their education has been neglected. That which lies at the foundation of all true knowledge should not have been made a secondary consideration. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" [Psalm 111:10.] \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.\" [Matthew 6:33.] This must not be made last, but first.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CE", "page": 28}
