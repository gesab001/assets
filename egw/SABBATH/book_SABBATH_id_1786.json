IN OUR TIME THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF ACCEPTABLE SABBATH OBSERVANCE, DRESS AND ADORNMENT, AND HEALTH REFORM. SINCE THE ISSUANCE OF THE TWO PRECEDING VOLUMES OF THIS SERIES, SOME VALUABLE MATERIALS, ALONG THESE LINES, FOUND HERE AND THERE IN ELLEN WHITE'S MANUSCRIPTS AND LETTERS OF COUNSEL, HAVE  BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE ADVENTIST REVIEW AND ARE NOW PUT INTO BOOK FORM HERE. SOME MATERIALS FROM PUBLISHED SOURCES HAVE ALSO BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FOUR CHAPTERS OF THIS SECTION.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 236}
