{"word": "Pay Fine if It Will Deliver From the Oppressor \n\n\n     Men are inspired by Satan to execute his purposes against God. The Lord has said, \"Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations\" (Exodus 31:13). None should disobey this command in order to escape persecution. But let all  consider the words of Christ, \"When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another\" (Matthew 10:23). If it can be avoided, do not put yourselves into the power of men who are worked by the spirit of Antichrist. If the  payment of a fine will deliver our brethren from the hands of these oppressors, let it be paid, rather than to be pressed and made to work on the Sabbath. Everything that we can do should be done that those who are willing to suffer for the truth's sake may be saved from oppression and cruelty. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 400}
