{"word": "All in the school should feel themselves learners. We are to become daily learners if we would be true educators. It is a noble thing to teach; it is a blessed thing to learn. Knowledge is a precious possession, and the more we obtain of it, the better work will we do if we make a right use of it. As workers for God we want more of Jesus and less of self. We should have more of a burden for souls, and should pray daily that strength and wisdom may be given us for the Sabbath. Teachers, meet with your classes. Pray with them, and \n20\nteach them how to pray. Let the heart be softened, and the petitions short and simple, but earnest. Let your words be few and well chosen; and let them learn from your lips and your example that the truth of God must be rooted in their hearts or they can not stand the test of temptation. We want to see whole classes of young people being converted to God, and growing up useful members of the church.\\97S. S. W., October, 1885.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 19}
