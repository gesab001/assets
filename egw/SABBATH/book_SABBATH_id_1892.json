{"word": "11-17 (ch. 14:9-12; Daniel 7:25; 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4; see EGW on Revelation 17:13, 14; 18:1-5). Persecuting Hand of the Enemy.--[Revelation 13:11-13 quoted.] Religious powers, allied to heaven by profession and claiming to have the characteristics of a lamb, will show by their acts that they have the heart of a dragon, and that they are instigated and controlled by Satan. The time is coming when God's people will feel the hand of persecution because they keep holy the seventh day. Satan has caused the change of the Sabbath in the hope of carrying out his purpose for the defeat of God's plans. He seeks to make the commands of God of less force in the world than human laws.", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 975}
