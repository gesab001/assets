{"word": "Personal Work for Class Members \n\n\n     Our teachers need to be converted men and women, who know what it means to wrestle with God, who will not be at rest until the hearts of the children \n                                                                           75\nare turned to love, praise, and glorify God. Who will be earnest workers for souls in our Sabbath schools? Who will take the youth separately, and talk and pray with them, and make personal appeals to them, beseeching them to yield their heart to Jesus, that they may be as a sweet savor to Christ? As we view the magnitude of the work, and see how little it is appreciated, we feel like groaning in spirit, and exclaiming, Who will accept these grave responsibilities, and watch for souls as they that must give an account? We are Christ's representatives upon the earth. How do we fulfill our mission? Christ's representatives will be in daily communion with Him. Their words will be select, their speech seasoned with grace, their hearts filled with love, their efforts sincere, earnest, persevering, to save souls for whom Christ has died. Let all do their utmost to work for the salvation of the dear children and youth, and by and by they will listen with joy to the words of Jesus, \"Well done, good and faithful servant; . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" What is this joy? It is beholding the redeemed saints saved through their instrumentality, through the blood of Jesus Christ.--TSS 15.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 74}
