{"word": "The Sabbath was not for Israel merely, but for the world. It had been made known to man in Eden, and, like the other precepts of the Decalogue, it is of imperishable obligation. Of that law of which the fourth commandment forms a part, Christ declares, \\93Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.\\94 Matthew 5:18. So long as the heavens and the earth endure, the Sabbath will continue as a sign of the Creator\\92s power. And when Eden shall bloom on earth again, God\\92s holy rest day will be honored by all beneath the sun. \\93From one sabbath to another\\94 the inhabitants of the glorified new earth shall . . . \\93worship before me, saith the Lord.\\94\\97DA 283 quoted in FLB 37.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 142}
