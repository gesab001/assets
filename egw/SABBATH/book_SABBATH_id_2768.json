The teachers would not be devoid of spiritual grace and power, for they would have a realization of the divine presence; they would understand that they were but the human agents through whom Christ was imparting His heavenly light. Their labors would be instinct with earnestness and power, and they would know that the Spirit helpeth their infirmities.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 43}
