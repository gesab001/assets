{"word": "Dear sister, it is for us to be patient, to choose the suffering part of religion. Your own precious child may not discern the mystery of godliness and may think you stubborn and foolish, that you will be odd and singular from the world. But faint not. If [you are] faithful to duty, God may touch the heart of your child and she may see the matchless charms of a Saviour's love. To the unbeliever whose happiness is in the things of the world, its pleasures and its vanities, the conscientious observers of the Lord's Sabbath seem wild and erratic. They may inquire why the great men, the ministers, the doctors, and the learned do not see these things if they are indeed the truth. Because of the cross!  Popularity and worldly inducements are considerations too great for them to yield up. They have their minds darkened by the god of this world. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 232}
