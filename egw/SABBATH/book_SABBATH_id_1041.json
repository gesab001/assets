{"word": "Labors in England\n     The first two weeks after we landed in Liverpool we spent in visiting among the churches and unorganized companies of Sabbath-keepers in England. At Grimsby we found the mission, or office of the Present Truth, occupying a convenient, well lighted, and pleasantly located building. All the work on the paper, except the press-work, is done in this building, and most of the workers live here. There is also in the house a good-sized room which is used for meetings. We believe that the time will soon come when it will be necessary to secure a larger building, and to purchase a press upon which to print the paper, as well as books and tracts, so that the light may shine forth in more distinct rays to every part of the kingdom.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 162}
