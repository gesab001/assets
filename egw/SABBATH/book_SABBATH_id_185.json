{"word": "Cease to Worry \n\n     Things will go wrong because of unconsecrated workers. You may shed tears over the result of this; but don't worry. The blessed Master has all His work from end to end under His masterly supervision. All He asks is that the workers shall come to Him for their orders, and obey His directions. Everything--our churches, our missions, our Sabbath schools, our institutions--is carried upon His divine heart. Why worry? The intense longing to see the church a living and shining light as God designs it shall be, must be tempered with entire trust in God.--Review and Herald, Nov. 14, 1893.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 243}
