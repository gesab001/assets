{"word": "A New Element\n\n    A new element  must be brought into our Sabbath-school work in every church, not an element of contention, but one of piety and purity. Self-esteem and self-sufficiency are so prevalent that the words of the True Witness apply to many members of the Sabbath-school. The True Witness says: \\93I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of My mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked; I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes \n57\nwith eye-salve, that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent.\\94", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 56}
