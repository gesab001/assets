{"word": "We know of no better place in Europe for us to educate workers than right here in Basle. The new office affords an excellent opportunity for \n172\npersons to learn various branches of the work, and we would like to see scores of young men and women connected with the office, drilling for the Master's service. We believe that the time is not far distant when a school will be connected with the work here, so that workers may be more thoroughly prepared to go forth as missionaries, and also that those of our brethren who have children may have a place to send them where they will not be obliged to attend school on the Sabbath. We are grateful that some efforts are now being made to train young people to go forth as soldiers of the cross of Christ to war against the enemies of truth. But we regret that these efforts are so crippled because of our limited means.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 171}
