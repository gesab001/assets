STARR'S COMMENTS AT ELLEN \n         WHITE'S ELMSHAVEN FUNERAL SERVICE \n\n\n     IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO SPEAK OF SOME OF THE PHASES OF THE LIFE OF SISTER WHITE.  I HAVE KNOWN HER NEARLY 40 YEARS, AND MRS. STARR HAS KNOWN HER OVER 50 YEARS.  WE HAVE LEARNED FROM HER OWN LIPS THE STORY OF HER EARLY CONVERSION AT THE AGE OF 13 YEARS, FROM DOUBT AND DARKNESS INTO LIGHT AND SPECIAL LOVE FOR THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST.  I THINK I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANY OTHER PERSON SPEAK OF LOVE FOR JESUS, PERSONAL LOVE, AS I HAVE HEARD HER SPEAK.  MANY TIMES, IN LARGE CONGREGATIONS, I HAVE HEARD HER BREAK FORTH IN THE EXPRESSION, \"JESUS, I LOVE YOU; I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU!\"  SOME HERE KNOW THAT; THEY HAVE HEARD IT; AND IT HAS THRILLED THE AUDIENCE.  WE HAVE FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THAT LOVE FOR JESUS.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "RY", "page": 216}
