{"word": "Shall Ministers Adopt Children.--The question has been asked whether a minister's wife should adopt infant children. I answer: If she has no inclination or fitness to engage in missionary work outside her home, and feels it her duty to take orphan children and care for them, she may do a good work. But let the choice of children be first made from among those who have been left orphans by Sabbathkeeping parents. God will bless men and women as they with willing hearts share their homes with these homeless ones.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 234}
