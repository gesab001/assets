{"word": "The Sabbath School Lesson \n\n     The Sabbath school affords to parents and children an opportunity for the study of God's word. But in order for them to gain that benefit which they should gain in the Sabbath school, both parents and children should devote time to the study of the lesson, seeking to obtain a thorough knowledge of the facts presented and also of the spiritual truths which these facts are designed to teach. We should especially impress upon the minds of the youth the importance of seeking the full significance of the scripture under consideration.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 137}
