{"word": "[Walling's Mills] Friday, September 12, 1873. Entertained a Non-Adventist.--We arrived home a little before sundown. Received letters from Brother Canright, also Mary Gaskill and Daniel Bourdeau, giving us an account of camp meeting. When we reached home we found John Cranson there. We felt sorry that \n                                                                           265\nhe should come to see us on the Sabbath. We do not like to have visitors to entertain upon the Sabbath who have no respect for God or His holy day.--Manuscript 11, 1873.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 264}
