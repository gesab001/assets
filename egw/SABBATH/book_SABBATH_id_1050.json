{"word": "The Sabbath Meetings\n     It was with difficulty that I could speak at the meeting of Friday evening, for the hall was cold and very damp. In this building the plaster had been put directly onto the brick walls, leaving no air chamber, and thus permitted the dampness of the wall to be communicated to the room. There had been no fire in the hall during the season, until a few hours before we assembled, and then it only served to draw out the dampness, and render the atmosphere humid. There was a penetrating chill in the air, that made one shiver in the warmest wrappings. I suffered much from pain in my lungs, while I was speaking, and for hours afterward.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 182}
