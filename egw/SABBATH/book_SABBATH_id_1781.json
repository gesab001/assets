{"word": "Ellen White's Appraisal on the Closing Day \n\n\n   (Written to a member of her home family, November 4, \n                        1888) \n\n\n     Our meeting [The Minneapolis General Conference session] is closed. I have on last Sabbath given my last discourse. There seemed for the first time to be considerable feeling in the congregation. I called them forward for prayers although the church was densely packed. Quite a number came forward. The Lord gave me the spirit of supplication and His blessing came upon me. I did not go out to meeting this morning. This has been a most laborious meeting for Willie, and I have had to watch at every point lest there should be moves made, resolutions passed, that would prove detrimental to the future work.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 177}
