{"word": "When all those who profess to be Christians are Christians in deed and in truth, the Sabbath school will be no longer a dry round of service. The teachers will then understand the lesson that Christ gave to Nicodemus, and will teach it in all its momentous bearing on human destiny. Jesus said to the ruler in Israel, \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Except a man be born again, he cannot understand the character of the heavenly kingdom, or discern its spiritual nature. Christ was saying to Nicodemus in these words:", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 64}
