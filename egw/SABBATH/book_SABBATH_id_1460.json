{"word": "The Observance of the Sabbath \n\n     Genuine medical missionary work is bound up inseparably with the keeping of God's commandments, of which the Sabbath is especially mentioned, since it is the great memorial of God's creative work. Its observance is bound up with the work of restoring the moral image of God in man. This is the ministry which God's people are to carry forward at this time. This ministry, rightly performed, will bring rich blessings to the church. --6T 266.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 214}
