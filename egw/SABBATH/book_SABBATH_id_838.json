{"word": "To us as to Israel the Sabbath is given \"for a perpetual covenant.\" To those who reverence His holy day the Sabbath is a sign that God recognizes them as His chosen people. It is a pledge that He will fulfill to them His covenant. Every soul who accepts the sign of God's government places himself under the divine, everlasting covenant. He fastens himself to the golden chain of obedience, every link of which is a promise.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 156}
