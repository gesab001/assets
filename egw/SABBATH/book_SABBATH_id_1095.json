{"word": "If you go forward toward heaven, the world will rub hard against you. . . . Earthly authorities will interpose. You will meet tribulations, bruising of the spirit, hard speeches, ridicule, persecutions. Men will require your conformity to laws and customs that would render you disloyal to God. Here is where God's people find the cross in the way to life. But if the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is sacred, if it is indeed, as brought to view in the third angel's message, the sign between God and His people, we must be careful in every word and in every act to show God honor. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 151}
