{"word": "\\93Well,\\94 says one, \\93if it were convenient, I would keep the Sabbath; but as it is, there is too great a cross connected with it.\\94 Paul says, \\93God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.\\94 Here is a double crucifixion. As the conscientious Christian takes his stand upon Bible truth, there are always those who refuse to accept it, and choose the world. The wife may take her position in favor of truth, while the husband may oppose it. Here a trial comes in at once, the trial of separation in faith and feeling. Shall we say to that wife, \\93You should leave your husband because he does not keep the Sabbath?\\94 No, indeed. If she was a faithful wife before she accepted the truth, and if she sees in her friends those for whom Christ has died, she will seek to discharge her duties with even greater fidelity after she accepts the truth, that if possible she may lead them to see the light. \\93But,\\94 it is asked, \\93should not the believing wife yield her convictions of duty because of her husband's unbelief?\\94 By no means; because Christ is her Lord and Master. She cannot cast aside the claims of high Heaven upon her. The same is true of the believing husband or child.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 232}
