{"word": "The Sabbath-School\n     Do not let the Sabbath-schools degenerate into a mere mechanical routine. We should not seek to imitate Sunday-schools, nor keep up the interest by offering prizes. The offering of rewards will create rivalry, envy, and jealousy; and some who are the most diligent and worthy, will receive little credit. Pupils should not try to see how many verses they can learn to repeat; for this brings too great a strain upon the ambitious child, while the rest become discouraged.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 408}
