{"word": "The Sabbath is a golden clasp that unites God and His people. But the Sabbath command has been broken. God\\92s holy day has been desecrated. The Sabbath has been torn from its place by the man of sin, and a common working day has been exalted in its stead. A breach has been made in the law, and this breach is to be repaired. The true Sabbath is to be exalted to its rightful position as God\\92s rest day.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 141}
