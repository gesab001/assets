{"word": "Before entering the Promised Land, the Israelites were admonished by Moses to \"keep the sabbath day to sanctify it\" (Deuteronomy 5:12). The Lord designed that by a faithful observance of the Sabbath command, Israel should continually be reminded of their accountability to Him as their Creator and their Redeemer. While they should keep the Sabbath in the proper spirit, idolatry could not exist; but should the claims of this precept of the Decalogue be set aside as no longer binding, the Creator would be forgotten and men would worship other gods.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 137}
