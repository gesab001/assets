{"word": "The Transforming Power of Religion \n\n     Oh, that every man, woman, and child who deals with human minds, may have the truth inwrought in the soul, that it may be revealed in spirit, in word, in character, and in action! The sanctifying power of the truth should lead every one who teaches in the Sabbath school, or holds a position in our institutions, to have such an experience that he may say, \"I know whom I have believed.\" There is transforming power in the religion of Jesus Christ, and this power must be seen upon us in far greater humility, in more earnest, living faith, that we may become a light to the world. Self must be humiliated, and Christ exalted. Why is it that those to whom God entrusts some work in His moral vineyard are so easily lifted up? \n                                                                           111", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 110}
