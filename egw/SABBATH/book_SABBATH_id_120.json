{"word": "There are those who hold that the Sabbath was given only for the Jews; but God has never said this. He committed the Sabbath to His people Israel as a sacred trust, but the very fact that the desert of Sinai, and not Palestine, was the place selected by Him in which to proclaim His law reveals that He intended it for all humankind. The law of Ten Commandments is as old as creation. Therefore the Sabbath institution has no special relation to the Jews, any more than to all other created beings. God has made the observance of the Sabbath obligatory upon all people. \\93The Sabbath,\\94 it is plainly stated, \\93was made for man.\\94 Let everyone, therefore, who is in danger of being deceived on this point give heed to the Word of God rather than the assertions of humans. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 355}
