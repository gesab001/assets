{"word": "Every Moment Golden \n\n     If those who are engaged in the work of God are Christians individually, their works will reveal the fact. They will present Christ to those with whom they come in contact. Teachers in Sabbath school will not occupy the time in unimportant matters, for they will realize that every moment is golden, and should be employed in working with all diligence in the garden of the Lord. The work of Christ in the sanctuary above, presenting His own blood each moment before the mercy seat, as He makes intercession for us, should have its full impression upon the heart, that we may realize the worth of each moment. Jesus ever liveth to make intercession for us; but one moment carelessly spent can never be recovered.
