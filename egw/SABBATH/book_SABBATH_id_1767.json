{"word": "Bearing Testimony Unexpectedly.--Sabbath morning early, I went into meeting and the Lord gave me a testimony directly to them, all unexpected to me. I poured it out upon them, showing them that the Lord sent His ministers with a message and the message they brought was the very means God had ordained to reach them, but they felt at liberty to pick it in pieces and make of none effect the Word of God. . . . I can tell you there was great astonishment and marveling that I dared to speak to them thus.--Letter 19, 1884.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 54}
