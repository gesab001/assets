{"word": "Jesus left the royal courts of heaven, clothed his divinity with humanity, and for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich. The question with him was not, Is it convenient for me to do this? Neither should it be with us, Is it convenient to obey God and keep the Sabbath? The question rather should be, Is it duty? What say the Scriptures? The Lord says in the words of my text, \\93Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.\\94 Again the promise is made, \\93If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words; then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\\94", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 233}
