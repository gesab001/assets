{"word": "The Greatest Danger \n\n     I was shown that there is no lack of means among Sabbathkeeping Adventists. At present their greatest danger is in their accumulations of property. Some are continually increasing their cares and labors; they are overcharged. The result is, God and the wants of His cause are nearly forgotten by them; they are spiritually dead. They are required to make a sacrifice to God, an offering. A sacrifice does not increase, but decreases and consumes. . . . Much of the means among our people is only proving an injury to those who are holding on to it.--1T 492.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CS", "page": 153}
