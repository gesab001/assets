{"word": "In the ark was the golden pot of manna, Aaron\\92s rod that budded, and the tables of stone, which folded together like a book. Jesus opened them, and I saw the ten commandments written on them with the finger of God. On one table were four, and on the other six. The four on the first table shone brighter than the other six. But the fourth, the Sabbath commandment, shone above them all; for the Sabbath was set apart to be kept in honor of God\\92s holy name. The holy Sabbath looked glorious\\97a halo of glory was all around it. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 159}
