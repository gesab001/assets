{"word": "But spies were continually upon the track of Jesus, watching for some occasion to accuse and condemn him. When they saw this act of the disciples, they immediately complained to him, saying, \"Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day.\" In this they expressed their own narrow views of the law. But Jesus defended his followers thus: \"Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was a hungered, he, and they that were with him? how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? And he said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 196}
