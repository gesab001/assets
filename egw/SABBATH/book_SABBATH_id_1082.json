{"word": "Several times while I was speaking he tried to restate my remarks, giving them just the meaning that he wished them to have, and that he has since given them; and as many times he was corrected by persons present who understood both French and English. [NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT HIS MISSTATEMENTS OF MY POSITION WERE REPEATEDLY CORRECTED AT THE MEETING, THIS MAN HAS SINCE STATED PUBLICLY THAT AT FIRST MY RESPONSE WAS EVASIVE; BUT THAT AS HE INSISTED I BECAME AFFIRMATIVE, THEN NEGATIVE, AS FOLLOWS: \\93IF THE CHRISTIAN IS PERSUADED THAT HE OUGHT TO KEEP THE SABBATH, THE SABBATH IS NECESSARY TO HIS SALVATION. IF HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IT DUTY TO KEEP THE SABBATH, THE SABBATH IS NOT NECESSARY TO HIS SALVATION.\\94 THIS IS A GROSS MISREPRESENTATION, AS WILL BE SEEN BY COMPARING IT WITH THE FACTS AS GIVEN ABOVE; BUT TO JUST SUCH MISREPRESENTATIONS WILL THOSE RESORT WHO OPPOSE THE TRUTH.] He then began to read and comment upon something which he had written in regard to the Sabbath. But he proceeded so rapidly that he gave little opportunity for his remarks to be interpreted, and therefore I could get but little idea of what he was trying to say. One statement which I did understand, however, was to the effect that Christ, instead of teaching the Sabbath, broke it. To this I felt that I must respond. I said: \\93I hope our brother will not place himself on the side of the Pharisees in their accusations against Christ; for if their charge of Sabbath-breaking could have been sustained against him, they would not have been under the necessity of hiring false witnesses to testify against him.\\94 At this he became very much enraged, and charged me with calling him a Pharisee. This, however, was corrected by several persons present, and he said, \\93I beg pardon.\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 235}
