{"word": "There are many children who plead a lack of time as a reason why their Sabbath-school lessons are not learned; but there are few who could not find time to learn their lessons if they had an interest in them. Some devote time to amusement and sight-seeing; others, to the needless trimming of their dresses for display, thus cultivating pride and vanity. The precious hours thus prodigally spent are God's time, for which they must render an account to Him. The hours spent in needless ornamentation, or in amusements and idle conversation, will, with every work, be brought into judgment.\\97T., vol. 3, pp. 188, 189.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 8}
