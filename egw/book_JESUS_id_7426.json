{"word": "Said Jesus to His disciples: \"Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" I would plead with those who have accepted the position of teachers, to first become humble learners, and ever to remain as pupils in the school of Christ to receive from the Master lessons of meekness and lowliness of heart. Humility of spirit, combined with earnest activity, will result in the salvation of souls so dearly purchased by the blood of Christ. . . . \"Faith without works is dead.\" He needs that faith that works by love and purifies the soul. A living faith in Christ will bring every action of the life and every emotion of the soul into harmony with God's truth and righteousness.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 188}
