    "word": "But had God lost all care for His people that He should leave them to destruction? Would He not warn them of their danger and deliver them from their enemies?

And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord.\"",
