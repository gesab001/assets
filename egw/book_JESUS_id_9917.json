{"word": "There is need today of such a revival of true heart-religion as was experienced by ancient Israel. We need, like them, to bring forth fruit meet for repentance,\\97to put away our sins, cleansing the defiled temple of the heart that Jesus may reign within. There is need of prayer\\97earnest, prevailing prayer. Our Saviour has left precious promises for the truly penitent petitioner. Such shall not \n117\nseek His face in vain. He has also by His own example taught us the necessity of prayer. Himself the Majesty of Heaven, He often spent all night in communion with His Father. If the world\\92s Redeemer was not too pure, too wise, or too holy to seek help from God, surely weak, erring mortals have every need of that divine assistance. With penitence and faith, every true Christian will often seek \\93the throne of grace, that he may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\\94(Signs of the Times, January 26, 1882.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 116}
