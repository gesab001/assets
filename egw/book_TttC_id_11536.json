But, my brother, you must remember that these perplexities and annoyances are included in the \"all things\" that work together for good to those who love God. The Lord's eye is upon you, and He beholds those who would misrepresent you and tear you to pieces. But if you will be of good courage, if you will stay your soul upon God, if you will trust your heavenly Father as a child trusts its parent, if you will deal justly and love mercy, God can and will work with you. His promise is sure: \"Them that honor Me I will honor.\" 1 Samuel 2:30.",
