{"word": "Those who are so curious to find out things that have not been made known in the Scriptures are generally surface students in regard to those things which have a bearing on the daily life and practice. . . . We are to reveal to the world that which God has seen necessary to reveal to us. We are not doing the will of our heavenly Father when we speculate upon things which He has seen fit to withhold from us. It is the privilege of everyone to reveal to others that he appreciates the worth of divine truths, that he appreciates the treasures of eternal life, by making every sacrifice to obtain the reward.--Manuscript 104, 1898.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 627}
