{"word": "Behold your Helper, Jesus Christ. Welcome Him, and invite His gracious presence. Your mind may be renewed day by day, and it is your privilege to accept peace and rest, rise above worries, and praise God for your blessings. Do not erect barriers of objectionable things to keep Jesus away from your soul. Change your voice; repine not; let gratitude be expressed for the great love of Christ that has been and is still being shown toward you.--Lt 294, 1906.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 68}
