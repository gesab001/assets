{"word": "Remembering Our Own Childhood Experience \n\n\n     Some parents--and some teachers, as well--seem to forget that they themselves were once children. They are dignified, cold, and unsympathetic. Wherever they are brought in contact with the young,--at home, in the day school, the Sabbath school, or the church,-- they maintain the same air of authority, and their faces habitually wear a solemn, reproving expression. \n                                                                           177\nChildish mirth or waywardness, the restless activity of the young life, finds no excuse in their eyes. Trifling misdemeanors are treated as grave sins. Such discipline is not Christlike. Children thus trained fear their parents or teachers, but do not love them; they do not confide to them their childish experiences. Some of the most valuable qualities of mind and heart are chilled to death, as a tender plant before the wintry blast.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 176}
