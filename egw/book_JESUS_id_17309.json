{"word": "In Paul's epistle to the Philippians, he says, \"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ\" (Philippians 1:1-6). Let us all make this spirit ours.--Manuscript 187, Oct. 18, 1898, diary.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 300}
