    "word": "A Time of Preparation \n\n     We are living in the great antitypical day of atonement. We must individually seek God. This is a personal work. Let us draw near to God, allowing nothing to come into our efforts that would misrepresent the truth for this time. Let everyone confess, not his brother's sin, but his own sin. Let him humble his heart before God and become so filled with the Holy Spirit that his life will show that he has been born again. We read: \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\" John 1:12.",
