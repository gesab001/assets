{"word": "It is our privilege to contemplate Jesus by faith, and see Him standing between humanity and the eternal throne. He is our Advocate, presenting our prayers and offerings as spiritual sacrifices to God. Jesus is the great, sinless propitiation, and through His merit, God and man may hold converse together. Christ has carried His humanity into eternity. He stands before God as the representative of our race.--The Youth's Instructor, Oct. 28, 1897.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "7ABC", "page": 488}
