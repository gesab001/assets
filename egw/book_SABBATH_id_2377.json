{"word": "Chap. 96 - Life Insurance\n\n     I was shown that Sabbathkeeping Adventists should not engage in life insurance. This is a commerce with the world which God does not approve. Those who engage in this enterprise are uniting with the world, while God calls His people to come out from among them and to be separate. Said the angel: \"Christ has purchased you by the sacrifice of His life. \n                                                                           550\n'What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.' 'For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.'\" Here is the only life insurance which heaven sanctions.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1T", "page": 549}
