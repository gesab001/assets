{"word": "There is constant need of private communion with God. We must take in the spirit of Christ if we would impart it to others. We cannot meet satanic and human agencies combined unless we spend much time in intercourse with the Source of all strength. There are times when we should get away from the sounds of earthly toil and human voices, and in retired places listen to the voice of Jesus. Thus we may taste of His love and imbibe His spirit. Thus we shall learn to crucify self. This course of action may seem impossible to the human mind. \\93I have not time,\\94 you may say. But when you consider the matter as it really is, you lose no time; for when you secure the power and grace that come alone from God, you do not accomplish the work. It is Jesus who is the real worker. \\93Without me,\\94 says Christ, \\93ye can do nothing.\\94 John 15:5. . . . Reflection and earnest prayer will inspire to holy endeavor.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 98}
