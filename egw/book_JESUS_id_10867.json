{"word": "As many are today, so (before his conversion) Paul was very confident in an hereditary piety; but his confidence was founded on falsehood. It was faith out of Christ, for he trusted in forms and ceremonies. His zeal for the law was disconnected from Christ and was valueless. His boast was that he was blameless in his performance of the deeds of the law; but the Christ who made the law of any value he refused. He was confident that he was right. He says: \"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them\" (Acts 26:9, 10). For a time Paul did a very cruel work, thinking that he was doing God service; for he says, \"I did it ignorantly in unbelief\" (1 Timothy 1:13). But his sincerity did not justify his work, or make error truth.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 346}
