{"word": "Christ's Example \n\n     In his earth life Christ was an example to all the human family, and He was obedient and helpful in the home. He learned the carpenter's trade, and worked with His own hands in the little shop at Nazareth. . . . The Bible says of Jesus, \"The Child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.\" Luke 2:40. As He worked in childhood and youth, mind and body were developed. He did not use His physical powers recklessly, but in such a way as to keep them in health, that He might do the best work in every line. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 147}
