Some of those who were in darkness received the light and rejoiced; while others resisted the light from heaven, and said that it was deception to lead them astray. The light passed away from them, and they were left in darkness. Those who had received the light from Jesus, joyfully cherished the increase of precious light which was shed upon them. Their faces lighted up, \n                                                                           145\nand beamed with holy joy, while their gaze was directed upward to Jesus with intense interest, and their voices were heard in harmony with the voice of the angel, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come.

Discouragement settled upon them, and those men I had before noticed, the ministers and leading men, rejoiced. Those who had rejected the light, triumphed greatly, while Satan and his evil angels also exulted around them.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SG", "page": 144}
