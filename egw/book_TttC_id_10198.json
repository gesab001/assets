    "word": "We trust that our publishing house in Australia will make liberal terms in the publication of Christ's Object Lessons. The Lord has greatly blessed this institution, and it should present to Him a thank offering by making no stinted donation toward freeing the school from debt. We feel sure that it will take up the work and act its part nobly. And this co-operation with God will prove to the Australian publishing house as great a blessing as it has proved to our institutions in America.",
