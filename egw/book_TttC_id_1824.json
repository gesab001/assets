    "word": "God calls for separation from the world. Will you obey? Will you come out from among them, and remain separate and distinct from them? \"For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?\" You cannot mingle with worldlings, and partake of their spirit, and follow their example, and be at the same time a child of God. The Creator of the universe addresses you as an affectionate Father. If you separate from the world in your affections, and remain free from its contamination, escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust, God will be your Father, He will adopt you into His family, and you will be His heir. In place of the world, He will give you, for a life of obedience, the kingdom under the whole heavens. He will give you an eternal weight of glory and a life that is as enduring as eternity.",
