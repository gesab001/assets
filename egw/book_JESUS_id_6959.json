{"word": "\\93While bowed at the altar with others who were seeking the Lord, all the language of my heart was: \\91Help, Jesus, save me or I perish! I will never cease to entreat till my prayer is heard and my sins forgiven!\\92 I felt my needy, helpless condition as \n143\nnever before. As I knelt and prayed, suddenly my burden left me and my heart was light. At first a feeling of alarm came over me and I tried to resume my load of distress again. It seemed to me that I had no right to feel joyous and happy. But Jesus seemed very near me. I felt able to come to him with all my griefs, misfortunes and trials, even as the needy ones came to him for relief when he was upon earth. There was a surety in my heart that he understood my peculiar trials and sympathized with me. I can never forget this precious assurance of the pitying tenderness of Jesus toward one so unworthy of his notice. I learned more of the divine character of Christ in the short period when bowed among the praying ones than ever before.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LS88", "page": 142}
