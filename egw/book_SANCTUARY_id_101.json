{"word": "\"Everyone that is of the truth,\" Christ declared, \"heareth My voice.\" John 18:37. Having stood in the counsels of God, having dwelt in the everlasting heights of the sanctuary, all elements of truth were in Him and of Him. He was one with God. It means more than finite minds can comprehend to present in every missionary effort Christ and Him crucified. \"He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.\" Isaiah 53:5. \"He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made \n                                                                           23\nthe righteousness of God in Him.\" 2 Corinthians 5:21. Christ crucified for our sins; Christ risen from the dead; Christ ascended on high as our intercessor--this is the science of salvation that we need to learn and to teach. This is to be the burden of our work.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 22}
