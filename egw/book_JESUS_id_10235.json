{"word": "Christ Himself, when contending with Satan about the body of Moses, \"durst not bring against him a railing accusation\" (Jude 9). Had He done this, He would have placed Himself on Satan's ground, for accusation is the weapon of the evil one. He is called in Scripture, \"the accuser of our brethren\" (Revelation 12:10). Jesus would employ none of Satan's weapons. He met him with the words, \"the Lord rebuke thee\" (Jude 9).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 70}
