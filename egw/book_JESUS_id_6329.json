{"word": "Oh that I could impress upon all the importance of exercising faith moment by moment, and hour by hour! We \n131\nare to live the life of faith; for \\93without faith it is impossible to please God.\\94 Our spiritual strength depends upon our faith, When I know this, how can I keep silent upon this subject? The world's Redeemer says, \\93According to your faith be it unto you.\\94 When you settle down in gloom and despondency, you sin against God; because it shows that you have not faith in Jesus. It shows to those around you that you do not take God at his word. When he has done so much to evince his love for you, how great this sin must appear in his sight! \\93He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\\94", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 130}
