    "word": "I saw that the least that has been required of Christians in past days, is to possess a spirit of liberality, and to consecrate to the Lord a portion of all their increase.

But Christians who are living in the last days, and who are waiting for their Lord, are required to do even more than this. God requires them to sacrifice.",
