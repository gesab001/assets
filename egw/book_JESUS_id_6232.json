{"word": "DO NOT SPECULATE ABOUT WHEN THE END WILL COME.\\97The times and the seasons God has put in His own power. And why has not God given us this knowledge? Because we would not make a right use of it if He did. A condition of things would result from this knowledge among our people that would greatly retard the work of God in preparing a people to stand in the great day that is to come. We are not to live upon time excitement. We are not to be engrossed with speculations in regard to the times and the seasons which God has not revealed. Jesus has told His disciples to \\93watch,\\94 but not for a definite time. His followers are to be in the position of those who are listening for the orders of their Captain; they are to watch, wait, pray, and work, as they approach the time for the coming of the Lord; but no one will be able to predict just when that time will come; for \\93of that day and hour knoweth no man.\\94 You will not be able to say that He will come in one, two, or five years, neither are you to put off His coming by stating that it may not be for ten or twenty years.\\97RH March 22, 1892 quoted in 1SM 189.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 166}
