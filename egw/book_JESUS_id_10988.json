Are you seeking to save the souls of your companions? Is that the object of your association with them? Do they see and feel that there is in you a living embodiment of the Spirit of Christ? Is it manifest that you are a witness for Christ, that you belong to a peculiar people, zealous of good works? Is it manifest that your life is governed by the divine precepts, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\" (Matthew 22:37), and, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour \n                                                                           126\nas thyself\" (Matthew 19:19)?

But where do your fluency and warmth of speech show that your interest is centered?", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 125}
