{"word": "At the termination of the 2300 days, in 1844, no sanctuary had existed on earth for many centuries; therefore the sanctuary in Heaven must be the one brought to view in the declaration, \"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\" But how could a sanctuary in Heaven need cleansing? Turning again to the Scriptures, the students of prophecy learned that the cleansing was not a removal of physical impurities, for it was to be accomplished with blood, and therefore must be a cleansing from sin. Thus says the apostle: \"It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the Heavens should be purified with these \n                                                                           263\n[the blood of animals]; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these [even the precious blood of Christ].\" [Hebrews 9:23.] To obtain a further knowledge of the cleansing to which the prophecy points, it was necessary to understand the ministration of the heavenly sanctuary. This could be learned only from the ministration of the earthly sanctuary; for Paul declares that the priests who officiated there served \"unto the example and shadow of heavenly things.\" [Hebrews 8:5.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 262}
