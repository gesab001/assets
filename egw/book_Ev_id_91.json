{"word": "To See the Needs as God Sees Them.--The Lord desires us to proclaim the third angel's message with power in these cities. . . . As we work with all the strength that God grants us, and in humility of heart, putting our entire trust in Him, our labors will not be without fruit. Our determined efforts to bring souls to a knowledge of the truth for this time will be seconded by holy angels, and many souls will be saved. The Lord never forsakes His faithful messengers. He sends to their aid heavenly agencies and accompanies their labors with the power of His Holy Spirit to convince and to convert. All heaven will endorse your appeals.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 38}
