    "word": "In the games referred to, but one was sure of the prize. In the Christian race, says the apostle: \"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly.\" We are not to be disappointed at the end of the race.

They all may gain the prize, and win and wear the crown of immortal glory that fadeth not away.",
