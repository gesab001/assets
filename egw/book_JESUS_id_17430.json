{"word": "\"Except your righteousness shall exceed the \n righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, \n ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom \n of heaven.\" Matthew 5:20. \n\n\n     The scribes and Pharisees had accused not only Christ but His disciples as sinners because of their disregard of the rabbinical rites and observances. Often the disciples had been perplexed and troubled by censure and accusation from those whom they had been accustomed to revere as religious teachers. Jesus unveiled the deception. He declared that the righteousness upon which the Pharisees set so great value was worthless. The Jewish nation had claimed to be the special, loyal people who were favored of God; but Christ represented their religion as devoid of saving faith. All their pretensions of piety, their human inventions and ceremonies, and even their boasted performance of the outward requirements of the law, could not avail to make them holy. They were not pure in heart or noble and Christlike in character.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MB", "page": 53}
