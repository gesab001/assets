{"word": "I asked the angel why there was no more faith and power in Israel. Said he, \\93Ye let go of the arm of the Lord too soon. Press your petitions to the throne, and hold on by strong faith. The promises are sure. Believe ye receive the things ye ask for, and ye shall have them.\\94 I was then pointed to Elijah. He was subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly. His faith endured the trial. Seven times he prayed before the Lord, and at last the cloud was seen. I saw that we had doubted the sure promises, and wounded the Saviour by our lack of faith. Said the angel, gird the armor about thee, and above all take the shield of faith, for that will guard the heart, the very life from the fiery \n61\ndarts of the wicked. If the Enemy can get the desponding to take their eyes off from Jesus, to look to themselves, to dwell upon their own unworthiness, instead of dwelling upon the worthiness of Jesus, his love, his merits, and his great mercy, he will get away their shield of faith and gain his object, and they will be exposed to his fiery temptations. Therefore, the weak should look to Jesus, and believe that they have faith, then they can exercise faith.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ExV", "page": 60}
