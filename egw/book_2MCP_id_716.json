{"word": "What the Words Reveal.--You cannot be too careful of what you say, for the words you utter show what power is controlling your mind and heart. If Christ rules in your heart, your words will reveal the purity, beauty, and fragrance of a character molded and fashioned by His will. But since his fall, Satan has been an accuser of \n\n580 \n\nthe brethren, and you must be on guard lest you reveal the same spirit.--Lt 69, 1896.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 579}
