There are cities in the South--New Orleans, Memphis, St. Louis--in which but little has been done, and there are others that have not been entered. In these places the standard of truth is to be uplifted. With might and power we are to carry the truth to the people.--Manuscript 56, 1904.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 398}
