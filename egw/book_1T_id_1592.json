    "word": "\"We appointed still another meeting for the next day, commencing at 10 a.m. I spoke upon the humiliation and glorification of Christ. Brother Ball sat near me and wept all the time I was talking. I spoke about an hour, then we commenced our labors for the youth.

He confessed to his children and to his wife that he had been in a backslidden state, and had been no help to them, but rather a hindrance. Tears flowed freely; his strong frame shook, and sobs choked his utterance.",
