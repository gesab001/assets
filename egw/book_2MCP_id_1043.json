{"word": "Our Duty to Believe.--Believe that the word of God will not fail, but that He is faithful that has promised. It is just as much your duty to believe that God will fulfill His word and forgive your sins as it is your duty to confess your sins. Your faith must be exercised in God as one that will do just as He has said He would do--pardon all your transgressions.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 677}
