{"word": "Triumphant Song at Jesus' Coming--Through a rift in the clouds [in the time of the end, when God's people are delivered], there beams a star whose brilliancy is increased fourfold in contrast with the darkness. It speaks hope and joy to the faithful, but severity and wrath to the transgressors of God's law. Those who have sacrificed all for Christ are now secure, hidden as in the secret of the Lord's pavilion. They have been tested, and before the world and the despisers of truth they have evinced their fidelity to Him who died for them.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 462}
