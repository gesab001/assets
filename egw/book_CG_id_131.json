{"word": "The Insects Teach Industry.--The industrious bee gives to men of intelligence an example that they would do well to imitate. These insects observe perfect order, and no idler is allowed in the hive. They execute their appointed work with an intelligence and activity that are beyond our comprehension. . . . The wise man calls our attention to the small things of the earth: \"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise; which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.\" \"The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer.\" We may learn from these little teachers a lesson of faithfulness. Should we improve with the same diligence the faculties which an \n                                                                           60\nall-wise Creator has bestowed upon us, how greatly would our capacities for usefulness be increased. God's eye is upon the smallest of His creatures; does He not, then, regard man formed in His image, and require of him corresponding returns for all the advantages He has given him?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 59}
