    "word": "The words of Christ find no response in your hearts, for you have blinded your eyes and hardened your hearts. In the books of heaven you are both accounted as of the world. Your hearts are sometimes troubled, but not enough to lead you to repent and change your course of action. The world holds your affections, and its customs are more agreeable to you than obedience to the heavenly Teacher.",
