    "word": "But you have heard me say all these things; you have read them, as I have written to you, and yet they have not affected your heart and life. You have set your heart against good and opened it to evil. You have placed yourself in the enemy's way and have had no hold upon God to enable you to resist his temptations. Suppose you do sever all connection with ----- through a revengeful spirit, because your brethren have told you the truth; whom will it injure, you or them?

He wants you to have truth in your heart and life, interwoven with your character.",
