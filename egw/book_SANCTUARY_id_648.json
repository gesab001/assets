{"word": "OUR PRAYERS ASCEND TO HEAVEN MOIST WITH CHRIST\\92S CLEANSING BLOOD.\\97The religious services, the prayers, the praise, the penitent confession of sin ascend from true believers as incense to the heavenly sanctuary, but passing through the corrupt channels of humanity, they are so defiled that unless purified by blood, they can never be of value with God. They ascend not in spotless purity, and unless the Intercessor, who is at God\\92s right hand, presents and purifies all by His righteousness, it is not acceptable to God. All incense from earthly tabernacles must be moist with the cleansing drops of the blood of Christ. He holds before the Father the censer of His own merits, in which there is no taint of earthly corruption. He gathers into this censer the prayers, the praise, and \n118\nthe confessions of His people, and with these He puts His own spotless righteousness. Then, perfumed with the merits of Christ\\92s propitiation, the incense comes up before God wholly and entirely acceptable. Then gracious answers are returned.\\97(Selected Messages, bk. 1, 344.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 117}
