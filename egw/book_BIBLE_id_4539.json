{"word": "Man's ingenuity, his judgment, his power to execute, all come from God. To God's service all should be devoted. The principles of the Bible are to control the Lord's servants. His workers are ever to do justice and judgment, steadfastly keeping the way of the Lord. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness\" (Matthew 6:33). Make this the point round which your life centers, and then all things needful will be given you. Put the Redeemer's interests before your own or those of any other human being. He has bought you, and all your powers belong to Him.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 74}
