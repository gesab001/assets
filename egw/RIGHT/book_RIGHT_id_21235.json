    "word": "I have much love for your souls, and much interest in your work, which is not your work, but God's. Let each one of us look to God and trust in God for himself. \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth\" [2 Timothy 2:15]. Do your duty day by day in love, in faith, in confidence, not by preaching only but by ministering, by diligent, earnest, godly labor.",
