    "word": "Our thoughts, motives, and desires are to be brought into obedience to the will of God. They are to be inspired and controlled by Him. We are to ask ourselves, \"Am I exerting all my capabilities to keep my lamp filled with oil, and carefully trimmed, that from it may shine, brightly and clearly, the light of present truth? Am I awakening the world to its danger? Am I leading perishing souls to Christ? Am I arousing men to see that the end of all things is at hand?\" . . .",
