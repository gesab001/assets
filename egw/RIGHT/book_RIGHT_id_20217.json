    "word": "It is a critical time now with many. There are a number in the valley of decision, right upon the point of taking their stand. One is an overseer in the shoe manufacturing establishment. He has a family. He is a man of ability, but as soon as he takes his position then he can no more keep his place, and his wife is a bitter opposer. Oh, may the Lord help these poor souls. I think we must pray more for these persons, convinced but who see the cross and dare not lift it, for to do so would take away the support, and they have families. They know the truth and feel deeply, but dare not venture.",
