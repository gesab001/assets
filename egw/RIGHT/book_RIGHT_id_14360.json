    "word": "We are to act as Christ's property, His sons and daughters. To all who receive Him He gives power to become His sons and \n88\ndaughters, even to those who believe on His name. They are then newborn souls, translated into the kingdom of God. \u201cAnd the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\u201d The power of God is to work in the character of every one who is born again. We are God's property, and He wants every one to be a co-labourer with Him. No one has anything beyond that which God gives him. All that he has, his time, his ability, his strength, given him in trust by God, has been bought with a price. A ransom has been paid which includes every son and daughter of Adam. The precious blood of Christ has been given to redeem man from earthliness, from sensuality, from all spiritual and physical uncleanness. This is the covenant God has made with His people. They are to be His chosen ones. Those who truly receive Christ will not yield to any other claim, even for a moment, which would strengthen the powers hostile to righteousness and truth. They put on the yoke of Christ, devoting themselves unreservedly to Christ for all time. They are pledged to obey the commandment of God, even should every other member of the human family refuse obedience and become disloyal.",
