    "word": "All who enter the missionary field will have hardships and trials to endure; they will find hard work, and plenty of it; but those of the right stamp of character will persevere under difficulties, discouragements, and privations, holding firmly to the arm of the Lord. They will show a zeal that will not flag, a faith that will not yield, a resolution that will not weaken. They are doing no more than God requires, when they dedicate themselves, soul, body, and spirit, to His service, becoming partakers with Christ in His sufferings. If they share His self-denial and cross-bearing, they will be partakers also in His joy,--the joy of seeing souls saved through their instrumentality in the kingdom of glory.
