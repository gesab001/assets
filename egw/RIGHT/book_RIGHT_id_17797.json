    "word": "Bro. Day, encourage simplicity, love, forbearance, and sweet union with your brethren. But do not, oh do not, sell everlasting life so cheaply. You will never know real happiness if you go from the truth. You will be miserable indeed. Heaven is worth making any and every sacrifice for. Break the bands of Satan. Jesus is now inviting you. Will you listen to his voice? You must take a higher stand than you have hitherto done. Make the kingdom of Heaven, and the righteousness of Christ, your first business. Live for God and Heaven, and the eternal reward will be yours at the end of the race.",
