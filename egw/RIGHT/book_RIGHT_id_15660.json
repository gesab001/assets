    "word": "Religion, my son, is not as some take it, head work, theory. It must be practically carried out in all the byways and broadways of life. It must regulate the life as well as to convince the mind. It alone must purify the heart. God requires everyone who professes His name to be good citizens and that the life of strict integrity and pure devotion should leave a bright light to the world.--Letter 35, July 30, 1876, to \"Dear Children.\" Edson had just turned 27; Willie was 21.",
