    "word": "\"The curse causeless shall not come\" (Proverbs 26:2). \"Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him. . . . Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him\" (Isaiah 3:10, 11). \"Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts\" (Jeremiah 6:19). Terrible is this truth, and deeply should it be impressed. Every deed reacts upon the doer. Never a human being but may recognize, in the evils that curse his life, fruitage of his own sowing. Yet even thus we are not without hope. . . .",
