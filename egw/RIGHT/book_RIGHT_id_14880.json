    "word": "The destruction of souls is the regular employment of Satan and his agents upon the earth. The salvation of souls is the work of every follower of Christ, however weak. When [a man's] selfish interest is made first and the salvation of souls comes secondary, if at all, that man is working on Satan's side, for his very pretensions are a snare to lead others off the track, that they shall not consider the kingdom of God and His righteousness first. Satan is getting the start of all such workers. The salvation of souls comes first, always, for Satan as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour. We must snatch souls away from his path. We must have clear foresight, discernment, and faith, and work as if to save a perishing life, of which some carelessness on our part might be the cause of death.",
