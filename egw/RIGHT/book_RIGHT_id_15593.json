    "word": "God loves His people, and He wants them to make their peace with Him. He wants everyone to stand in that relation to others that he is willing to make any sacrifice in order to save the souls of his brethren. They may not have done right. But God wants us to work earnestly to help them, that His name may not be dishonored before the world. God does not give us promises because we have always done right, but that His name may be glorified.",
