    "word": "Through this acceptance of hearsay evidence the enemy obtains great advantage in councils and committee meetings. Those who would stand for the right, if they knew what it was, have to wade about in the foul pools of evil surmisings, because they are misled by the surmisings of someone in whom they have confidence. Their prayers are hindered, their faith is paralyzed, and unkind thoughts, unholy suspicions, come in to do their work of alienation among brethren. God is dishonored, souls are imperiled.",
