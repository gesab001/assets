    "word": "And Habakkuk, rapt in holy vision, beheld His appearing. \u201cGod came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light.\u201d \u201cHe stood, and measured the earth; he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow; his ways are everlasting.\u201d \u201cThou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation.\u201d \u201cThe mountains saw thee, and they trembled. . .  The deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high. The sun and moon stood still in their habitation; at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.\u201d \u201cThou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed.\u201d [Habakkuk 3:3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13.]",
