    "word": "How to Shine \n\n     Christ does not say to us, \"Strive to shine.\" He says, \"Let your light shine.\" He in whose heart Christ abides cannot help shining. \"Let your light shine.\" Do not allow your light to be dimmed by selfishness or unrighteous actions. Never gather clouds about you; for this means concealment of your light. Do not dim it by speaking words of harshness or anger. Let the light shine forth brightly to those within and without the home. Gather rays of light from Him who is the Light of the world, and shine more and more brightly. Let your lamp be always trimmed and burning.",
