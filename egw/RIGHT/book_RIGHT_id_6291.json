    "word": "We may flatter ourselves . . . that our moral character has been correct and we need not humble ourselves before God like the common sinner. But we must be content to enter into life in the very same way as the chief of sinners. We must renounce our own righteousness and plead for the righteousness of Christ to be imputed to us. We must depend wholly upon Christ for our strength. Self must die. We must acknowledge that all we have is from the exceeding riches of divine grace. Let this be the language of our hearts: \"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.\"",
