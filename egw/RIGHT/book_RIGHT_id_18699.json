    "word": "God has bestowed power on the church and the ministers of the church, and it is not a light matter to resist the authority and despise the judgment of God's ministers. . . . You should have submitted to the judgment of the church. If they decided wrong, God could take hold of this matter in His own time and vindicate the right. He does not lay upon you the responsibility of keeping the church in order.--Letter 5, 1863, pp. 1-3. (To Brother and Sister Scott, July 6, 1863.)",
