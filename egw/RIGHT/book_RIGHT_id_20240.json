    "word": "Elder Ballenger, Sister Gotzian, W. C. White, and I had quite a lengthy talk concerning Paradise Valley Sanitarium. Will it be wisdom to turn it \n\n\n                                   -135- \n\nover to the conference now [that] the buildings are well prepared for convenience to give thorough treatment? We are the persons who have invested in the sanitarium, and at first they were unwilling to take it, but we think now that they will be willing. We then united in prayer, and then it was my bedtime. Took my bath and went to bed, and after a period of wakefulness, slept. The stars are shining brightly, and there is no fog or appearance of rain.",
