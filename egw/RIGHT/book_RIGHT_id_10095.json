    "word": "Chapter 18 \n\n     1-10. God's Way.--[Jeremiah 18:1-10 quoted.] This presents before us God's way of dealing with His people. He sends warnings. He pleads with them to cease to do evil and learn to do well. Hear the words of Christ, for they are spoken to all who claim to be His people. Blessings are promised to all who follow the Lord to do righteousness, but those who walk in their own ways show that under the trying circumstances liable to occur anywhere, they will prove unfaithful, and God cannot bless them (Letter 34, 1899).",
