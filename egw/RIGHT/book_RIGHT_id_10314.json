The Sorrow of True Repentance.--\"Be afflicted, and mourn and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy into heaviness.\" It is right to be cheerful, and even joyful. It is right to cultivate cheerfulness of spirit through sanctification of the truth; but it is not right to indulge in foolish jesting and joking, in lightness and trifling, in words of criticism and condemnation of others.",
