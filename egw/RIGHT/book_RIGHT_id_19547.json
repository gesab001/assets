    "word": "Cover yourself with the righteousness of Christ. Let not unadvised words and actions injure your influence. Do not think that your course of action is perfect, and that no one should question it. Our people will certainly question your course unless they see that you are moving under the influence of the Holy Spirit in all meekness and lowliness of heart. The sharp way in which you sometimes bear down on others will tell upon you. You need to be melted over by the Spirit of God. You need to cherish the gentleness of Christ.--Letter 215, 1902, pp. 1-4. (To A. T. Jones, May 7, 1902.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. October 6, 1981",
