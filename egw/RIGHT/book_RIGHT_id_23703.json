Those who do this when it suits them, are bringing souls into unbelief and temptation, and driving them on Satan's battlefield. They forget that God will deal with them as they deal with their fellow men. God's cause is not to be molded by one man, \n                                                                           411\nor half a dozen men. All his responsible stewards are to bear a share in the devising, as well as in the execution of the plans. Men must not forget that the God of heaven is a God of justice; with him is no partiality, no hypocrisy.
