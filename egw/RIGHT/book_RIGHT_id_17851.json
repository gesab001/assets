    "word": "The Jones family love display. The mother is not a prudent, dignified woman. She is not qualified to bring up children. \n                                                                           37\nThe dress of her children, to make a show, is of greater consequence to her than the inward adorning. She has not disciplined herself. Her will has not been brought into conformity to the will of God. Her heart is not right with God. She is a stranger to the operation of his Spirit upon the heart, bringing the desires and affections in conformity to the obedience of Christ. She does not possess ennobling qualities of mind, and does not discern sacred things. She has let her children do as they pleased. The fearful experience she has had with two of her elder children has not made the deep impression on her mind that the circumstances demanded. She has educated her children to love dress, vanity, and folly. She has not disciplined her two younger girls. Charles, under a proper influence, would be a worthy young man; but he has much to learn. He follows inclination rather than duty. He loves to follow his own will and pleasure, and has not a correct knowledge of the duties devolving upon a Christian. Self-gratification, and his own inclination, he would gladly interpret to be duty. Self-gratification he has not overcome. He has a work to do to clear his spiritual vision, that he may understand what it is to be sanctified to God, and learn the high claims of God upon him. The serious defects in his education have affected his life. \n                                                                           38",
