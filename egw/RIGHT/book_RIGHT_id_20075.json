    "word": "My prayer to our heavenly Father is, Lord, let the clear light shine forth. Carefully and prayerfully studied, God's Word keeps men well-balanced. In this \n\n\n                                   -75- \n\nWord we find God's way clearly defined. No one who searches the Word with sincerity will walk in darkness. But we cannot cast aside the light God sends, and at the same time walk in its rays. To be Christians at all, we must be Christians in all things, revealing His virtues, doing His works. The truth is our safeguard. Planted in the heart by the Holy Spirit, it enables us to see clearly the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Those who cherish the truth will refuse to be drawn into speculation.--Manuscript 26a, 1890. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 1, 1985 Entire Manuscript",
