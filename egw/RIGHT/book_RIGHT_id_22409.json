We had a beautiful night. We were not crowded in the sleeper. Sarah was invited to remain in the sleeper and the porter said he would make her up a berth after the conductor of the sleeping car went through, but she told him she could not accept it for it would not be right to have a berth made up for her unless she paid for it, and she could not well do this at that time. The porter then talked with the conductor and he told Sarah that there would be spare berths. She could have two seats and remain in the car and make herself as comfortable as possible. We felt thankful for this favor. We praised the Lord for putting it in the hearts of these men to be kind and attentive to us. We had good cool air and the car was not overheated.",
