    "word": "Among our people there has been a trifling with personal responsibilities. I tell you with sorrow that some of our Conferences are weak in Christian experience because their leading men \u2014 and the people have followed the example \u2014 have sought for the approval of man with far greater anxiety than for the approval of God; they have looked to man for help and counsel more than they have looked to God. They have made men their burden-bearers, and have accepted human wisdom just when and where they should depend upon God. And too often those of whom they seek counsel, need help themselves; for their souls are not right with God.",
