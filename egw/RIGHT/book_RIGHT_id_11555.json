    "word": "Some have felt under sacred obligations to their children. They must give them each a portion, but feel themselves unable to raise means to aid the cause of God. They make the excuse that they have a duty to do their children. This may be right, but their first duty belongs to God. Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. Rob not God by withholding from him your tithes and offerings. It is the first, sacred duty, to render to God a suitable proportion. Let no one throw in their claims and lead you to rob God. Let not your children steal your offering from God's altar for their own benefit.",
