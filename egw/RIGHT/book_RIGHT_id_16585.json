    "word": "In His lessons Christ shows us how we may reveal the pure, unselfish love, and the unquestioning faith, that He manifested in coming from heaven to become one with humanity, that human beings, by living pure, holy lives, might become one with Him, and thus one with God. Keenly does He rebuke all distrust and every phase of unbelief. He invites us to learn to cast all our care upon Him; for without help from Him we can not carry aright the heavy burdens of life.",
