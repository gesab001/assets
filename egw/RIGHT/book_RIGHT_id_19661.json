    "word": "I was saying to you with intensity of feeling, \"Emma, God will be found of you when you seek Him with all your heart. He will be found of you, then you can with words, in patience, forbearance, longsuffering, and gentleness diffuse the love of Jesus. Catching His Spirit, you can shine as a steady, bright light to all that are around you, but you are in danger because you are losing the precious grace of the Spirit of the Master. You are becoming too much absorbed in temporal matters, and allowing these business matters to have the supremacy and quench the love of God which should be exercised toward those who need it.",
