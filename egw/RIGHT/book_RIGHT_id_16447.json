An effort is being made by those at the head of the medical work in Battle Creek to get control of property over which, in the sight of the heavenly courts, \n                                                                           9\nthey have no rightful control. I write now to guard ministers and lay members from being misled by those who are making these efforts. There is a deceptive working going on to obtain property in an underhand way. This is condemned by the law of God. I will mention no names. But there are doctors and ministers who have been influenced by the hypnotism exercised by the father of lies. Notwithstanding the warnings given, Satan's sophistries are being accepted now just as they were accepted in the heavenly courts. The science by which our first parents were deceived is deceiving men today. Ministers and physicians are being drawn into the snare.",
