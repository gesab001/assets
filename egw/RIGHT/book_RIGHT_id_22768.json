Kellogg, \n     Sanitarium, Battle Creek, Mich., U.S.A. Dear Brother:-- \n     I want to say that the Third Angel's Message is the gospel, and that health reform is the wedge by which the truth may enter. There are to be no abrupt declarations of any phase of our truth, but the truth as it is in Jesus is to be preached, and all the brightness and special radiance of the Sun of righteousness brought into the gospel. If those who shall speak of practical godliness to those assembled in your church building would do this, they will dwell upon the lessons of Christ. You want the Holy Spirit's guidance; do not be satisfied without it. Let your words express your confidence and love for God, The most simple testimonies, borne in a humble manner, and expressing love for God, will touch hearts. They will see that the doctors and nurses and workers are all combined to represent the truth in character.",
