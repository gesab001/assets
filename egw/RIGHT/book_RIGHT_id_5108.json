    "word": "NO NIGHT OR NEED OF REST.\u2014In the City of God \u201cthere shall be no night.\u201d None will need or desire repose. There will be no weariness in doing the will of God and offering praise to His name. We shall ever feel the freshness of the morning and shall ever be far from its close. \u201cAnd they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.\u201d Revelation 22:5. The light of the sun will be superseded by a radiance which is not painfully dazzling, yet which immeasurably surpasses the \n141\nbrightness of our noontide. The glory of God and the Lamb floods the Holy City with unfading light. The redeemed walk in the sunless glory of perpetual day.\u2014GC 676.",
