    "word": "My husband spoke very decidedly and sharply. Said he, \"You who left your own machine to correct the large wheel were out of your place. Had you kept by your own machines and worked them correctly, the large machine would have been all right.\" I thought my husband spoke very earnestly and reproved those who left their own work to attend to that which was not their work. Those that had been the most to blame said, \"Do not be so severe. We \n\n\n                                       -3- \n\nthought we were carrying out your express directions in doing as we have done. But all we needed was a word and we would see our error. We thought everything was going to pieces, therefore left the very work we should have done, to save such a calamity, and sought to correct the large machinery, and so we made things very much worse.--Ms. 1, 1873. (MR 900.14).",
