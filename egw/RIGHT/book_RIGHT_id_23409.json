    "word": "Sympathy with Teachers \n\n     We feel sorry indeed that any weakness of character should mar the record of the past, because we know that if you had watched unto prayer, this need not have been. We feel sorry for your teachers; for your wrong conduct places upon them burdens they ought not to be asked to bear. They may have moved unwisely; for each one has the weakness of his own natural character to contend against. They may have thought they were doing right when they were making mistakes. But how much better it would be if every student would place himself upon his honor, and cherish pure, high, noble motives, feeling it his duty to help his teachers in every possible way, thinking how he would like to be treated were he in a position of trust and responsibility.",
