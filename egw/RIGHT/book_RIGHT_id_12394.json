    "word": "Brother C has a set will; his likes and dislikes are very strong. If he starts on a wrong track, and follows the bent of his mind, not moving in wisdom, and his error is presented before him, even if he knows he is not right, he is so reluctant to acknowledge that he has been in error and has pursued a wrong course that he will frame some kind of excuse to make others believe that he is, after all, about right. This is the reason why he has been left to follow his own judgment and wisdom, which are foolishness.",
