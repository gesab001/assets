    "word": "God's people in these last days are not to choose darkness rather than light. They are to look for light, to expect light. The light will continue to shine from the Word of God whether men will hear or forbear, whether they will come to the light or turn from the light. Many who follow on to know the Lord will know that His going forth is prepared as the morning. The light will continue to shine in brighter and still brighter rays, and reveal more and more distinctly the truth as it is in Jesus, that human hearts and human characters may be improved and moral darkness which Satan is working to bring over the people of God may be dispelled.",
