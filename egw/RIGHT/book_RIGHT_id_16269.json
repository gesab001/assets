    "word": "Power of Christ. \n\n     The power of Christ, the crucified Saviour, to give eternal life, should be presented to the people. We should show them that the Old Testament is as verily the gospel in types and shadows as the New Testament is in its unfolding power. The New Testament is not a new religion, and the Old Testament is not a religion \n\n\n                         - 41 - \n\nto be superseded by the New. The New Testament is only the advancement and unfolding of the Old. Abel was a believer in Christ, and was as verily saved by his power as was Peter or Paul. Enoch was a representative of Christ as surely as was the beloved disciple, John. Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him. To him was committed the message of the second coming of Christ. \"And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\" The message preached by Enoch, and his translation to heaven, were a convincing argument to all living in Enoch's time. These things were an argument that Methuselah and Noah could use with power to show that the righteous could be translated.",
