    "word": "No taint of self-seeking is to mar our service. \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\" Matthew 6:24. Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary. Lift Him up by living faith in God, that your prayers may prevail. Do we realize how near Jesus will come to us? He is speaking to us individually. He will reveal Himself to everyone who is willing to be clothed with the robe of His righteousness. He declares, \"I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand.\" \n                                                                           254\nIsaiah 41:13. Let us place ourselves where He can hold us by the hand, where we can hear Him saying with assurance and authority, \"I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore.\" Revelation 1:18.",
