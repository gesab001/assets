    "word": "Wright, Sunday, May 1, 1859--A good congregation. The Lord met with us in the afternoon and eve. The fore part of the day we were not idle. We called on Brother Tubbs. Spent a few hours in profitable conversation; then left to call on Brother and Sister Ferguson. They live in a splendid house. Have no children. . . . Had a profitable season of conversation and prayer before parting with them. We next went to Brother McPherson's. We were heartily received and we enjoyed the interview with them much. They are open-hearted, sound people. This brother is also wealthy, but has it all in lands for he cannot use much. \n\n\n                                    -218-",
