    "word": "One Man Supplies Deficiency of Another.--Jesus chose men for His disciples who were diverse in character, that the work should be done with perfection. There is a disposition in men to think they are the only ones who can do the work right and make it a success, when they are most sadly deficient in essential qualities which must be supplied to make the work a success. Thus it is with our beloved Elder C. We must all give room for others to come by our side and work harmoniously with us that one may supply the deficiency of another and all blend together in perfect harmony. The Review and Herald can be improved, and it ought to be made a much better paper than it is.",
