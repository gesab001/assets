    "word": "Why there has been so little accomplished by those who preach the truth, is not wholly because the truth they bear is unpopular, but because the men who bear the message are not sanctified by the truths they preach. The Saviour withdraws his smiles, and the inspiration of his Spirit is not upon them. The presence and power of God to convict the sinner and cleanse from all unrighteousness is not manifest. Sudden destruction is right upon the people, and yet they are not fearfully alarmed. The unconsecrated minister makes the work very hard for those who follow after them, and who have the burden and spirit of the work upon them.",
