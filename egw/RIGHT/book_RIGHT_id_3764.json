    "word": "In the great harvest field there is abundance of work for all, and those who neglect to do what they can, will be found guilty before God. Let us work for time and for eternity. Let us work for the youth with all the powers God has bestowed upon us, and He will bless our well-directed efforts. Our Saviour longs to save the young. He would rejoice to see them around His throne clothed in the spotless robes of His righteousness. He is waiting to place upon their heads the crown of life, and hear their happy voices join in ascribing honor and glory and majesty to God and the Lamb in the song of victory that shall echo and re-echo throughout the courts of heaven.--Review and Herald, August 19, 26, 1884.",
