    "word": "\"This spirit does not bear the marks of the divine, but of the power and subtlety of the enemy of God and of man.  I say it is from beneath and not in harmony with the Spirit of God, or with the message He has given His servants to bear at the present time. When the Lord sends us light and food that all the churches need, we may well expect that the enemy of all righteousness will do his utmost to prevent that light [from] coming in its native heavenly bearings to the people. He lays hold of minds full of unbelief and doubts to wheel into his service, to serve his purpose, to intercept the light that God means shall come to His chosen ones.\"",
