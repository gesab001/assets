Efficacy of Christ's Blood.--Thank God that \n                                                                           948\nHe who spilled His blood for us, lives to plead it, lives to make intercession for every soul who receives Him. \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin. It speaketh better things than the blood of Abel, for Christ ever liveth to make intercession for us. We need to keep ever before us the efficacy of the blood of Jesus. That life-cleansing, life-sustaining blood, appropriated by living faith, is our hope. We need to grow in appreciation of its inestimable value, for it speaks for us only as we by faith claim its virtue, keeping the conscience clean and at peace with God.  {7BC 947.11}  \n     This is represented as the pardoning blood, inseparably connected with the resurrection and life of our Redeemer, illustrated by the ever-flowing stream that proceeds from the throne of God, the water of the river of life (Letter 87, 1894).",
