    "word": "Tacoma Park, D. C., May 14, 1905. \n\n     Dear Brother Burden: Your letter has just been read. I had no sooner finished reading it than I said, \"I will consult no one: for I have no question at all about the matter. . . . Secure the property by all means, so that it can be held, and then obtain all the money you can and make sufficient payments to hold the place. Do not delay; for it is just what is needed. I think that sufficient help can be secured to carry the matter through. I want you to be sure to lose no time in securing the right to purchase the property. We will do out utmost to help you raise the money. I know that Redlands and Riverside are to be worked, and I pray that the Lord may be gracious, and not allow any one else to get this property instead of us.",
