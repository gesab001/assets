    "word": "I have been giving reading matter to the postmaster in Cooranbong. In the absence of the minister he takes his place. During the institute we held last April, he was convicted of the truth; but a minister who seems to be a second Canright came in with all his false statements and theories, and created such a state of things that those who had been interested, turned their ears from truth to fables. I have also given the stationmaster Great Controversy, and some books for his children, and have supplied other families with books and papers. This reading matter may do them good sometime. The light must be introduced into families by reading matter, if we cannot get them to come and hear. I am glad to say that as a result of our labors in Cooranbong and vicinity, several families are now keeping the Sabbath. We hope to do more visiting when we return home. Letter 55, 1896, pp. 1-6. (To Brother and Sister Kellogg, November 14, 1896.)",
