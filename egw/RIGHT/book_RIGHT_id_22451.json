    "word": "The lessons of Christ could give them precious gems and jewels of truth which had been lost sight of. He gathered up these grand, glorious jewels--originated by Himself and given to patriarchs, prophets, and apostles-- and replaced them in the framework of the gospel, giving them their own divine brightness. But the Jews were obstinate. Their own ideas and customs and practices were their idols. Would they give up their own misinterpretations, which they had taught the people to regard as sacred doctrines? No; never! They formed a confederacy to stand by the old traditions. Their human interpretations they set in defiance to the lessons and pure truths of practical godliness.",
