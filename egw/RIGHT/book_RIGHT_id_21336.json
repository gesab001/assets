    "word": "Measuring Out Hard Judgment \n     There is too much selfish love among us. If there is a brother who encourages all we do and suggest, as right, then we esteem that brother above others. If there is another whom we imagine does not look with favor on our way of doing things, we withdraw from that one and seek to demerit his work. The Holy Spirit is grieved with such a selfish religion as this, and unless it is realized and put away, a spirit of prejudice and alienation will mar the work of God. God is dishonored when His people do not \"love as brethren,\" when the pattern is not correctly represented.",
