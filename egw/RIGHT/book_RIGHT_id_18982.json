    "word": "When you meet with unreasonable demands, and unreasonable requirements, bear in mind that those who command you are not working as agents of God, but agents of Satan, through whom he is working. Let your effort be to say or do anything that will help the tempted soul to resist the devil. This is the truest missionary work. Let every one heed the command of the chief Commander, \"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breast plate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God: praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and \n\n\n                                    -206- \n\nwatching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.\" Read the sixth chapter of Ephesians with prayerful interest, and may the Lord apply it to your souls with power.",
