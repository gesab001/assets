    "word": "The youth of today have increased light. The Bible teaches the whole duty of men, women, and children. \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" Divine wisdom came to Daniel and his companions as they studied the Word. They knew that this Word was their authority, and that it demanded their obedience. The truth was to them of the highest importance; for it placed their duty before them in a clear light.",
