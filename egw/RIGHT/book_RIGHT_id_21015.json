    "word": "There was nothing in the scenery to especially engage our attention until Wednesday night but the prairie fires. These looked grand and awful. In the distance, while the train moved slowly onward, we saw the long belts of lurid flame stretching miles across the prairies as a wall of fire. As the wind rises, the flames leap higher and become more grand, brightening the desolate plains with their awful light. We see, farther on, hay stacks and settlers' homes guarded with deep furrows broken by the plow to protect them from the fire. We saw dark objects in the distance guarding their homes from the fire fiend.",
