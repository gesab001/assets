    "word": "We must see in Christ a perfect representation of the law of Jehovah. He came to this earth to remove every vestige of excuse from every mortal living on the earth to deride the character of God. What is His law? An expression of His character; a transcript of His character. Jesus came that everyone that would believe in Him, everyone that would repent of their transgressions and accept of the righteousness of Christ, could come back to their loyalty; everyone upon whom the light shone.",
