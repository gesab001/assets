    "word": "The cook has no time to read her Bible. You say, I hire the cook. And has not the cook any soul as well as you? The cook has a soul to save, and you want to educate and train that cook to seek God in the morning, to seek Him at night, and to live so she can have a chance to read her Bible. With all the wonderful preparations for man's appetite and taste and passions for the varieties of his life, people rob God of His service. They have no time to go to their neighbors and to teach them right in the shadow of their own doors how they may love Jesus and how Jesus loves them.",
