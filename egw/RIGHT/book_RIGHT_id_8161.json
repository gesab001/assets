    "word": "Train to Serve\n \n\n     Youth, rightly instructed, will be earnest workers for the Master.--Young men and women should be educated for service in the cause of God. The Lord chooses the young because they are strong in body and vigorous in mind; and if the youth are rightly instructed, they will be earnest workers for the Master. God will be the counselor of the young if they put their trust in Him; He will accept them, and exalt them to be co-laborers with Himself, if they will yield themselves in submission to His will.--RH March 24, 1891.",
