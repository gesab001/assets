    "word": "Are there any . . . that are thirsting for the living water, and feel--O, that I might find it? I look to the right and it is not there, I seek it to the left and I find it not. I look before me, and behind me, and yet I cannot find my Saviour. Do you want to know how to find Him? Come to Him just as needy and dependent as you are, in the simplicity of a little child, in all the confidence that a child has in its parents, and ask your Saviour to pity you in your great necessity. Tell Him that you want the water of salvation. . . .",
