    "word": "I want to tell you, my brother, that human wisdom unless sanctified day by day is foolishness. That which finite beings take great pride in is very weak in the sight of a holy God. Very much is expressed in these words: \"This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" \"Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise loving kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.\"",
