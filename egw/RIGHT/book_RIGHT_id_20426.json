    "word": "The removal of one safeguard from the conscience, the failure to do the very thing that the Lord has marked out, one step in the path of wrong principle, often leads to an entire change of the life and action. It is a terrible thing for men standing in responsible positions not to understand when to say Yea, and when Nay. Satan has used men to deceive, to allure, to betray souls that they may obtain some selfish purpose. God says, \"My people have been deceived by men who forget God, who walk contrary to His word, who have felt they have no need of light from above, and who have walked in slippery paths.\" It is no longer safe for human souls to follow human devisings. We are safe only in following where Christ leads the way. The path will grow clearer, brighter and brighter, unto the perfect day.",
