    "word": "The Lord accepts no such transactions; prosperity will not attend these moves. Men connected with his work have been dealing unjustly, and it is time to call a halt. Let men deal with men upon the principles of the ten commandments, and not ignore these principles in business transactions. False propositions are assumed as truth and righteousness, and then everything is worked in such a way as to carry out these propositions, which are not in accordance with the will of God, but are a misrepresentation of his character.",
