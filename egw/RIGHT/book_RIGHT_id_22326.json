    "word": "You strengthened the hands of evil doers. Consider how many joined Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Two hundred and fifty princes, men of renown in the tribes of Israel. They made as firm a stand as you have made. They worked as you have worked. The people believed in Korah, Dathan and Abiram because they set things before them in a perverted light. They honestly thought these men were right. They had heard so many false representations and that Moses and Aaron were all wrong, but the result testified who were right and who were wrong. Korah, Dathan and Abiram had done a similar work as you have been doing.",
