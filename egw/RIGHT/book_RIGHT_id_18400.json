    "word": "In Brother and Sister Haskell, the Lord has sent us the right help. . . . He presents truth in a clear, earnest manner that carries its own evidence with it to the hearts of those that hear it. As matron and teacher, Sister Haskell could not be excelled. She is firm as a rock to principle, and she has no special favorites. She loves all, and helps all.--Letter 99, 1897, pp. 3, 4 (To Elder and Mrs. Olsen, Aug. 19, 1897.)",
