    "word": "The priests and judges, exulting in the advantage they had gained through the words of Jesus, but anxious to hide their malicious satisfaction, now pressed close to him, and, as if they could not believe that they had heard aright, simultaneously inquired, \"Art thou the Christ? tell us.\" Jesus looked calmly at his hypocritical questioners, and answered, \"If I tell you, ye will not believe. And if I ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.\" Jesus could have traced down the prophecies, and given his accusers evidence that the very things were then taking place which had been predicted in regard to Messiah. He could have silenced them thus; but they would not then have believed. He could have pointed them to his mighty miracles; but they had set their hearts against the light of Heaven, and no power could change them.",
