    "word": "The rooms were warmed by tall, earthenware stoves, reaching nearly to the ceiling. These stoves are made square or round to suit the taste, of various colors, and many are more ornamental than our black iron stoves. The one in the family sitting-room was nearly square, and set in one side was a large gilt-framed mirror, not less than six feet long and half as wide. In the morning a wood fire is made, and when the fire is well under way, the doors may be opened, and we have a bright, cheerful blaze throwing out its heat into the room as from a fire-place. When the wood has burned down to a coal, the doors are shut, and the drafts closed. Thus the whole structure becomes heated, and retains its warmth all day. In most Swedish houses, one of these stoves is to be found in nearly every room except the kitchen.",
