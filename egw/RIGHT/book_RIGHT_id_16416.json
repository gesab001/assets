    "word": "Satan will furnish an abundance of speculative projects, that are not after God's order, but are inspired by man's ambitious devising. Thousands of dollars may be spent in traveling. In this way money is consumed, but it accomplishes little. The only right way is to stop devising wonderful plans that absorb means and create inventions that God does not inspire, and devote the Lord's means, and your God-given faculties, to setting in operation a work that will reach the neglected ones, the oppressed, those that cannot rise of themselves.",
