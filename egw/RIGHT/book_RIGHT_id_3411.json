    "word": "Don't you know that when the young man came to Christ and asked Him what he should do that he might have life, Christ told him to keep the commandments. Said he, \"I have done it.\" Now the Lord wanted to bring this lesson right home. \"What lack I yet? I am perfectly whole\" (Matthew 19:20). He did not see that there was a thing the matter with him or why he should not have eternal life. \"I have done it,\" he said. Now Christ touches the plague spot of his heart. He says, \"Come, follow Me, and ye shall have life.\"",
