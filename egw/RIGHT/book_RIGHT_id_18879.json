    "word": "Sister White: Brother Leininger's children had no need to have died, but they were not under the discipline of the care that they ought to have had. The Lord wants us to have that education that we can utilize, and the most simple education that the children can have now is the very best for them. Then there will be a reaching out after more and more education, as years come on. But they are not to stuff themselves right now with things clear beyond their years. It is not the right thing to do. We have got to have our A.B.C., and the Alpha is not the Omega. We must learn that.",
