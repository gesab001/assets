    "word": "June 28, 1892. \"Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name.\" I am compassed with infirmities, yet I am of good courage in the Lord. Although the enemy is permitted to afflict me, yet I have great blessings from day to day. My head is free from pain, shielded by the hand of the Lord. My shoulders and arms are full of pain, but my right forearm, from the elbow to the tips of my fingers, is free from pain. I am able to do much important writing.",
