    "word": "A few weeks ago I lost my housekeeper, Mrs. Nelson, who had been with me for nearly four years. She was faithful and true in her work, and a real caretaker. I shall never find a housekeeper who will suit me better. But she desired to finish the nurses' course, which she began in Battle Creek four years ago. Then, too, her husband, from whom she has been separated for six years, wishes to come back to her. Had I urged it, Mrs. Nelson might have stayed with me, but I could not have done this. It would not have been right. It would have been selfish for me to say, I cannot part with you.",
