WHITE FOR REVIVAL AND REFORMATION WAS PUBLISHED IN THE REVIEW AND HERALD OF MARCH 22, 1887, UNDER THE TITLE \"THE CHURCH'S NEED.\" THIS ARTICLE WAS DRAWN FROM HEAVILY IN THE COMPILATION OF MATERIALS PREPARED BY ELDER A. G. DANIELLS, FOR CHRIST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. IN THE INITIAL PRINTINGS (1926 AND 1937) THE ARTICLE ALSO APPEARED IN ITS ENTIRETY IN THE APPENDIX. FOR MECHANICAL REASONS IN LATER PRINTINGS (1941 AND ONWARD), THE ARTICLE, SELECTIONS FROM WHICH HAD APPEARED IN THE TEXT OF THE BOOK ITSELF, WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE APPENDIX. THIS MUCH-SOUGHT-AFTER ARTICLE IN ITS ENTIRETY NOW OPENS THIS STIRRING SECTION.",
