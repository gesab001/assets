    "word": "The work to be carried on here at Loma Linda is a great work. To carry it forward successfully every one of us must stand in right relation to God, all striving to be learners in the school of Christ. We are not to stand in the position of persons looking for some opportunity to differ from one another. We are not to cherish differences of opinion and keep them to the front; but we are to seek to be of one mind, one heart, one spirit; because there is One who stands at our head, and it is His character that we are to represent, in our labors and associations together.",
