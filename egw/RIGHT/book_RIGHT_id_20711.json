    "word": "A great work will be accomplished by the people of God if they will work in unity and unselfishness and with humility of heart. All self-exaltation must be seen and put away. Truth and righteousness alone will stand the test for this time. We need to have the Spirit of God daily with us, that we may be kept from all evil thoughts and unwise actions, from lifting the soul unto vanity. We should fear lest our eyes become blinded to our individual spiritual needs in these perilous times. Many professed believers have been allowing themselves to become absorbed in the upbuilding of selfish interests. We are now to awake out of sleep [Romans 13:11].",
