    "word": "When Stephen was called upon to suffer for Christ's sake, he did not waver. He read his fate in the cruel faces of his persecutors, and he did not hesitate to give to them the last message which he was to bear to men. He looked up and said, \"I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.\" All heaven was interested in this case. Jesus, rising from the throne of His Father, was leaning over, looking upon the face of His servant, and imparting to his countenance the beams of His own glory, and men were astonished as they saw Stephen's face lighted up as if it had been the face of an angel. The glory of God shone upon him, and while he was beholding the face of his Lord, the enemies of Christ stoned him to death. Would we not think that a hard death to die? But the fear of death was gone, and his last breath was spent in petitioning the Lord to forgive his persecutors.",
