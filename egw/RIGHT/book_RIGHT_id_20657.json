    "word": "When those who are preaching the truth practice the truth in every deed, heavenly messengers will be in the assemblies that they address, impressing on the hearts of the hearers the words spoken. The shadow that Satan throws across the pathway to eclipse the light of heaven will be pierced by the bright shining of the Sun of Righteousness. How sad it is that the faith of ministers and church members falls so far short of what it might be. If their eyes could be opened, they would see light from heaven shining, the clouds of doubt dispersing, and truth finding entrance to hearts.",
