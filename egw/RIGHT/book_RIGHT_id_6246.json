    "word": "No one whose hands are defiled with sin, or whose heart is not right with God, should have any part in the work of the canvasser or the colporteur; for such persons will surely dishonor the cause of truth. Those who are workers in the missionary field need God to guide them. They should be careful to start right, and then press quietly and firmly on in the path of rectitude. They should be decided; for Satan is determined and persevering in his efforts for their overthrow.",
