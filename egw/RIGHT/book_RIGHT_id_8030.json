Their hearts are filled with these thoughts, and they flow out from the abundance of the heart, as though these things were their grand aim in life, their highest attainment. They forget the words of Christ, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" Matthew 6:33.",
