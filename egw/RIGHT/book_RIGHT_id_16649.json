    "word": "Let all who are connected with this sanitarium labor to make it a model institution, where the living principles of righteousness shall prevail. Our institutions for the care of the sick and suffering are to stand upon the elevated platform of truth. They are to carry out the eternal principles of equity and righteousness. Those who are working in them are to weigh their actions in the scales of justice, and practise strict equity. God desires every man and every woman in His service to stand before Him in purity and truth, obedient to all His commandments. Cleanness of spirit must be preserved wherever the light of truth is to shine forth. All the workers in our sanitariums should ever remember that they are laboring in institutions dedicated to the Lord. \n     October 24, 1902. \n\n\n                                                       [4]",
