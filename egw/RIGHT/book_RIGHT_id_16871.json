    "word": "PH167 - Counsels to Physicians and Medical Students (1885)\n\n\n     The Lord is soon to come. Perilous times are before us, and never was there a period when the exhortation of the Apostle--2 Corinthians 6:14-18--was more appropriate than now. \"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\" This is the important work before us, to separate ourselves in spirit and in practice from the world, if we would comply with the conditions to become sons and daughters of God. The Apostle urges home the advantages thus presented, that we should lay hold of them as special blessings. \"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\" Here is earnest work \n\n\n                            -2- \n\nfor every one of us; right thoughts, pure and holy purposes, will not come to us naturally; they must be sought for and encouraged.",
