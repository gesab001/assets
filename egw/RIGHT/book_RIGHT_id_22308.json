    "word": "Do not any one think, that there we have got all the truth we need; we have got the main pillars of the faith, and if we are right there we have no need to trouble ourselves that we may understand the truth ourselves. One minister who has been in the work for years and years, says, \"Now, Sister White, have we got to understand ourselves? There are reasons that are from the Bible in \n                                                                           564\nregard to the points of our faith; why can't we take them, as others have prepared them, and then we need not take that time; and we proclaim it. We believe these to be men of God (and there was one man mentioned). Don't you believe that he was inspired of God?\" No, I do not. I do not believe any such thing. I believe that God has given him a work to do. And if there is a man or a woman who is not consecrated and devoted to God every hour, I do not care who they are, the enemy will slip in some of self--weave it right in, his peculiar traits, his peculiar ideas--and the first thing, he is molding others, he is putting his fashion upon those who are around him. It is dangerous business to exalt man, or to lean upon man, to make flesh our arm. What we want is to lean upon the arm that has been stretched out for us to lean upon, and that is the Lord God of Israel, and in Him we may trust.",
