    "word": "By the managers of the Sanitarium, and the leaders in the medical missionary work, there has been a binding up with the world, which has led to entanglement, There has been much working upon a wrong policy. One man has embraced so many responsibilities that it is impossible for him to give to each proper thought that a careful performance of the Lord's work requires. Men who will carry forward in right lines the work for this time, should rally around the leaders in the work, sharing the responsibilities that they are now carrying, bringing all their plans before their brethren for consideration. Whenever one man devises plans, and seeks to carry them out in a manner so determined that his work savors of oppression, there is need of bringing into connection with him other minds that will keep uplifted the high standard suggested by the name we bear.",
