    "word": "Though Paul was at last confined in a Roman prison\u2014shut away from the light and air of heaven, cut off from his active labors in the gospel, and momentarily expecting to be condemned to death\u2014yet he did not yield to doubt or despondency. From that gloomy dungeon came his dying testimony, full of a sublime faith and courage that has inspired the hearts of saints and martyrs in all succeeding ages. His words fitly describe the results of that sanctification which we have in these pages endeavored to set forth: \"I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing\" 2 Timothy 4:6-8.
