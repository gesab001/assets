    "word": "While in Fresno, Zua made the remark that she wanted to go down the street and purchase a silk duster and a new dress. She also said, \"If I had a daughter I would send her to Snell's Seminary, for it is a superior place to learn good manners.\" What does such talk indicate? Does it not show that labor should be put forth to save the soul of your own child? Do \n\n\n                        [49] \n\nyou think that in thus educating her you have placed her where she will love God and the truth? She has only attained a superficial education; real knowledge, which is of more value than everything else besides, she has yet to gain; she has yet to learn her poor self and to obtain a knowledge of her God. As her father and mother, you need to take heed to yourselves that you may set a right example before her. You should be constantly guarded that you do not encourage in her a love of dress. You should learn to know when to spare and when to spend. We cannot be Christ's followers unless we deny self and lift the cross. You should pay up squarely as you go; gather up the drop stitches; bind off your raveling edges, and know just what you can call your own. You should reckon up all the littles spent in self-gratification. You should notice what is used simply to gratify taste and in cultivating a perverted, epicurean appetite. The money expended for useless delicacies might be used to add to your substantial home comforts and conveniences. You are not to be penurious, you are to be honest with yourself and your brethren. Penuriousness is an abuse of God's bounties. Lavishness is also an abuse. The little outgoes that you think of as not worth mentioning, amount to considerable in the end.",
