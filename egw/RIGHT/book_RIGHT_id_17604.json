    "word": "\"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot: they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.\" There is need that we eat and drink; but when men allow the gratification of appetite to occupy their thoughts and time to the neglect of their eternal interests, it is a sin for which God will punish them; for they abuse their bodies, destroy health, unbalance the mind, and strengthen the animal propensities. Then they are led by Satan to do the very things that awaken the sword of justice against them. Christians are to seek those things that are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. All the warnings given, all the appeals made, do not seem to alarm those who indulge perverted appetite. They go on in sinful indulgence, and their conscience is seared as with a hot iron. They will put their own interpretation on their sinful course, saying, \"I have done no moral wrong.\" Clear discernment is needed--the spiritual eyesalve, which we can obtain only by becoming partakers of the divine nature.",
