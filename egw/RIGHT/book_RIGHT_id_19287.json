    "word": "As Christ bowed upon Jordan's banks after His baptism, there was a bright light that descended like a dove of burnished gold and lighted upon Him, and from heaven was heard a voice saying, \"This is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased\" (Matthew 3:17). We read over these words, but do not take in their significance. We do not seem to understand their value to us. They are stating to you that you are accepted in the Beloved. Christ with His long human arm encircles the fallen race, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Almighty, thus uniting earth with heaven, and fallen, finite man with the Infinite God. And this earth, which was divorced from heaven, is again united with heaven. A [means of] communication is opened with heaven through Jesus Christ, that man, who was fallen, is brought back again into favor with God. Here Jesus passed into the wilderness of temptation, and the trial is brought to bear upon Him one hundred times more trying than that brought upon Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. And will He endure the temptation?",
