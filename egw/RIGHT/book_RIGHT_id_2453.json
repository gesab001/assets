    "word": "Teacher, weed from your talks all that is not of the highest and best quality. Keep before the students those sentiments only that are essential. Never should the physician, minister, or teacher prolong his talks until the alpha is forgotten in long-drawn-out assertions that are not of the least benefit. When this is done, the mind is swamped with a multitude of words that it cannot retain. Let the talks given be short and right to the point. Let the mind be kept sweet and pure, and open to heaven's first law, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\" Luke 10:27. If those who act a part in the training of the youth will leave many things unsaid, and present before the students the importance of the principles they must obey in order to have eternal life, there will be seen a work of true reform.",
