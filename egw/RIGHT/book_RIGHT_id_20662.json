    "word": "We are altogether too selfish, too exclusive. The rays of light shining upon us we are to reflect to others. God expects everyone who enjoys His grace to diffuse this grace as freely as Christ bestows His mercies. As the sun shines upon the just and the unjust, so the Sun of Righteousness reflects light to the whole world. Why should those who have been made partakers of the heavenly gift be so exclusive? Why men should try to keep their light to themselves, instead of letting it shine forth to the world, is a marvel to the heavenly universe. \n                                                                -",
