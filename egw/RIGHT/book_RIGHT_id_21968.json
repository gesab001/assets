I am instructed to say that all the preliminaries connected with the management of the medical missionary work are not to proceed from Dr. Kellogg. It is the deceptive power of the enemy of all righteousness that leads Dr. Kellogg to endeavor to bring all our medical institutions under the control of one organization. Certainly such an effort is not inspired of the Lord. The medical missionary work is God's work, and in every church we are to take a decided stand against every phase of this kind of proceeding.",
