    "word": "A Question of Rights\n     Satan will tempt those who have been taught by God to make healthful foods to say, when others use the productions of earth and tree in making foods that may perhaps be somewhat similar, that they are infringing on their rights. But God never designed that a few men should monopolize the advantages of the food interests, forcing others, who need the same advantage, to bind themselves to fulfill certain conditions. -MS 159, 1902. Written December 15, 1902.",
