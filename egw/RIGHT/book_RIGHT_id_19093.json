    "word": "You could be of far more use to make up your mind contentedly to do what you can as Providence opens the way, and in doing this can be of far greater use than to push your own way forward and lose your liberty and your helpless family be left without a protector. Your children need a father. You should teach your children habits of industry. You are not willing they should learn the power of endurance. Useful employment would keep your oldest son out of evil habits. If you cannot teach him to labor you should put him in the care of a judicious man who could teach him to be useful. You have a work to do here right in your own family.",
