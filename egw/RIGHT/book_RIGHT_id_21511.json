    "word": "No man should go out to teach the truth unless he has had training and knows how to use the ability and capabilities God has given him. Now, you would not think of such a thing as going to a man who never worked at the carpenter trade and asking him to put you up a fine building; and so it is in God's work. God wants you to learn, and the angels will be right by [you] to impress your mind, and if you will go to the Scriptures as Daniel did, you will understand all God would have you understand. As you learn to practice, and learn to teach, [teach others] as God commanded Timothy to take the things He had given him and commit them to faithful men who would be able to teach others also. Now this is the very work to be done in New York. Let the mind be elevated, ennobled, sanctified, and then the minister will not be worked to death and you can take them and drill them in the truth, and their hearts be burning with it and they want to tell it to others.",
