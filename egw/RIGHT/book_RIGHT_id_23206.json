    "word": "Sister White: Well, I can not tell you. This is what I was saying: In the visions of the night, in a meeting, I said: \"Brother Reaser, why did not you feel an interest in that sanitarium, to create a fund so that it should not have so large a debt? Which was of the greatest consequence,-- was it of the greatest consequence to take up that school, in which the parents and so many friends were interested and could all exert an influence,--which was of the greatest consequence?\" Thus I was talking right to you in the meeting. \"Now,\" said I, \"which is of the greatest consequence, Brother Reaser? Is it a sanitarium that is to stand as a constant voice and influence, that shall bring in all classes of minds, and all kinds of persons, some in poverty and some with influence? Or is it a school?\" I thought, Brother Burden, you were present also. . .",
