    "word": "God's government extends to all the works of his hands. Nothing is so great or so exalted that it is above his direction and control. Nothing is so small and obscure that it is beneath his notice. Whatever, to short-sighted mortals, the present appearances may seem to be, all the ways of the Lord are truth and righteousness. The universal and perfect government of God is a source of unspeakable joy to those who love him and exalt his laws.",
