    "word": "There are those who make efforts to carry matters according to their own ideas and preferences. Take heed; do not let human wisdom lead you to divert means into new channels before the work is perfected in places where important enterprises have already been started. But understand that this is not meant to hinder any individual worker from entering any place to which he is directed by the Spirit of God to do house-to-house work. This is work that ought to be done. All the efforts that can be made should be made to reach the people in every place. But it is not right for our workers to make a large outlay of means in a place just because human ambition has been aroused.",
