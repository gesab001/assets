    "word": "The Lord looks upon such ones with great displeasure. His counsel to us is: \"It is the duty of each one to do all in his power to put down strife for the supremacy. It grieves the Lord to see the unwise, injudicious encouragement given to those who are so ready to make unfavorable reports concerning the work of others. \n                                                                           48\nMany stand by as criticizers, ready to make a man an offender for a word. Unless they put on the robe of Christ's righteousness, they will be rejected by God. Let them study carefully the parable of the man who came to the wedding supper not having on the garment provided for the guests. Let them remember that, while they are watching and criticizing others, they are neglecting to put on the robe of Christ's righteousness.\"",
