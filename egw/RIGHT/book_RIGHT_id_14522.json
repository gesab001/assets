    "word": "My dear brethren and sisters in -----, many have been rebelling against health reform. Many have been warring against Dr. -----, as if he were the one who originated the principles of health reform. To such ones I would say, In treating these principles as something that you should resist, have you not acted foolishly? In rejecting health reform, you have not been rejecting Dr. -----, but rather the One who in mercy has given you these principles. For about forty years, the Lord Himself has been sending you instruction, line upon line, precept upon precept. You need to practice health reform just as conscientiously as does Dr. -----. It will lead to the restoration of both physical and spiritual health. When you place yourselves in right relation to God, you will accept the medical missionary work as a work to which you have been appointed by the great Master-Worker.",
