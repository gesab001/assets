    "word": "Right principles are to be strenuously maintained by the people who claim to be chosen of God. The work in our institutions is to be as open as the day. The people have a perfect right to know what is done in these institutions. They are not to be left in ignorance as to how the money they donate to the cause of God is appropriated. And those in positions of responsibility in our institutions are not to grasp the highest wages. Do not repeat the experience of the past fifteen years. Christ says, \"Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\" That which makes the burden so grievously heavy is to have to meet the influence of men who have the intense desire to be original, to bring in a new order of things. Men who know little of practical godliness and true Christian service have been placed first as leaders. \n\n                                               -",
