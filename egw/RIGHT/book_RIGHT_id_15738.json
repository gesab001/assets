    "word": "The bright and cheerful side of our religion will be represented by all who are daily consecrated to God.... We do not want to dishonor God by the mournful relation of trials that appear grievous. All trials that are received as educators will produce joy. The whole religious life will be uplifting, elevating, ennobling, fragrant with good words and works. The enemy is well pleased to have souls complaining and stumbling their way along, depressed, downcast, mourning, and groaning; because Satan wants just such impressions made as to the effects of our faith. God designs that the mind shall take no low level.--Manuscript 70, Nov. 6, 1897, \"Diary.\"",
