    "word": "Under these influences, combined with the influence of careful treatment and wholesome food, the sick find health. The feeble step recovers its elasticity. The eye regains its brightness. The hopeless become hopeful. The once despondent countenance wears an expression of cheerfulness. The complaining tones of the voice give place to tones of content. The words express the belief, \"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.\" Psalm 46:1. The clouded hope of the Christian is brightened. Faith returns. The word is heard, \"Yea, \n                                                                           168\nthough I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.\" \"My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\" \"He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might He increaseth strength.\" Psalm 23:4; Luke 1:46, 47; Isaiah 40:29. The acknowledgment of God's goodness in providing these blessings invigorates the mind. God is very near and is pleased to see His gifts appreciated.",
