    "word": "Some years ago the matter of publication of books came up, and plans were laid which I cannot now fully call to mind. A decision was made something like this: that no one individual was to be benefited by the publication of his own book. A proposition was then made to us which my husband, without ability to fully consider, assented to, that the Publishing Association should have the benefit of his books. I was considering the matter, and thought like this: I wish the Testimonies to go to as many as possible: they are a message from God to this people, and I wish no personal benefit from this work. Thus we stated the matter. But shortly after I was shown that this was not wisdom, to relinquish our right to control our own writings: for we would know better how to use the profits of these books, than would those who had far less experience; publications were to be multiplied, and the profits we would receive would enable us to lead out in the advancing work, to build up the interests of the cause, and to carry others with us in the work. There was a principle to be maintained to guard the interests of the true workers. We were not the only ones who would be affected by this decision. Justice must be maintained: the cause of God would be continually widening, it would embrace the whole world as its field: the wants of the cause would not be determined by one man's mind and one man's obscure vision: there would be important work done in God's moral vineyard, and no man should feel that that part of the work over which he presides is to swallow all other interests.",
