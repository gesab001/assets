    "word": "We must not be discouraged if there are only a few that believe the present truth. It is not the great numbers that follow Christ. In answer to the question, \"Are there few that be saved?\" The reply was, \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\" Luke 13:24. \"Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\" Matthew 7:14. Now we see only a few who regard the commandments of God, and those who will not lift the cross after having a knowledge of their duty will finally meet their destruction. We should not turn to the right or to the left, for if we do we shall find a dish of fables in place of truth.",
