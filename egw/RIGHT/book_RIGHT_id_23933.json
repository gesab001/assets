    "word": "There is a work of a superior order to be done. A clear understanding of business matters will qualify men to conduct business for the work and the cause of God, to keep it upon a high and holy basis. The missionary work, in all its branches, needs wise, careful, judicious men, who have ability and experience to act in the capacity of treasurers - men who will prove trustworthy in bringing the truth before the men in the highways, and who will bring all the advantages of their experience, their soundness of principle, their unbending integrity and uprightness into the work to which they are appointed. Faith unfeigned in its largeness and fullness is wanted just now. \n\n\n                                       (Signed) E. G. White.",
