    "word": "In regard to Corliss coming to the coast, we are inclined to think it all right. I think the matter was managed in such a way as to lead him to feel that he was of great consequence, and there will be a reaction. All was said that could be said in the paper to call him to the field he had purposed to come [to]. No more parade should have been made over the matter and no more could be said than was said. What has held him may be a waiting for a most earnest invitation with a list of names or a petition for [him] to come to the coast. But we felt forbidden to do or say anything further. This sudden change of feelings in reference to Corliss I fear may prove his injury. These strong moves to lift up and to cast down are fearfully damaging to the usefulness of our ministers.",
