    "word": "The law of God is the great standard of righteousness. This the apostle declares is holy, just, and good. David says, \"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul\" (Psalm 19:7). Christ says, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments.\" . . . \"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him\" (John 14:15, 21). This is most assuredly the witness of the Spirit. . . . \"If ye keep my commandments\"--from the heart--\"ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love\" (John 15:10).",
