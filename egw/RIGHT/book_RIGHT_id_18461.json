    "word": "It would seem that I have written enough, that there is no need of my urging this subject upon you further. But I tell you in truth that I clearly understand what I am doing. Sufficient light has been given you. But for several years you have not heeded this light. If you had wished to know what the Lord has said, you could have known; for you have the books that have been written under the guidance of His Spirit. You have all the directions that could be asked for to point out the right way. Direct light has been sent you. But you have looked upon this as of less importance than your own plans and devisings. If you had heeded the testimonies sent you, Living Temple would never have been written.--Letter 253, 1903, pp. 4-11, 13. (To J. H. Kellogg, November 20, 1903.)",
