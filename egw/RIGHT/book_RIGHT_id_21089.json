    "word": "I am directed to impress upon you that you must have a stronger faith in God. Hold fast to the only source of strength. Then right where you are you will be a living epistle, known and read of all men. Faith is not sight. God requires you to bring into every phase of your character and into your work all the attractiveness possible, and Jesus Christ, His meekness, His love, His unselfishness. Let not the thought come into your mind that you must do battle for yourself because you think that your brethren in the faith make wrong moves and do not appreciate your work. This opinion will not change God's estimate of your character.",
