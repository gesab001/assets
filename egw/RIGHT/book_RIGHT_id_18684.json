    "word": "There is a higher standard for us to reach than we have yet reached. We must be cleansed from all unrighteousness. Paul says, \"I have not ceased to warn you from house to house.\" Why did he do this? Because the law was transgressed. He himself, when he saw his true condition, exercised repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Let no one think that while he is living in transgression he will be allowed to enter \n\n\n                                    -256- \n\nthe gates of the holy city. Those who when Christ comes are in rebellion against God will not be admitted to the courts above. No rebel will enter heaven.",
