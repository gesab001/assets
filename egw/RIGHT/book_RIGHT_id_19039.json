    "word": "If we would only see and appreciate the Lord's goodness and love and His unceasing care for us, how changed this world would be. If we would seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, the principles of righteousness would guide our lives, and self-seeking would find no place in our hearts. The desire to do our own will would be submerged into the desire to do the will of God. We need to cherish a constant realization of God's love and goodness. We need to remember that He holds us accountable for the use that we make of the gifts that He has bestowed on us.--Letter 166, 1903, pp. 4, 5. (To Brother and Sister Kress, August 4, 1903.)",
