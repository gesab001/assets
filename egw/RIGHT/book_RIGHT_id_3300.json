The God-given mind, which should be kept clear, is perverted by the use of narcotics. The brain is no longer able to distinguish correctly. The enemy has control. Man has sold his reason for that which makes him mad. He has no sense of what is right. Yet the liquor curse is legalized, and works untold ruin in the hands of those who love to tamper with that which not only ruins the poor victim but his whole family.",
