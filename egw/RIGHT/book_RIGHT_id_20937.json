    "word": "I feel the burden of souls upon me. When I speak before an audience consisting mostly of unbelievers, I find that they are far more deeply moved than our own brethren and sisters. Thus it was at Ballarat. Canright's books have been freely circulated there, and the people came out in large numbers to our meetings. As they listened the tears rolled down many faces, and often earnest responses were made. At the close the people pressed around me and expressed their joy at hearing such plain and glorious truth. The simplicity, they said, was unlike anything they had heard. Others said, \"God has spoken to us through you today. I shall never forget the words, the blessed words, you have given us.\" I feel grateful to God that His Holy Spirit does impress the hearts of the people. Without Christ I can do nothing. He must draw the soul by His own matchless grace, and He will do this if the heart does not stubbornly resist His love.",
