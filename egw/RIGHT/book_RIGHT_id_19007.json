    "word": "If sinners repent, their pardon is procured through the merits of Christ. Those who understand this matter in its true bearing will more fully comprehend the wondrous, glorious plan of salvation. They will not desire to argue over just what is meant by Christ being our righteousness; nor will they desire to try to explain questions that do not in any way make more plain the terms of salvation. It is not essential to understand the precise particulars in regard to the relation of the two laws. It is of far greater consequence that we know whether we are justified or condemned by the Holy precepts of God's law.",
