    "word": "The words of Christ to the self-righteous Pharisee were these,- \"Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.

The difficulties mentioned are the ones to be met in almost every place: but not in so manifest a form as in Palmerston. We think Satan has made his seat in that place to work out his deeds that the laborers shall be discouraged, and give it up.",
