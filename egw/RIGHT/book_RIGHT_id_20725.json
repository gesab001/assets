    "word": "Your work is most difficult and trying, and you must have Jesus close beside you every moment, as a counselor, as a refuge wherein you may run and be safe. Do not allow your thoughts to get wrought up over any of the vexatious troubles that are constantly arising. Keep calm and think of Jesus, who is close by your side, and what you can do to please Him on this occasion. Aim to represent Christ, and then you can act manfully, nobly; and the grace of Christ, the Holy Spirit, which is God's gift for you to grasp, will strengthen you with all might in the inner man. Then your nerves will not be worn threadbare; but you will ever educate your thoughts to look to Jesus to right every wrong and to build you up in the faith, to stand with you in your critical work with suffering humanity, and give you a continual increase of faith and trust and assurance that you will never be confounded.",
