    "word": "It was only a few moments, as we were going down a thoroughfare, the horse began to kick, and Brother Reekie turned him into a side street, out of the press of carriages; but he kicked and kicked; his heels went crushing through the dashboard.

Thud, thud, went his steel-clad heels into the carriage.",
