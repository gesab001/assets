    "word": "Chap. 10 - General Principles\n\n\n\"The Lord give thee\nunderstanding in all things.\"\n\nThe Right Education\n\n\n     It is the nicest work ever assumed by men and women to deal with youthful minds. The greatest care should be taken in the education of youth, to vary the manner of instruction so as to call forth the high and noble powers of the mind. Parents and schoolteachers are certainly disqualified to educate children properly if they have not first learned the lessons of self-control, patience, forbearance, gentleness, and love. What an important position for parents, guardians, and teachers! There are very few who realize the most essential wants of the mind, and how to direct the developing intellect, the growing thoughts and feelings of youth. . . .",
