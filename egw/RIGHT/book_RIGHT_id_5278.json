    "word": "The Jewish nation was represented as the fig-tree which God had planted in his vineyard. This people he had taken unto himself as his own. They had been greatly favored with temporal and spiritual blessings, and he looked to them to bring forth the fruits of righteousness. Year after year he had come to them hoping to find fruit, but had found none. He had been long forbearing. Justice had urged, \u201cCut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?\u201d But mercy pleaded for still another trial. The Dresser of the vineyard will put forth yet one more effort to save the fruitless tree. The Son of God will come in person to plead with the chosen people. He will take upon himself humanity, and set before them the example of his own life. If this fails to bring them to repentance, it is their last trial. \u201cAfter that thou shalt cut it down.\u201d In the terrible destruction which came upon the Jewish nation we read the fate of the unfruitful tree.",
