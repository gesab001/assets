    "word": "Plants Do Not Grow Through Worry or Conscious Effort.--In place of growing anxious with the thought that you are not growing in grace, just do every duty that presents itself, carry the burden of souls on your heart, and by every conceivable means seek to save the lost. Be kind, be courteous, be pitiful; speak in humility of the blessed hope; talk of the love of Jesus; tell of His goodness, his mercy, and His righteousness; and cease to worry as to whether or not you are growing. Plants do not grow through any conscious effort. . . .The plant is not in continual worriment about its growth; it just grows under the supervision of God.--YI, Feb 3, 1898. (ML 103.)",
