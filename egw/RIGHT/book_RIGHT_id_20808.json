    "word": "I want to tell you, my brother, that the Lord wants honest, upright men here, men as quick and eager to discern, and as wise to judge, in spiritual as in temporal things. Did men as earnestly and perseveringly pursue the one as the other, they would become rich for eternity. While they can strive to obtain temporal things, they must be wide-awake and active in the work of God. They must exercise judgment, they must lay plans and diligently seek for heavenly riches.",
