    "word": "Children Can Learn to Respect Right of Others; to be Molded from Babyhood: \n     Parents, give your time to your children. Teach them to form careful habits. Some parents allow their children to be destructive, to use as playthings that which they have no right to touch. Children should be taught that they must not handle the property of other people. For the comfort and happiness of the family they must be taught to observe the rules of propriety. Children are no happier because they are allowed to handle everything they see. If they are not educated to be care-taking, they will grow up with unlovely, destructive traits of character.",
