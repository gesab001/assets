    "word": "Overlooked Truths to Appear \n\n\n     The Lord designs that in the revelation of truth in all ages, the doctrine of grace shall be gradually unfolded to the comprehension of man. If we follow on to know the Lord, we shall know His going forth is prepared as the morning. His truth unfolds as the obscurity of dawn brightens into the radiance of noonday. We have been fully convinced of this fact in these meetings.",
