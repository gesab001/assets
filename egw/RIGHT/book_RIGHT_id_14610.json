    "word": "This is the most precious reproof and encouragement, the most important lesson for every soul that is trying to serve God. Here is expressed in plain words that in which the Lord delights. All who understand and know God will know Him as One that exercises loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness. If they walk humbly with God they will be enabled to keep the way of the Lord, to do His will in all kindness, compassion, mercy, tenderness, and love, for God has said, \"In these things I delight.\" Then how careful should we be in regard to the fruit of the lips, that we dishonor not God by dealing unkindly with the purchase of His blood. If we express the character of God, we shall be Christian gentlemen and gentlewomen. . . .",
