    "word": "Let the presidents of state conferences walk humbly with God, and they will not have occasion to write to the president of the General Conference to leave his work to settle little matters for them. Even many large matters may be carried to God, and God will give counsel in every state conference. The Lord can be approached by all. He is much more accessible than the president of the General Conference. Let the president of the General Conference educate the presidents of state conferences to take care of their portion of the moral vineyard where they are situated wisely, without laying their burdens upon him. Lead these men who have ability and talent to look to God, that they may be taught by him. Teach them to go to the Fountain head for instruction in righteousness. Search the Scriptures. \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished, unto all good works.\" What, then, is your excuse for turning for counsel from one who is infinite in wisdom to finite men, who are as \n\n\n                     - 15 - \n\nweak as yourselves? One has suffered for you, the just for the unjust.",
