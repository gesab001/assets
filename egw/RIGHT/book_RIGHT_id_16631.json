    "word": "It is right for the workers to counsel together as brethren; but that man who endeavors to lead his fellow-workers to seek his individual counsel and advice regarding the details of their work, and to learn their duty from him, is in a dangerous position, and needs to learn what responsibilities are really comprehended in his office. God has appointed no man to be conscience for his fellow-man. It is not wise to lay so much responsibility upon an officer that he will feel that he is forced to become a dictator.",
