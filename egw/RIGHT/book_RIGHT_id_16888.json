    "word": "Our institutions need to be constantly elevating, purifying, refining. Whatever our condition, there is a Guide; whatever our perplexity, we have a Counselor to teach us the right way. Those who would be devoted servants of the most high God, must serve him with an eye single to his glory. They must be particular, and especially so in a large institution like the Sanitarium. They must not entertain the thought for a moment that it is needless to be so circumspect and reserved in their conversation and deportment, that it is too great a tax. It seemed to Eve a small thing to not exactly obey God, when something for her enjoyment and pleasure was presented to her; and it did not seem possible for Adam to choose the side of right, and condemn the wrong in his best beloved, and he followed her example; but it opened the flood-gates of woe to our world. Offenses may seem very, very small to fallen man, but the sure result is a tide of evil that reveals the defilement and hatefulness of sin. Therefore all who claim to be children of God are called upon to accept, not their own low standard, but the divine standard, and to consider that God is a party in all their transactions. His holiness, his justice, his mercy, and his \n\n\n                             -44- \n\ntruth, are to be interwoven with every transaction of life. Those connected with our institutions cannot afford to separate from God. Their every action, their continual influence, should be to repress the unprincipled and encourage the pure. He that is honest, true and upright toward God, will be upright in his dealings with his fellow-men.",
