    "word": "The Obstinate Man--Obstinacy is a barrier to all improvement.  An obstinate man will not be readily convinced of anything which his sight cannot take in.  He does not know what it means to walk by faith.  He adheres to his own plans and opinions, be they right or wrong, because he has already adopted this line of thought.  He may have abundant reason to see that he is wrong; his brethren may raise their voices against his opinions and his methods for making a success of the work; but he cherishes an almost immovable bar against conviction.",
