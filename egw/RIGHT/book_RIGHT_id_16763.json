    "word": "When the Poor Have Done Their Part \n\n     There are men of wealth who will accept the last message, if the right kind of labor is put forth. The Lord has made men his stewards, and has entrusted to them the means to carry forward his work. When the poor have done all they can to advance the cause, the Lord will bring in men of means to carry on the work. G. W. 298, old edition. \n\n                                               -",
