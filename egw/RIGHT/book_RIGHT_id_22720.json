    "word": "God has not singled out a few men, and left others uncared for. He loves the purchase of his blood, and he will not neglect one child and exalt another. He will not lift up one, and cast down and oppress and trample upon another. Every man has individual rights, and it is for the interest of his fellow-men to respect those rights. Any lording it over God's heritage will be charged to the man who ventures to exhibit this presumptuous spirit. Those who are truly converted, those whose characters are shaped after the divine model, will hold the truth in love. It will be far more profitable for men to deal rigorously with themselves, rather than to deal rigorously with God's purchased possession. Those living in these last days need to have a right understanding of many things. We should be careful to treat our fellow-men as we would treat Christ in the person of his saints. Let no one ignore the rights of another. \n                                                                           1376",
