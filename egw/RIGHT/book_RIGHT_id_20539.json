    "word": "Parents can be ministers for Christ in the training of their children. The education of a child begins in its earliest years. From its babyhood it is to be taught to obey. To teach their children this lesson, parents must themselves live in obedience to the Word of God. Parents, teach your children to do what you tell them. And from the grief you experience when they disregard your wishes, learn how you grieve and disappoint Christ when you disobey Him. The effort to bring your children up in the right way will teach you many valuable lessons in regard to your duty to obey the Word of God.",
