    "word": "Several years ago it was presented to me that the Gentile world should be called upon to make donations to our work in the Southern field.

Let them tell about the Huntsville school, about the orphanage that we desire to build there, and about the colored mission schools that are needed all over the southern States. Let the needs of this work be presented by men who understand how to reach the hearts of men of means.
