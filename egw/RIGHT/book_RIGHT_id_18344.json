    "word": "Let your conduct be such as will do credit to your father and mother and to your grandparents. We feel a reverence for the aged and we want to show them respect whenever you meet them. I am pained as I travel from place to place to see how little respect and reverence is manifest by youth of this age toward men and women of gray hairs. Ever treat the aged with marked respect, be they strangers or acquaintances and relatives. If your grandfather and grandmother advise or reprove you, show them respect by heeding their counsel as readily as you would ours. God will bless you children if you will do right.--Letter 15, 1867. (To \"Dear Children Edson and Willie,\" November 9, 1867.)",
