    "word": "Christ's work was to unify. \"These words spake Jesus, and lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee; as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given them. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.\" The right knowledge of the truth, God and of Jesus Christ, the world's Redeemer, brings eternal life to the receiver,--spiritual life in this human existence and eternal life in the kingdom of God.",
