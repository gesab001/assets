    "word": "If our brethren will carefully study this question, they will see that it is not right to encourage the establishment of additional sanitariums in a locality where the one already in operation is all that can be properly sustained. It is neither according to principles of justice nor good policy to divide between two institutions the support and patronage that are needed to maintain and meet the expenses of one. One sanitarium well managed usually requires all the patronage of the community in which it is established. A second institution stands directly in the way of the first.",
