    "word": "The day of God's vengeance is just upon us. The seal of God will be placed upon the foreheads of those only who sigh and cry for the abominations done in the land. Those who link in sympathy with the world are eating and drinking with the drunken, and will surely be destroyed with the workers of iniquity. \"The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are open unto their cry;\" but \"the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.\" Psalm 34:15, 16.",
