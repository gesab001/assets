    "word": "Canvassers Expect to Be Helped\nWhen they get into difficulty, some canvassers expect that money is to be drawn from the treasury to help them out, only to get into strait places again, and again to require help. Those who are stewards of the means in the treasury must keep a sharp lookout to see that the supply is not exhausted by these drafts. When men cannot by canvassing bring into the treasury every dollar that belongs to it rightly, let them stop just where \n67\nthey are. They should not engage in canvassing unless they can bring means into the treasury, instead of robbing it.",
