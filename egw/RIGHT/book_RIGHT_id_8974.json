    "word": "He that abideth in Christ is perfected in the love of God, and his purposes, thoughts, words, and actions are in harmony with the will of God expressed in the commandments of His law. There is nothing in the heart of the man who abides in Christ that is at war with any precept of God's law. Where the Spirit of Christ is in the heart, the character of Christ will be revealed, and there will be manifested gentleness under provocation, and patience under trial. \"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.\" Righteousness can be defined only by God's great moral standard, the Ten Commandments. There is no other rule by which to measure character.--Signs of the Times, June 20, 1895.",
