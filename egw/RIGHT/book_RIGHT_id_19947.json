    "word": "There are those who criticize everything in which they have not voice or influence. Such ones weave selfishness into their work. Let those who have been reproved for criticizing cease this unkind, unchristlike work. If they have wisdom to do the work of God, let them go into some city where the truth has not been proclaimed, and work as self-supporting missionaries. Let them show what they can do, instead of pointing out the mistakes made by those who have put all their strength of mind and body into the work, and who have striven with all their might to bring the work to its present stage of advancement. The Lord is not with those who, instead of putting themselves in the place of the workers who are sacrificing, stand by as onlookers, criticizing what they think is not right. \n\n\n                                     -49-",
