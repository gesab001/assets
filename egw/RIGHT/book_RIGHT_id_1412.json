    "word": "Learn in the School of Christ.--As students, you are ever to be learning in the school of Christ; you are to bring your entrusted capital of physical and mental energy into your work. God will not accept of a divided heart. There are men and women who should be educating themselves for canvassers, and for Bible readers [Bible instructors]. They should put away every unholy thought and corrupting practice, that they may be sanctified through the truth. They should be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Nothing less than the power of God will make and keep you right. You are to offer to God nothing less than your best. You should do better and better work as you put in practice what you learn. --Review and Herald, May 20, 1890.",
