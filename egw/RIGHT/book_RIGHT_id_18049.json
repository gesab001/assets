    "word": "\"TODAY WE MUST ENTER INTO CONSIDERATION OF SANITARIUM PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY THE QUESTION OF THE WAGES WE SHOULD PAY TO PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS. WE HAVE IN OUR ST. HELENA SANITARIUM A GOD-FEARING PHYSICIAN WHO HAS WON THE CONFIDENCE OF ALL HIS ASSOCIATES,--A MAN WHOM GOD HAS BLESSED GREATLY IN HIS MINISTRY TO THE SICK. HE WANTS TO REMAIN, AND EVERYBODY WANTS HIM TO REMAIN; AND HE FEELS THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR HIM TO REMAIN IF HIS BRETHREN COULD GRANT HIM A WAGE ABOUT TWICE AS LARGE AS THAT PAID TO OUR AVERAGE WORKERS. HE LOVES TO GIVE FREELY, AND HE WISHES TO HAVE FUNDS WITH WHICH TO LIVE AND TO USE FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE ARE MUCH PERPLEXED, AND WE WOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY LIGHT ON THIS MATTER.\"",
