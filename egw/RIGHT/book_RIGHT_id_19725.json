    "word": "Brother B, you have no idea of how the discord that has existed between you and your wife has worn upon her mind. When you leave her free to act toward her mother as her conscience tells her that she should act, a terrible strain will be removed from her. In the past she has not been free. She has had little opportunity to be with her mother, and at the same time you have been a great deal away from her, engaged as you have been in the canvassing work. She has been placed where she could not help her mother as she desired to. She had a right to expect that her marriage with you would give her mother a son who would be a help and blessing to the family.",
