    "word": "It is of the greatest importance that ministers and workers set a right example. If they hold and practise lax, loose principles, their example is quoted by those who love to talk rather than to practise, as a full vindication of their course of action. Every mistake that is made grieves the heart of Jesus, and does injury to the influence of the truth, which is the power of God for the salvation of souls. The whole synagogue of Satan watches for mistakes in the lives of those who are seeking to represent Christ, and the most is made of every defection.",
