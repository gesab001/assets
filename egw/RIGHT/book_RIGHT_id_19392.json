    "word": "Christ's great object in sending His Spirit was to convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. \"Of sin,\" He said, \"because they believe not on Me; Of righteousness, because I go to My Father, and ye see Me no more; Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged\" (John 16:9-11). Standing as He was in the very shadow of the cross, He longed to say many things to His disciples, but He declared, \"Ye cannot bear them now\" (verse 12).--Letter 133, 1899, pp. 5a-8. (To \"Dear Children,\" September 10, 1899.)",
