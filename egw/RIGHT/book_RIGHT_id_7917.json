    "word": "United with Christ, all the power you require will be given you. Abiding in Him, you can fight manfully.

Looking beyond yourself to a crucified Saviour, a risen and ascended Lord, who is, as your Advocate, making intercession for you, taking hold of Christ's power and efficiency, you can conquer.",
