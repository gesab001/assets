    "word": "MR No. 1176 - False Humility\n\n     Those who presume to think that they stand accepted on account of their ministerial commission, their multitudinous duties and exercises of devotion, make a grave mistake. Often their lips express a poverty of soul that their heart does not acknowledge. While speaking to God of poverty of spirit, of the defections of others, the heart is swelling with the conceit of their superior humility, the exercise of their superior righteousness. This is humility upon stilts. When the Lord touches their defects by reproof, they do not receive it, or believe it.--Letter 45, 1897. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. February 13, 1986",
