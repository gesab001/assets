    "word": "Time for preaching, study, and visitation must each be kept in balance.--The ministers of the Word are God's chosen agency to spread the knowledge of His will; but there is too little of a missionary spirit, even among our ministers. After preaching the Word, some confine themselves almost wholly to reading and study, to the neglect of other and vitally important duties. While it is right to devote some time to study, every minister should feel a deep interest to do all that it is possible for him to do for the salvation of souls for whom Christ died. He should visit the people, and with care and wisdom seek to interest them in spiritual things.--RH July 10, 1883.",
