    "word": "I had hoped that these matters would be straightened out at this conference. I hope that after the many decided warnings that have been sent to our medical workers at Battle Creek, they would take a stand for the right, and remove the stumbling blocks out of the way.

The students who have gone to Battle Creek to obtain an education in medical missionary lines are in danger of receiving specious errors. In the name of the Lord I say to our people: Let your children receive instruction in medical missionary lines from those who are true and loyal to the faith which has been delivered to the people of God under the ministration of the Holy Spirit. Amidst the perils of these last days, this truth is to shine forth as a lamp that burneth.",
