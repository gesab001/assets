    "word": "What we want is Jesus. What we want is His love. What we want is the elevation and ennobling of character. What we want is to die to self right here--not wait until some future period. We want to make the consecration here. Oh, I am so thankful that it is not too late for us to be righteous. I am so thankful we have a Jesus. I am so thankful that He is able to cleanse us from all sin! I am so thankful that I can hope for His blessing. I am so thankful that I can hide in Him now, and that I can accept His light and give it forth to others. May the Lord breathe upon us His Holy Spirit, and may we grow up into Christ, our living Head. We want this salvation today. We don't want to wait; we don't want to dispel Christ by our unbelief. We want to take right hold of Him because He has told us to do it; and He says--now listen, I want you to hear every word of it--\"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me\" [Isaiah 27:5]. \"Come now, and let us reason together. . . ; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like \n\n\n                                    -193- \n\ncrimson, they shall be as wool\" [Isaiah \n1:18]. Will you come? Will you believe? Will you let Him reason with you? Will you commit the keeping of your soul unto Him as unto a faithful Creator?",
