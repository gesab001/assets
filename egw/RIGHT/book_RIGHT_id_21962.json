    "word": "My brother, I wish to write a few words to you confidentially in regard to the Doctor; Do not let him beguile you by his statements. Some may be true; some are not true. He may suppose that all his assertions are true; but you should neither think that they are, nor encourage him to believe that he is right. I know that he is not in harmony with the Lord. Do not sanction his effort to gather from every source all the means possible for his line of the work; for God does not favor so great an outlay of means as is now being made in Battle Creek; not does He favor the way that the Doctor is managing the health food business. \n\n\n                                -60-",
