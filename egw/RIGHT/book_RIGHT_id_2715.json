    "word": "I have missed you so very much since we parted. I feared when we left you that you would be sick. I could not explain your symptoms, only that a slow fever was upon you. Just trust yourself in the hands of God without anxiety, without fear. God is the rewarder of them who diligently seek Him. The fervent, effectual prayer of the righteous availeth much. Our prayers will not be in vain. \"Ask, and ye shall receive.\"  God alone can bring up Lucinda. She has given herself to God. She is His property. He will not forget the sacrifice she has made for the Lord. He will work for her and none can hinder. Only have faith. How I long to see you and make earnest intercessions for you. We are doing this where we are, far from you, but Jesus knows it all. He can hear from here and bless you there just as well. . . .",
