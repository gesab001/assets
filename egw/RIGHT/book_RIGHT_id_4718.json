    "word": "Before any can enter the mansions of the blest, their cases must be investigated, and their characters and their deeds must pass in review before God. All are to be judged according to the things written in the books, and to be rewarded as their works have been. This Judgment does not take place at death. Mark the words of Paul: \u201cHe hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained: \n549\nwhereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.\u201d [Acts 17:31.] Here the apostle plainly stated that a specified time, then future, had been fixed upon for the Judgment of the world.",
