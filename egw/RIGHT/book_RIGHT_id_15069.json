    "word": "\"Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever \n smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn \n to him the other also.\" Matthew 5:39, R.V. \n\n\n     Occasions of irritation to the Jews were constantly arising from their contact with the Roman soldiery. Detachments of troops were stationed at different points throughout Judea and Galilee, and their presence reminded the people of their own degradation as a nation.
