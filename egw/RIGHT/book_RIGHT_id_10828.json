    "word": "All classes, however fallen, however sin-stained, have the law of God as their guide, and his word as their instructor. They may be sanctified through the truth, and received as sons and daughters of the Most High. But \"the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.\" Romans 8:7. The multitudes do not love righteousness, and they are building on the sand. Many who profess Christ do not love the law of God. If they dared, they would speak out their enmity against it in no mild terms. They have a surface religion, and that is all they desire. Some are deceptive and untrustworthy in deal, and will break pledges and contracts. Covetousness, intemperance, and impurity abound, and money is squandered for tobacco and other similar indulgences. \n                                                                           75",
