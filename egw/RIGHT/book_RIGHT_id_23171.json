    "word": "Christ is the great fountain head of all wisdom, the One who never makes a mistake. All the treasures of heaven were committed to Him that He might impart them to the persevering (398) seeker after truth. The Son of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption. Teachers should bear in mind that He is the great standard for all teachers. Beholding Christ, and studying His teachings, you will learn to appreciate their originality, their authority, their spirituality, their tenderness, their benevolence, and their practicability. All who dig for the treasure of truth will be imbued with the spirit of Christ. By beholding Him, they will be changed into the same image.",
