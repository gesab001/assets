    "word": "Gospel medical missionary workers, as faithful representatives of their Leader, are to bear a message from God. If among this class of workers there should be found those who are not sanctified through the truth; [if there are] those who are unable to work the works of truth and righteousness, who in word and act dishonor the truth and lower the standard that should always be elevated to represent the medical missionary work in its purity, then faithful work is to be done by God's ministers. Like Timothy, they are to \"reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\" \n\n\n                                    -3-",
