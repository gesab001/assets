    "word": "Mothers, do not allow yourselves to be so laden down with cares and responsibilities in the church that you will be unable to fill your rightful place in the home. Your first and most sacred responsibility is so to live in the home life that both you and your children may win the crown of everlasting life. In the fear of God, you are to be the educator of your children. Allow them to help you in every way they can, and show them that you appreciate their help. Let them feel that they are a part of the family firm. \n\n\n                                     -72-",
