    "word": "The Outward Adorning \n\n     Those who cherish and flatter self, fostering pride and vanity, giving to dress and appearance the time and attention \n                                                                           80\nthat ought to be given to the Master's work, are incurring a fearful loss. Many who are clothed in beautiful outward garments know nothing of the inward adorning that is in the sight of God of great price. Their fine clothing covers a heart that is sinful and diseased, full of vanity and pride. They know not what it means to \"seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God\" (Colossians 3:1).",
