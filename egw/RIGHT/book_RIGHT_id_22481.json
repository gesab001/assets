    "word": "The apostle Paul tells us, \"After that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\" This was the carrying out of God's plan for the conviction and conversion of men, who are constantly tempted to magnify their own powers. The Lord would make it manifest whether men by their own finite wisdom could acquire a knowledge of the truth, whether they could know \n                                                                           903\nGod, their Creator. When Christ came to our world, the experiment had been fully made, and it proved the boasted wisdom of men to be but foolishness. Finite wisdom was utterly unable to come to right conclusions in regard to God, and therefore man was wholly incompetent to judge in regard to his law. The Lord has allowed matters in our day to come to a crisis, in the exaltation of error above truth, that he, the God of Israel, might work mightily for the greater elevation of his truth in proportion as error is exalted.",
