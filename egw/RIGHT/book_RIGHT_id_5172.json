    "word": "514. How many frightful accidents occur through the influence of drink. . . . What is the portion of this terrible intoxicant that any man can take, and be safe with the lives of human beings? He can be safe only as he abstains from drink. No intoxicant should pass his lips; then if a disaster comes, men in responsible positions can do their best, and meet their record with satisfaction, whatever may be the issue.--R. and H., 1894, No. 22.",
