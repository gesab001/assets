    "word": "A Strict Account to be Rendered. \n\n     Your mind, your soul, your strength are all the Lord's. None of these talents will be left out by the Master in the reckoning that is soon to be made. We may leave them out of our reckoning, but the Lord measures with exactitude every possibility for service. He has a right to expect us to acquire other talents. The unused capabilities are just as much brought into account as those which we improve. Our talents can only increase by faithful improvement of them. And those who faithfully employ their capabilities in trading upon the Lord's goods will, through their influence, bring many souls to Jesus Christ. \n\n\n                    [16]",
