    "word": "Christ is the light of the world. \"Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings\" (Malachi 4:2). Let the light of His peace shine into your soul. He has a tender care for you, and you should praise Him with heart and soul and voice. You can please Him by manifesting a cheerful spirit. Let not one cloud of despondency or dissatisfaction hide from you the sunshine of His presence.",
