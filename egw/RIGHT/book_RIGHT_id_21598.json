    "word": "Let us take the robe of His righteousness woven in the loom of heaven. There is not a thread of humanity in that robe. It is the robe of Christ's righteousness. Let us put it on right here. We want life. We want to give the example of what Christ is and what we may be. Oh, that we might manifest God to a fallen world. We may be purified so that we may wear the robe of Christ's righteousness, and the crown of immortality. God grant that this may be our lot; for Jesus loves us with a love that is infinite. He does not want that one of us should perish, but that everyone may have that life that measures with the life of God. God grant that we may secure that blessed inheritance--Ms. 12, 1894. (MR 900.11)",
