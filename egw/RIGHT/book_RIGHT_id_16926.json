    "word": "Instruction in the Schools \n\n     The practice of giving instruction on temperance topics in the schools is a move in the right direction. Instruction in this line should be given in every school and every home. The youth and children should understand the effect of alcohol, tobacco, and other like poisons, in breaking down the body, beclouding the mind, and sensualizing the soul. It should be made plain that no one who uses these things can long possess the full strength of his physical, mental, or moral faculties. --\"Education,\" p. 202.",
