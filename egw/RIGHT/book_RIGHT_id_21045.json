    "word": "God calls upon His people to unify, that the harmony among those who love Him and keep His law may convince those in the world that He sent His Son to save sinners. Christ calls upon those who love God and keep His commandments to unify on the truths that have called us out from the world as God's denominated people. God is love, and all who are truly practicing the truth will bear the precious fruit of love. Today Christ is standing at the right hand of God. He will teach every earnest seeker the true science, which is Christ within, the hope of glory.",
