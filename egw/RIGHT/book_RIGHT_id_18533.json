    "word": "Said I, Chapin Harris, when you try with all perseverance and determined will to retrace your steps and recover yourself from Satan's snare, . . . you will escape from your bondage and be a free man. It will require a strong will, in the strength of Jesus, to break up the force of habit, dismiss the adversary of souls that has been entertained by you so long, exchange guests, and welcome Jesus to take possession of the soul temple. But He does not share the heart with Satan. You can, even now, in this late period, make a determined effort, not in your strength but in the strength of Jesus. But Chapin, you have done your mother a great wrong. You have despised her counsel when that counsel was in harmony with the Spirit of God. You have \n\n\n                                    -227- \n\nset aside her judgment when that judgment was wise and right. Self-confident and perverse had been your course to bring her to terms, but she would have displeased God had she shown the least sympathy for your and Mattie's course. . . . You have proved a disobedient son. You have not honored your mother. You have broken the fifth commandment.",
