    "word": "Our object in restaurant work should be the conversion of souls. If we fulfill the purpose of God in this work, the righteousness of Christ must go before us and the glory of the Lord must be our rearward. But if there is no ingathering of souls, if the helpers themselves are not spiritually benefitted, if they are not glorifying God in word and deed, why should we open and maintain such establishments? If we cannot conduct our restaurants to God's glory, if we cannot exert through them a strong religious influence, it would be better for us to close them up, and use the talents of our youth in other lines of work. But I believe that our restaurants can be so conducted that they will be the means of saving souls. Let us seek the Lord earnestly for humility of heart, that He may teach us how to walk in the light of His counsel, how to understand His word, how to accept it, and how to put it into practice. \n\n\n                                    -288-",
