    "word": "The Lord has not been honored or glorified by the past showing of the sanitarium work in Southern California. This work has been greatly hindered because men have relied upon human devising, instead of following the Lord's leading. Dependence has been placed upon human wisdom, \n\n\n                              -80- \n\nand failure has been the result. But we now see a united force of workers anxious to push the enterprise forward along right lines, and we are confident that if they will follow the Lord's instruction and rely upon His guidance, He will cooperate with them.",
