    "word": "Bearing Witness to the Truth \n\n     Our sanitariums are to be established for one object --the proclamation of the truth for this time. And they are to be so conducted that a decided impression in favor of the truth will be made on the minds of those who come to them for treatment. The conduct of each worker is to tell on the side of right. We have a warning message to bear to the world, and our earnestness, our devotion to God's service, are to bear witness to the truth.--Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, p. 200 (1904). \n\n(344)",
