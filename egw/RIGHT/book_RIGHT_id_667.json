    "word": "The existing confusion of conflicting creeds and sects is fitly represented by the term \u201cBabylon,\u201d which prophecy applies to the world-loving churches of the last days. Many seek to make a heaven for themselves by obtaining riches and power. They \u201cspeak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily,\u201d trampling upon human rights and disregarding divine authority. The proud may be for a time in great power, and may see success in all that they undertake, but in the end they will find only disappointment and wretchedness.",
