    "word": "God calls for a consecrated ministry. In Zechariah we read: \"Lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young ones, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that \n\n\n                                   -182- \n\nthat standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall utterly darkened\" [Zechariah 11:16, 17].",
