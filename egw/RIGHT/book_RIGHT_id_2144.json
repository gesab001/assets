    "word": "When we were talking about this land, it was said, \"Nothing can be raised here.\" \"Nevertheless,\" I said, \"the Lord can spread a table in the wilderness.\" Under His direction food will go a long way. When we place ourselves in right relation to Him, He will help us and the food we eat in obedience to Him will satisfy us. We can subsist on very much less than we think we can, if God's blessing is on the food; and if it is for His glory He can multiply it.",
