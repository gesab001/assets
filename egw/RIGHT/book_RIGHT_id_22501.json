The atmosphere in the Review Office is not healthful. The managers are not fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. While they profess to believe the Bible they fail in practicing its teachings. They are hearers but not doers of the Word. The heavenly graces are not in the heart and woven into the character. The requirement is, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.\" Matthew 6:33. The truth as it is in Jesus will lead men to make Christ first and the world second. They will not engage in the sacred work of God without most earnestly seeking heavenly direction, because Christ has said, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" John 15:5.",
