    "word": "Leaders Afraid to Train Others--If in their ministry those whom we teach develop an energy and an intelligence even superior to that which we possess, we should be led to rejoice over the privilege of having a part in the work of training them.  But there is danger that some in positions of responsibility as teachers and leaders, will act as if talent and ability have been given to them only, and that they must do all the work in order to make sure that it is done aright.  They are liable to find fault with everything not originated by themselves.  A great amount of talent is lost to the cause of God because many laborers, desiring to be first, are willing to lead, but never to follow.  Although they closely scrutinize and criticize all that any one else does, they are in danger of regarding that which goes forth from their hands as perfect.--Review and Herald, December 4, 1904.",
