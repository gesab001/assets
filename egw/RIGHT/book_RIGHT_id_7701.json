    "word": "The parable of the wedding garment [Matthew 22:1-14] opens before us a lesson of the highest consequence. . . . By the wedding garment in the parable is represented the pure, spotless character which Christ\u2019s true followers will possess. . . . The fine linen, says the Scripture, \u201cis the righteousness of saints.\u201d It is the righteousness of Christ, His own unblemished character, that through faith is imparted to all who receive Him as their personal Saviour.",
