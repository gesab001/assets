    "word": "Chap. 21 - An Appeal to Prepare the Heart to Receive the Holy Spirit\n\nManuscript 29, 1901\n\n     [A talk given by Ellen G. White on March 28, 1901, at Battle Creek Michigan, to a gathering of publishing leaders. As Mrs. White spoke, her mind turned from this smaller meeting to the General Conference session, which was to begin a few days later, on April 2.] \n\n\n     I feel an intense desire that at this meeting we shall come into right relation with God. We may have great ambition, all the ambition it is possible for us to have; we may have all the activity it is essential for us to have; but unless we are close to our Saviour, unless His power and grace are with us individually, we may be sure that we shall go from this place thinking that we have not had a very wonderful meeting. It rests with us individually to decide what this meeting shall be to us. Since the last time we assembled in General Conference, we have all been making our record, and at this meeting we shall continue to make our record. Every time we assemble together, angels of God are here. Evil angels also are here.",
