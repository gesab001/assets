    "word": "The aim of God's Word is to inspire hope, to lead us to . . . climb step by step heavenward, with ever-increasing vigor. . . .We attain a likeness of character to God by the imparting of His own grace. . . .

We become filled and transfigured by His brightness, as the cloud--dark in itself--when filled with the light is turned to stainless whiteness.",
