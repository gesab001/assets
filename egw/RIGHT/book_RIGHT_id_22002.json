    "word": "And after his apostasy, [CANRIGHT LEFT THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH PERMANENTLY IN FEBRUARY, 1887.] why need you say the things in regard to him you have?

I tell you, brethren, I am troubled when I see you take positions that you forbid others \n                                                                           35\nto take and that you would condemn in others. I do not think this is the right way to deal with one another.",
