    "word": "Children in Their Earliest Years Can Mold Figures of Clay: \n     I was much pleased with my visit to the Orphan's Home. I feel so thankful that the homeless can have so pleasant a home. I have never before seen gathered together so large a number of children, and all bright and cheerful. Their faces are healthy, their eyes clear, their nerves strong. To see them and hear them does me more good than a dose of medicine. The superintendent seems to be well adapted to his position of trust, which he occupies with his wife.",
