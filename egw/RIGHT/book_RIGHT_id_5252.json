    "word": "From every member of the church a steady light should shine forth before the world, so that they shall not be led to inquire, \u201cWhat do these people more than others?\u201d Religion is not to be held as a precious treasure, jealously hoarded, and enjoyed only by the possessor. True religion cannot be thus held; for such a spirit is contrary to the gospel. \u201cFreely ye have received, freely give,\u201d are the words of the Master. While Christ is dwelling in the heart by his Spirit, it is impossible for the light of his presence to be concealed or to grow dim. On the contrary, it will grow brighter and brighter, as day by day the mists of selfishness and sin that envelop the soul are dispelled by the bright beams of the Sun of righteousness.",
