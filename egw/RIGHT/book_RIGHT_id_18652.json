    "word": "[NOTE: JAMES WHITE SUFFERED A STROKE IN AUGUST, 1865. THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS WERE GIVEN LARGELY TO HIS RECOVERY, WITH THE WHITES RESIDING IN 1867 AND 1868 AT GREENVILLE, MICHIGAN, SOME 90 MILES NORTH OF BATTLE CREEK. BY THE TIME OF THE CAMP MEETING AT WRIGHT IN SEPTEMBER, 1868, HE WAS QUITE RECOVERED, BUT ELLEN, WHO HAD THE BURDEN OF HIS CARE, WAS BADLY WORN. AT THE CAMP MEETING THEY WERE URGED TO RETURN TO BATTLE CREEK, WHICH THEY AGREED TO DO. IN MID-OCTOBER THEY MOVED TO BATTLE CREEK, ARRANGED FOR THE BUILDING OF A HOME, AND THEN EMBARKED ON A JOURNEY EAST WHICH TOOK 11 WEEKS. RETURNING TO BATTLE CREEK ON DECEMBER 30 THEY FOUND THEIR HOME FINISHED AND PARTLY FURNISHED WITH THEIR GOODS FROM GREENVILLE. THEY FOUND A VERY UNWHOLESOME SITUATION IN BATTLE CREEK. THEY FACED CRITICISM AND GOSSIP. THIS DEMANDED WEARYING LABOR WITH THE CHURCH. FINALLY IN MID-APRIL, 1869, MUCH WORN, JAMES AND ELLEN WHITE RETURNED TO GREENVILLE HOPEFUL OF FINDING SECLUSION AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE. A FEW DAYS AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL, ELLEN WHITE ADDRESSED A MESSAGE TO \"BRETHREN SMITH AND AMADON.\" THE STATEMENT WHICH FOLLOWS IS DRAWN FROM THIS COMMUNICATION.] \n\n\n                                   -165-",
