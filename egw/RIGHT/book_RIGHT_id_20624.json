    "word": "Has not Christ a right to your service? What relation have you sustained to Him during the years of your life?

You have been bought with a price, and you are living in this world on trial, to be tried as gold is tried in the fire. God will strictly examine you to see what use you have made of His goods. What of your stewardship? Have you faithfully improved the opportunities which have come to you to win souls to Christ? Do you realize that you have not been a faithful steward of your Lord's goods?",
