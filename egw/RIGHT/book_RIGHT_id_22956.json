    "word": "When Dr. Kellogg receives the messages of warning given during the last twenty-years; when he is sincerely converted; when he acts as a consistent, level-headed Christian worker; when his energies are devoted to carrying \n\n\n                                   - 20 - \n\nforward, medical missionary work in right lines; when he bears a testimony that has in it no signs of double meaning or of a misconstruction of the light God has given, then we may have confidence that he is following the light. But until then, we have no right to regard him as a safe leader in the interpretation of the Scripture. He will confuse minds, and will co-mingle specious scientific errors with the instruction that he gives. It is not right to allow this seductive influence to be breathed by men and women who are training to be Christian missionaries; for thus they will be deceived, and led away from the truths that Christ gave to John to give to the churches.",
