    "word": "Some have limited views of the atonement. They think that Christ suffered only a small portion of the penalty of the law of God; they suppose that, while the wrath of God was felt by His dear Son, He had, through all His painful sufferings, the evidence of His Father\u2019s love and acceptance; that the portals of the tomb before Him were illuminated with bright hope, \n209\nand that He had the abiding evidence of His future glory. Here is a great mistake. Christ\u2019s keenest anguish was a sense of His Father\u2019s displeasure. His mental agony because of this was of such intensity that man can have but faint conception of it.",
