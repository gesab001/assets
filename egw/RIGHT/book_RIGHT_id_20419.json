    "word": "Those who have sought unjustly to ruin their fellow men, who have taken man, soul and body, under their control, will have an account to render to God. Some in Battle Creek have sought to guide and control God's human instrumentalities. God says, They are Mine, Mine to work, Mine to impress, Mine to imbue with My Spirit, Mine to use to My name's glory. I give to every human being opportunities to use and improve his abilities and talents, to advance My work, to proclaim My righteousness in the earth. How dare you dictate and seek to control My chosen instrumentalities?",
