T. Jones \n\nDear Brother: \n\n\n     There is a subject which greatly troubles my mind. While I do not see the justice nor right in enforcing by law the bringing the Bible to be read in the public schools: yet there are some things which burden my mind in regard to our people making prominent their ideas on this point. These things I am sure will place us in a wrong light before the world. Cautions were given me on this point. There were some things shown me in reference to the words of Christ, 'Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's,\" placing the matter where the church have no right to enforce anything of a religious character upon the world.",
