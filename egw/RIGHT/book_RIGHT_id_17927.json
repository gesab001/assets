    "word": "Bro. Miller has a very set will. His likes and dislikes are very strong. If he starts on a wrong track, and follows the bent of his mind not moving in wisdom, and his error is presented before him, and he knows he is not right, he will have such a reluctance to acknowledge that he has been in error, and has pursued a wrong course, that he will frame some kind of an excuse to make others believe he is, after all, about right. This is the reason he has been left to follow his own judgment and wisdom, which is foolishness.",
