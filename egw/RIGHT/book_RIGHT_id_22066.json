    "word": "A fair investigation will not fail to reveal wonderful things in God's Word. Every jot of resistance places the opposer in a darker shade. He does not want to see. He will not search God's Word. But opposition and resistance only serve to bring out truth in new, distinct lines. The more truth is spoken against, the brighter it will shine. Thus the precious ore is polished. Every word of slander spoken against it, every misrepresentation of its value, awakens attention and is the means of leading to closer investigation as to what is saving truth. The truth becomes more highly estimated. New beauty and greater value are revealed from every point of view.",
