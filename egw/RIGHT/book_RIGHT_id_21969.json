    "word": "Every man needs now to take his position on the old-true foundation, to be led by God, and not allow Dr. Kellogg's dictated propositions to find favor.

We must work discreetly and determinedly to right up things. This recent effort to present binding propositions to God's people, as if man were God, is the last one he should be permitted to make without our voice being raised in protest. Not another step toward the acceptance of such propositions, is to be taken, lest we be fastened in a snare.",
