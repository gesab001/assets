    "word": "God requires every man to be punctual, just, and without guile in his lips or in his heart. Be righteous in all dealings with your fellow men if you would have not only the name but the character of a Christian. Those who depart from Bible principles, and vindicate their defects as righteous, have never received the true knowledge of Christ or the experience of being in truth doers of the Word. There is nothing in the Word of God that glosses over or excuses one phase of selfishness, one approach to overreaching or dishonesty. . . . \n\n                                               -",
