    "word": "It is time, my dear brother, that you looked at these matters in a right light. You have been called away from the word of God to serve tables. You think, because you are president of the conference, that your duties embrace many things, yea, almost everything. But you neglect things that ought to be done, and take up matters that do not need your personal attention. You think that because you are president you are the only one who is qualified to do certain things. But instead, the fact that you are president is the very reason that you should not do these things. You should hold yourself sacredly aloof from every appearance of evil. You should not make one movement that will give the people cause to speak unfavorably of you.",
