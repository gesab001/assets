    "word": "We are having most excellent meetings. The spirit that was in the meeting in Minneapolis is not here. All moves off in harmony. There is a large attendance of delegates. Our five o'clock morning meeting is well attended, and the meetings good. All the testimonies to which I have listened have been of an elevating character. They say that the past year has been the best of their life; the light shining forth from the Word of God has been clear and distinct,--justification by faith, Christ our righteousness. The experiences have been very interesting.",
