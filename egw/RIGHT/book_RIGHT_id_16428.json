    "word": "Ministerial Institutes. \n\n     \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,\" is Christ's command to his workers. But this plain declaration has been disregarded. Even though the light has been given again and again, men are called from the fields, where they should have continued working in the love and fear of God, seeking to save the lost, to spend weeks in attending a ministerial institute. There was a time when this work was made necessary, because our own people opposed the work of God by refusing the light of truth on the righteousness of Christ by faith. This they should have received and re-echoed with heart and voice and pen; for it is their only efficiency. They should have labored under the Holy Spirit's dictation to give the light to others. \n\n\n                      - 35 -",
