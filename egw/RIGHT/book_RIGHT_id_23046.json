    "word": "It has been most distinctly presented to me that as a people we must walk and work as men and women accountable to God. We must depend upon Him, not on human beings, for, if we depend on human beings, we shall be brought into bondage. The Word of the Living God is to be our guide. Each one is to realize his dependence upon Him whose he is by creation and by redemption. Read and study the statements made in the sixth chapter of John. Pray for an understanding of these truths. I am alarmed as I see the spiritual weakness of those who have had such great light. Had they walked in this light, they would have been strong in the Lord. But they have not, and those who come into the truth through their efforts look to human beings for wisdom, instead of looking to Jesus Christ, \n                                                                           133\n\"the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" When those who claim to believe in Christ receive Him by faith, He will be to them their sanctification, their righteousness, and their exceeding great reward.",
