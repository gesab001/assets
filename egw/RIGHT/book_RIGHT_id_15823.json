    "word": "Right Things--Please read the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah. Great light is given in this chapter. The earnest prayer from the humble, contrite heart will be heard and answered. \"Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.\" This we have a right to expect if we cooperate with God by consecrating ourselves, soul, body, and spirit to His keeping. No foolish talking or evilspeaking will then be heard. The tongue will utter right things.--RH Jan. 25, 1898. \n                                                                           126",
