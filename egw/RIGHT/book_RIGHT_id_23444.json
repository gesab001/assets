    "word": "Chap. 38 - Be Earnest and Steadfast\n\nBy Ellen G. White\n\n     Never was there a time when it is more plainly the duty of the people of God to understand that actions are determined by motives. Those in positions of responsibility are very apt to judge others by themselves. Doing many things that are not in harmony with their profession, they judge others according to their own deviation from righteousness. But as they pronounce judgment upon others, they condemn themselves.",
