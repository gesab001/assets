    "word": "MR No. 1557 - Evangelism in Melbourne Suburbs; God's Law Everlasting; Truth to Triumph Over Error\n\n     (Written February 16, 1894, from St. George's Terrace, St. Kilda Road, Melbourne, to Friends in America.) \n\n\n     I have been wishing that I could write a letter to you and to other friends in America for this mail, but fear that I cannot write much this time. I have had many trying things in my experience since the camp meeting. My soul has been distressed and burdened. Now I feel somewhat relieved; matters are adjusting themselves more pleasantly. We are now in the heat of battle in this country. I feel to the depths of my being that now is the time to work. There are three suburbs where meetings are now in progress--Brighton, Williamstown, and Prahran.",
