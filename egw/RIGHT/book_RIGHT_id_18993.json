    "word": "Wright, Monday, May 2, 1859--We met together again to break bread and wash the saints' feet. It had never been practiced by them, but husband set the example to the men and I to the sisters, then all heartily engaged in it. It was an interesting occasion. The solemnity of the place made it still more profitable. There was weeping and rejoicing, humbling before God altogether. It was a season long to be remembered. Husband never talked more interestingly and appropriately than when breaking the bread, and sobs and groans were heard from the congregation.--Ms 6, 1859, pp. 7, 8. (Diary, April 1 to June 30, 1859.)",
