    "word": "God's people have a great work to do. Seeds must be planted which will produce the right kind of harvest. The world must see in the church of God true order, true discipline, true organization. Paul wrote, \"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for ensample. (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ.)\"",
