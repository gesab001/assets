    "word": "I saw that it was not only those who have property that are in danger and that have a work to do. There are individuals who are not right, who are selfish and are not governed or controlled by the Spirit of God. They have embraced the message, come right along with God's people, without the thorough work of reformation being wrought in them. Their lives are not such as adorn the religion of Jesus and advance the cause of present truth.",
