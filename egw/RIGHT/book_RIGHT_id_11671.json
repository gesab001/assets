    "word": "In the same way today many lose the Saviour from their company. When we do not love to think about Him, or pray to Him; when we speak idle, unkind, or evil words, \n                                                                           34\nwe separate ourselves from Christ. Without Him, we are lonely and sad.  {SJ 33.10}  \n     But if we really desire His company, He will always be with us. With all who seek His presence, the Saviour loves to stay. He will brighten the poorest home, and gladden the lowliest heart.",
