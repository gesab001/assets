    "word": "Brethren and sisters, wake up, wake up! Proclaim the gospel in its simplicity. Listen as for your life to \"what saith the Scriptures.\" It is of supreme importance that you hear aright, that you purify your hearts from selfishness; for your eternal welfare is at stake. Are you seeking for the Pearl of great price? Are you guarding yourselves against the deceptions of Satan, or do you stand ready to receive the suggestions of those who have departed from the faith and given heed to seducing spirits? Your salvation depends on your hearing aright, and receiving with meekness the engrafted word. \n\n\n                                    -234-",
