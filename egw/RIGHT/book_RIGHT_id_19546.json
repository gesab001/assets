    "word": "I think Brother S has made a mistake in having so much to say in exaltation of Professor Bell and Edith Sprague. I cannot harmonize with this. Will Brethren G and S please remember how they have felt and what they have said in reference to my husband calling names, and elevating this one and that one in the public print. Are they doing any wiser? I learn it is much easier to question and condemn than to do better yourselves. All this extolling Brother Bell and Edith Sprague I know is not right. Those who can read human nature and reason upon this matter must see the influence of such pieces in print upon those who have pushed and crowded Brother Bell. It is to make them crowd the harder, to make out a case. The least said on both sides in revealing differences of opinion, the better will it be for themselves, the better for the cause of truth, and in every way better for the ones you would extol.",
