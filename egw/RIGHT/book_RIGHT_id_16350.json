    "word": "Denying of Self. \n\n     Take no glory whatever to yourself. Do not work with a divided mind, trying to serve self and God at the same time. Keep self out of sight. Let your words lead the weary and heavy-laden to carry their burdens to Jesus. Work as seeing him who is at your right hand, ready to give you his efficiency and omnipotent power in any emergency.",
