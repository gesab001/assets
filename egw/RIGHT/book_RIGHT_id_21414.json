    "word": "It has rained steadily all the forenoon. About noon the clouds disappeared and Brother Farnsworth presented Sister Harris and me with his horse and carriage, \n\n\n                                  -9- \n\nto ride out. My head was tired with much writing. We had a very restful drive. It was dark before we returned. The sky was clear and the stars shone brightly. I was much refreshed. We had prayer at the commencement of the Sabbath.--Ms. 42, 1890, p. 4 (Diary 16, pp. 222-223).",
