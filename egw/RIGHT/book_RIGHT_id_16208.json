    "word": "Thank God, He can keep His people in a place where they shall not defile their garments. If we submit to Christ, we shall be kept unspotted from the world. \"Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning\" (Hosea 6:3). We are to follow on. We are not to rest content with the capabilities and the knowledge of today. All the inhabitants of the universe are watching, as in these last days God is preparing a people to stand in the judgment. Let us ask God to clothe us with the robe of Christ's righteousness, that we may be prepared for the coming of the Son of man.",
