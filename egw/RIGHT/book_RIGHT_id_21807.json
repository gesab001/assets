    "word": "God has a great work to do in the world. This work is not yet closed. Who is going to help Him? Satan has come down with great power to oppose the work of God, knowing that he has but a short time. The whole synagogue of Satan opposes the truth. The enemy is trying to counterwork every line of work which God sets in operation. Are we going to act as though there were no enemy to oppose? For Christ's sake put yourselves in right relation to God. Place yourselves physically where you will be able to work. Christ says, \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure\" [Philippians 2:12].",
