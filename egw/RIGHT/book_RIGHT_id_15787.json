    "word": "O Precious, loving, long-suffering, long-forbearing Jesus, how my soul adores Thee! That a poor, unworthy, sin-polluted soul can stand before the Holy God, complete in the righteousness of our Substitute and Surety! Wonder, O Heavens, and be astonished, O earth, that fallen man is the object of His infinite love and delight. He rejoices over them with celestial songs, and man defiled with sin, having become cleansed through the righteousness of Christ, is presented to the Father free from every spot and stain of sin, \"not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing\" (Ephesians 5:27). \"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth\" (Romans 8:33).",
