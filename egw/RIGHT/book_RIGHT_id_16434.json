    "word": "We need not say, \"The perils of the last days are soon to come upon us.\" Already they have come. We need now the sword of the Lord to cut the very soul and marrow of fleshly lusts, appetites, and passions. May it pierce and divide in a far greater degree than it has ever yet done. May all the proud be cast down. May the carnally secure be drawn from the refuge of lies with which they have sought to deceive the people of God. May it cut away their self-righteousness, and open the eyes of the blind that they may see that they are not whole in the sight of God.",
