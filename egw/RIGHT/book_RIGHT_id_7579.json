    "word": "Christ would have our thoughts center upon Him. . . . Look away from self to Jesus Christ, the life of every blessing, every grace, the life of all that is precious and valuable to the children of God. . . . {OFC 49.10} \nThe Lord Jesus is our strength and happiness, the great storehouse from which, on every occasion, men may draw strength. As we study Him, talk of Him, become more and more able to behold Him\u2014as we avail ourselves of His grace and receive the blessings He proffers us, we have \n50\nsomething with which to help others. Filled with gratitude, we communicate to others the blessings that have been freely given us. Thus receiving and imparting, we grow in grace; and a rich current of praise and gratitude constantly flows from our lips; the sweet spirit of Jesus kindles thanksgiving in our hearts, and our souls are uplifted with a sense of security. The unfailing, inexhaustible righteousness of Christ becomes our righteousness by faith. {OFC 49.11} \nLet the fresh blessings of each new day awaken praise in our hearts for these tokens of His loving care.",
