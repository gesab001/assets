    "word": "Nicodemus sought an interview with Jesus at night saying, \"Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.\" All this was true, as far as it went, but what said Jesus? He \"answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Here was a man in high position of trust, a man who was looked up to as one educated in Jewish customs, one whose mind was stored with wisdom. He was indeed in possession of talents of no ordinary character. He would not go to Jesus by day, for this would make him the subject of remark: It would be too humiliating for a ruler of the Jews to acknowledge himself in sympathy with the despised Nazarene. Nicodemus thinks, I will ascertain for myself the mission and claims of this teacher, whether he is in deed the light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Israel. Jesus virtually says to Nicodemus, it is not controversy that will help your case, it is not arguments that will bring light to the soul. You must have a new heart, or you cannot discern the kingdom of heaven. It is not greater evidence that will bring you into a right position, but new purposes, new springs of action; you must be born again. Until this change takes place, making all things new, the strongest evidences that could be presented would be useless. The want is in your own heart; everything must be changed, or you cannot see the kingdom of God.",
