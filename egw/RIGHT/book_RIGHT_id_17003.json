    "word": "Direct theft and outright robbery are not the sins which these men of influence are guilty of committing; but it is the petty dishonesties, the prevarications, the incorrect entries and false statements, which amount to quite a large sum in the course of years. The great evil exists in the heart,--dishonesty of soul. Any deviation from perfect fairness and integrity in business or in trade, little though it may be, is copied by others, only to be increased in magnitude two, three, four, five, or even ten fold. \"He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.\"",
