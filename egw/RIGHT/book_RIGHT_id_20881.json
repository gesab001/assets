    "word": "The Lord Jesus is teaching every soul to step in the sonship of His obedience in humanity, not as a hard duty, but as sons of God, in oneness with the Son in the Father. This obedience in oneness with Christ will make the path of obedience pleasant, for we shall be walking in Christ's footprints. We shall follow where our Saviour leads the way. We may not always see a clear path for our feet, but we can follow in His footsteps, knowing that His example is right. We can leave all the issues with Him. And in this close following, we help others by our example.",
