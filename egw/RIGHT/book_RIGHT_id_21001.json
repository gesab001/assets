    "word": "Remember that your child has rights that should not be ignored. Be very careful never to bring an unjust charge against him. Never punish him without giving him an opportunity to explain. Listen patiently to his troubles and perplexities. Never tell others in his hearing of his clever sayings or doings, or of his faults and misdoings. Even in the presence of the other children this should not be done. Thus you humiliate him without softening him. Hatred springs up in his heart against your course, which he looks upon as cruel and unjust.",
