    "word": "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  {ExV 37.10} \n     Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.  {ExV 37.11} \n     Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breast-plate of righteousness;  {ExV 37.12} \n     And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;  {ExV 37.13} \n     Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  {ExV 37.14} \n     And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.  {ExV 37.15} \n     Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. Ephesians 6:10-18.  {ExV 37.16} \n     And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving \n38\none another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Ephesians 4:32.  {ExV 37.17} \n     Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently. 1 Peter 1:22.",
