    "word": "He whose heart is filled with the love that proceeds from God does not allow self-exaltation or dishonesty to find place in his life. He who is \"born again,\" of the Spirit, reveals Christ in the daily life. He is upright in all his dealings. He does no sly, cunning, underhand work. The good fruit that appears in his life testifies to the condition of his heart. \n                                                                           332",
