    "word": "And there at South Lancaster, the mighty movings of the Spirit of God were there. Some are here that were in that meeting. God revealed His glory; and every student in the college was brought to the door there in confession, and the movings of the Spirit of God were there. And thus from place to place, everywhere we went we saw the movings of the Spirit of God. Do you think, like the ten lepers, I shall keep silent, that I shall not raise my voice to sing the righteousness of God and praise Him and glorify Him?--Ms. 9, 1890, pp. 7, 8.",
