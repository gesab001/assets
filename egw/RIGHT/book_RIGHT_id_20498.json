    "word": "But Satan's connivings with human agencies who stand in responsible positions are just as much to be feared and shunned now after the experiment of sin has been tried, as it was in the case of our first parents. I am instructed to say that the men who are placed in positions of responsibility in the work of God have overestimated their right to control others. The position a man occupies does not change his character. Some have seemed to feel that they must devise for churches and for sanitariums and that there was to be no questioning of their judgment. Let them learn of Jesus at every step. He should be the chief authority for every man.",
