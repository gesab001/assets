    "word": "But did Paul devote his precious time to the relation of his grievous abuses? No, he called the attention from himself to Jesus. He did not live for his own happiness, yet he was happy. . . . \"I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.\" 2 Corinthians 7:4. And in the last days of his life, with a martyr's death in full view, he exclaims with satisfaction, \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.\" 2 Timothy 4:7. And fixing his eye upon the immortal future, which had been the grand, inspiring motive of his whole career, he adds, in full assurance of faith, \"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day\"--and then this man who had lived for others forgets himself--\"and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.\" Oh, noble man of faith!",
