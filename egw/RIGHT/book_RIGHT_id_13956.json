    "word": "Teachers Should Be Exemplary\n\n     The teachers should set a right example before the youth, in spirit, in deportment, and in dress. They should be attired in plain, simple garments; and their spirit should be as humble as a child's, yet pure and elevated, for they stand in the presence of God, to represent the character of Christ to their scholars. In the spirit of devotion, with tenderness of heart, they should look upon their charges, remembering that Jesus said, \u201cTake heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\u201d The angels of God that behold the face of the Father in heaven are looking upon the children and youth, whom you, as living agents for God, are teaching the way of salvation: Think of this, superintendents and teachers; you are in the presence of heavenly angels, doing work the character of which will testify to your fidelity or unfaithfulness to Christ.",
