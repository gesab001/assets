    "word": "I know that Elder Smith and Elder Butler and Morrison and Nicola have been doing a work in their blindness that they will not wish to meet in the judgment. [WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS (1890-1893) ALL FOUR OF THESE MEN MADE CONFESSION OF THEIR WRONG COURSE AND ACCEPTED THE LIGHT ON CHRIST'S RIGHTEOUSNESS PRESENTED AT MINNEAPOLIS. SEE A. V.

The prejudice was swept away from many minds, and I know the Lord gave messages for them and the testimony of the Spirit of God cut its way through everything like prejudice and unbelief. But the brother so intent on his new light did not come to hear me but once.",
