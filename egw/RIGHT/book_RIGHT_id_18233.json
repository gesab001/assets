    "word": "I have trouble with my left eye but I have asked the Lord to heal my eye and the difficulties may be removed from me. He is able to do all things. Satan is the destroyer, and Christ is the Restorer. He has given His word, and I believe that I do receive the things I ask of Him. He has never said, Seek ye My face in vain. This pain in my left eye is a severe trial and test to me. I have been using my right eye to bear the burden largely--to do the seeing for both eyes. I am writing with my left eye bound up. Nevertheless, I cannot see any way but to write. I am praying, \"Lord, increase my faith to perfect trust.\" In every burden the Lord lays upon us there is a blessing for us, if we will only discern it.",
