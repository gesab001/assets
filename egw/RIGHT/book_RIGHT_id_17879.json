    "word": "I saw that those who profess to believe the truth should show their faith by their works. They should, with the unrighteous mammon, make friends, that they may finally be received into everlasting habitations. God has made men stewards of means. He has placed in the hands of stewards, money to carry forward the great work of the salvation of souls for whom Christ left his home, his riches, his glory, and became poor, that he might, by his own humiliation and sacrifice, bring many sons and daughters of Adam to God. God, in his providence, has ordained that the work in his vineyard should be sustained by the means intrusted in the hands of his stewards. A neglect on their part to answer the calls of the cause of God in carrying forward his work, shows them to be unfaithful and slothful servants.",
