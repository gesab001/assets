    "word": "We see there is a great work to be done and we want everyone to be in the right position and do their part of the work. We are laborers together with God. Now, here God expects us to have a living experience as laborers together with God and he wants every (888) one of us to be in working order. We are careless, we are too indifferent; we do not seem to know the plan being worked out. Now I see when I go on the cars, there is one comes thru with a great package of papers. We could read them, but what are they good for? We may find a little news in them, but what we need is the work of life and to have a missionary spirit wherever we are. The world will never be warned if we take it so easy. We know how it was with the schools of the prophets. We know that they were learning out of the scriptures and that they were praising God; because they understood the Scriptures, God was glorified. And as Saul was searching for David he came right up to the school of the Prophets and behold the first thing they knew he was prophesying right with the prophets. The school of the prophets was a special school to get the endowment of the Holy Spirit of God and then go forth into the dark places of the earth and seek for those who would listen to the testimony that they had to bring.",
