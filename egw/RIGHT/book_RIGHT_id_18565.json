    "word": "Let nothing draw you from the work. Men and women may unite with the Prince of heaven in turning souls from unrighteousness to righteousness. The people must have the saving truth for this time. Entreat the men who have means to return to the Lord the treasures He has lent them in trust, that in New York there may be established a center from which Bible truth in its simplicity can be given to the people. Many all through the city are praying for light. They want to understand what is truth. Men who have money will reveal a living faith in the word of God and will return to the Lord the means He has lent them in trust that light may shine amid the darkness of sin and error.--Letter 141, 1901, pp. 3-5. (To Brother and Sister S. N. Haskell, September 16, 1901.)",
