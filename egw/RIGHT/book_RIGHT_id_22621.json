    "word": "Thursday, April 13, we left Napier for Palmerston. It was six hours ride in the cars. There are a few Sabbath keepers in Palmerston. Four years ago there was an effort made by Elder Robert Hare in Palmerston, and the people turned out in a wonderful manner to hear. If right plans had been made there might have been many souls brought to the truth. Brother Hare was not working in the right lines, his main purpose was to get the largest kind of a congregation by fanciful preaching, which differed vastly from the preaching of John the fore runner of Christ. Many signed the covenant, but when he left it was demonstrated that they believed in Robert Hare, were attracted to the man and not to Jesus Christ. Many who signed the covenant were unconverted, and when left alone they withdrew their names. But in the last four years the population has double and another effort must be made and a meeting house built. This is a necessity in most places in this country.",
