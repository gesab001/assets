    "word": "Sister, work on in faith. Jesus loves you, and He would have you trustful, strong in His love, and you can be a blessing in many ways, at the right and left. Whatever you shall see inconsistent in practical godliness in those who claim to be children of God, be not discouraged at all. Stand, looking unto Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of your faith. The Holy One has given us rules for the guidance of all. These rules form the standard from which there can be no sinless swerving. By the combined influence of authority and affection we are to keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment. We need not be weak and inefficient. In order to represent Christ we must be strong in His strength, pure as He is pure; truth as it is in Jesus is planted in the heart.",
