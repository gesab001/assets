    "word": "MR No. 289 - Sanctification\n\n     We must have the right kind of faith, combined with good works. If we have saving faith, we shall indeed see of the salvation of God. Let none of us have a superficial faith which means nothing. Do not say, \"This one was prayed for, and saved.\" This is misleading. This is not that saving faith which works by love and purifies the soul. Every soul will be tested and proved, and if in the proving any man draws back, he will fail to meet the standard of God. \"The just shall live by faith.\" They will show their faith by their works. \"If any man draw back,\" God says, \"my soul shall have no pleasure in him.\" . . .",
