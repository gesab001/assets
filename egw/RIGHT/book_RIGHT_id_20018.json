    "word": "Keep looking to Jesus. He desires to reflect His image through you. The whole heart's purpose must be constantly refined, elevated, ennobled, sanctified, else you will mar the work of God, and ruin your own soul. The truth, my brother, must be more clearly stamped upon your heart. \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\" [Romans 10:10]. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength\" [Mark 12:30]. This takes all there is of the man.",
