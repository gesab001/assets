    "word": "If those youth who have opportunity to gain an education will put the Word of God first, seeking to obtain that wisdom which comes as a sacred fire from heaven, they will learn lessons highly essential for them to know. As students enter upon their school life, they are in danger of receiving from other students impressions that will endanger their principles of right, and they need to fasten their hold more firmly upon God, relying by faith upon His promises, and inquiring at every step, How can I best acquire a knowledge of God? How shall I shun the road leading to destruction, for I cannot take one false step without leading others by my precept and example.",
