    "word": "Spirit of God Needed--Now brethren I want to tell you when the Spirit of God comes into our midst it will strike the minds that are ready to receive it. But if their minds are not open to receive it, they are all ready to pass judgment upon the messenger and the words spoken, and in the place of coming to God and asking Him to give them a new heart and a new mind, and that the transforming influence of the grace of God shall be upon them, they commence to find fault and pick flaws. It does not strike them. It must harmonize with their ideas. They will stand right there until these things are culled out of the way, and they place themselves right there to judge. This is the way it was at Minneapolis.--Ms. 2, 1889, p. 2.",
