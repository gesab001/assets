    "word": "The Sanitarium. I need not speak any more on this point. I wish to speak now in reference to the sanitarium in Battle Creek. Our brethren say: \"Sister White has confused us. She said that we must not let this sanitarium go into the hands of worldlings. And she said also that we must try to place the sanitarium upon a right foundation.\" Yes, this I did say. Now I repeat it. For years light has been coming to me that we should not center so much \n\n\n                                    -82- \n\nin one place. I have stated distinctly that an effort should not be made to make Battle Creek the sign and symbol of so much. The Lord is not very well pleased with Battle Creek. Not all that has been done in Battle Creek is well pleasing to Him. And when the sanitarium there was burned, our people should have studied the messages of reproof and warning sent them in former years, and taken heed. . . .",
