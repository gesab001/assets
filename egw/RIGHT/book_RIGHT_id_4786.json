    "word": "Satan's work of ruin is forever ended. For six thousand years he has wrought his will, filling the earth with woe, and causing grief throughout the universe. The whole creation has groaned and travailed together in pain. Now God's creatures are forever delivered from his presence and temptations. \u201cThe whole earth is at rest, and is quiet; they [the righteous] break forth into singing.\u201d [Isaiah 14:7.] And a shout of praise and triumph ascends from the whole loyal universe. \u201cThe voice of a great multitude,\u201d \u201cas the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings,\u201d is heard, saying, \u201cAlleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.\u201d",
