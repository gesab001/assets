    "word": "Let those who claim to be the sons and daughters of God meet together to bring hope to one another's hearts. We keep apart from God and from one another, but the scripture declares that \u201cthey that feared the Lord spake often one to another.\u201d [Malachi 3:16.] Coldness, formality, and indifference are quenching the vital spark of piety. Wherever we go we should carry an atmosphere of Christian hopefulness and cheer; then those who are out of Christ will see some attractiveness in the religion we profess. We need to get more distinct glimpses of heaven, the land where all is brightness and joy. We need to know more of the fullness of the blessed hope.",
