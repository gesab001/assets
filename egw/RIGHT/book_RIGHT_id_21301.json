    "word": "There are many men in our world who are like Cornelius. They are not fully informed in regard to the truth for this time; and yet, as did Cornelius, they fear God and follow principles of righteousness. In every sphere of action they work on the principles that God accepts. All through the ages there have been devout men whose lives were an example that others might well follow. They have borne a clear, pure, undefiled testimony for truth and righteousness. In their high position of responsibility, even among accomplished worldly men, they were bright and shining lights. Not all men forget God in their investigation of true science.",
