    "word": "It has been said, We want Sister White to attend the conference, and we want the conference held in Battle Creek. But I dare not go. Not that I would [not] like to go, but I dare not, because mid-winter is not the proper time to hold a conference. Those who attend are obliged to sit in rooms heated by steam or stoves. Then perhaps, after sitting in these hot rooms, they sleep in cold rooms, and shiver all night, as I have done again and again, and it has nearly cost me my life. This heating of rooms so highly is an evil. It would be better for us to put on more clothes and \n\n\n               -144- \n\nhave less heated air. If those who attend our meetings would do this, they would be in a more favorable condition to make right decisions.",
