    "word": "I have words of encouragement for you. Jesus loves you. He gave His precious life that you should not perish, but have everlasting life. Then lift your eyes to Him. Look on the bright side. It will do you no good to look on the dark side. Be patient, come what will. You may gather strength from Jesus, for in Him all fulness dwells. When despair would sweep over your soul, continue to look to Jesus. Cast your helpless soul upon Him. He ever liveth to make intercession for you. You are precious in His sight. He who looks with interest upon the little brown sparrow looks in love and pity upon His tried, afflicted child.",
