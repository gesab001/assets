    "word": "Through the perversion of appetites and passions, man has lost the power of God and become the instrument of unrighteousness. The whole being is diseased--body, soul, and spirit. But a remedy has been provided for the sanctification of humanity. The unholy mind and body may be purified. A wonderful provision has been made whereby we may receive pardon and salvation.--Lt 139, 1898.",
