When the wrath of God was greatly kindled against Israel for their unbelief, their murmurings, and their grievous sins, Moses love for them was tested. God promised him that if he would let Israel go, let them be destroyed, he would make of him a mighty nation. Moses showed his love for Israel by his earnest pleading. In his distress he prayed God to turn from his fierce anger, and forgive Israel, or blot his name out of his book.",
