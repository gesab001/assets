    "word": "We saw the great need for a school in which promising young men and young women could be trained for the Master's service; and we went right into the woods in New South Wales, purchased 1500 acres of land, and there established a training school away from the cities. The nearest city, Newcastle, was 25 miles distant; and Sydney, where we purchased most of our supplies, was about 75 miles south.
