    "word": "All Ye are Brethren \n\n     No one man is ever to set himself up as a ruler, as a lord over his fellowmen, to act out his natural impulses. No one man's voice and influence should ever be allowed to become a controlling power. Those who oppress their fellow workers in our institutions, and who refuse to change their manner of treating helpers under their charge, should be removed. As overseers, they should have exerted a superior, refining influence for the right. Their investment with power makes it all the more necessary for them to be models of true Christianity.",
