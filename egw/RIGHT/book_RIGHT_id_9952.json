    "word": "The 144,000 Without Guile.--One of the marked features in the representation of the 144,000 is that in their mouth there was found no guile. The Lord has said, \"Blessed is the man . . . in whose spirit there is no guile.\" They profess to be children of God, and are represented as following the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. They are prefigured before us as standing on Mount Zion, girt for holy service, clothed in white linen, which is the righteousness of the saints. But all who follow the Lamb in heaven will first have followed Him on earth, in trustful, loving, willing obedience, followed Him not fretfully and capriciously, but  confidently, truthfully, as the flock follows the shepherd. . . .",
