    "word": "We desire above all else to represent the truth as it is in Jesus. We cannot afford to represent that which is false. Into every department of our work, we are to carry the principles of righteousness. The Lord desires to do great things for His people, but if we do nothing, and think that everything will work out as it should, we shall certainly be disappointed. If we will unite with Christ, He will co-operate with us in all our efforts to serve Him.",
