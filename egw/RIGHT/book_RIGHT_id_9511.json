    "word": "With the confession of the repenting, believing sinner, Christ mingles His own righteousness, that the prayer of fallen man may go up as fragrant incense before the Father, and the grace of God be imparted to the believing soul. Jesus says to the trembling, repenting soul: \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me\" (Isaiah 27:5). \"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be \n                                                                           330\nred like crimson, they shall be as wool\" (Isaiah 1:18). Will you let Him reason with you? Will you commit to Him the keeping of your soul as unto a faithful Creator? Come then, and let us live in the light of His countenance, and pray, as did David, \"Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow\" (Psalm 51:7). By faith apply the blood of Christ to your heart, for that alone can make you whiter than snow. But you say, \"This surrender of all my idols will break my heart.\" This giving up of all for God is represented by your falling upon the Rock and being broken. Then give up all for Him; for unless you are broken, you are worthless.",
