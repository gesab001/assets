    "word": "Believe me when I tell you that it is your privilege and duty to possess your soul in patience under insult and provocation. You can do this only through Christ Jesus. Why? He is your staff, your wisdom, your sanctification, and your righteousness. Your character cannot be divided into parts, one made of great and noble things and regulated by the law of God; and the other made of little things and subjected to nervous irritations, to variations, and caprices of natural traits of character that obtain the ascendancy. Such a course would \n\n\n                                     -95- \n\ncut off a large part of your service for the Master. The want of self-control, a calm spirit, robs God of His proper right to reveal His perfection of character in you, and produces new difficulties for you. However anyone may deserve chastisement, withhold your words, for that which you reflect upon others will in a ten-fold degree be reflected upon you.",
