    "word": "We have need to be alarmed because selfishness and covetousness are becoming a ruling power among us, and the Lord is displeased. The consciences of many are like India rubber. Men can be bought and sold by the highest bidder. When such men are weighed in the balances of the sanctuary, they are found wanting, for conscientiousness, honor, integrity, and fidelity are lacking. The sin of bribery is becoming so common, that the moral senses of many are perverted by this unholy practice. The time of testing is upon us, and many hold the truth in unrighteousness. They do not place themselves where they can best glorify God, but best please and glorify themselves. When it serves their purpose they are the most zealous advocates of the truth; but when the test of trial comes upon them, they shrink under the measuring line of God. Malachi describes the process of trial that shall fit the people of God to abide the day of His coming. \"But who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: And He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness\" (Malachi 3:2, 3). This is the work the Lord will do throughout our institutions. And let no \n                                                                           201\nman or woman stand in the way of this important work; for souls are imperilled, and must be cleansed, refined, and purified as silver in the furnace.",
