    "word": "The East. \n\n     The Lord has not tested his people upon any particular time since 1844. We have been, and still are, in the patient waiting time.

But such conclusions are not necessary. There was much preached in connection with the time in 1854, that was reasonable and right. Some who were honest, took truth and error, all together, and sacrificed much of what they possessed to carry out that error, and after their disappointment they gave up both truth and error, and are now where it is very difficult for the truth to reach them.",
