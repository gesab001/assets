    "word": "Sister White.--In my younger days, I used to talk too loud. The Lord has shown me that I could not make the proper impression upon the people by getting the voice to an unnatural pitch. Then Christ was presented before me, and his manner of talking; and there was a sweet melody in his voice. His voice, in slow, calm manner, reached those who listened, his words penetrated their hearts, and they were able to comprehend what he said before the next sentence was spoken. Some seem to think they must race right straight along, or else they will lose the inspiration, and the people will lose the inspiration. If that is inspiration, let them lose it, and the sooner the better.",
