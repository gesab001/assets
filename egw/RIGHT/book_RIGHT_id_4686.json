    "word": "Those who in the Judgment are \u201caccounted worthy,\u201d will have a part in the resurrection of the just. Jesus said, \u201cThey which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, . . . are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.\u201d [Luke 20:35, 36.] And again he declares that \u201cthey that have done good\u201d shall come forth \u201cunto the resurrection of life.\u201d [John 5:29.] The righteous dead will not be raised until after the Judgment at which they are accounted worthy of \u201cthe resurrection of life.\u201d Hence they will not be present in person at the tribunal when their records are examined, and their cases decided.",
