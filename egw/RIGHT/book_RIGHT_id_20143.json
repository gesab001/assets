    "word": "In the development of character, you do not show that you have cultivated a firm persevering, uniform, unyielding energy and faith. If you can preach upon subjects that are familiar to you, and which are your favorite subjects, you are at home, but get you off this marked line and you have but little force and but little courage, and you are not the man of opportunity fitted for any emergency. You need a deeper draught of salvation. Trust less in D. M. Canright, and more in the power of God's grace.",
