    "word": "Amusing Stories--My brother, you need to examine more closely the discourses you present to the people. The object of your ministerial labors is not to amuse. It is not to convey information alone, not merely to convince the intellect. The preaching of the Word should appeal to the intellect and impart knowledge, but it comprises much more than this. The heart of the minister must reach the hearts of the hearers. Some have adopted a style of preaching that does not have a right influence. It has become a habit with them to cheapen their discourses by the relation of anecdotes. The impression thus made upon the hearers is not a savor of life unto life. You should not bring amusing stories into your preaching. The people need pure provender, thoroughly winnowed from all that is not food. \n                                                                           275\n\"Preach the Word,\" was the charge that Paul gave to Timothy, and this is your commission.--Lt 61, 1896.",
