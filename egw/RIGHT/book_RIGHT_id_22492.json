    "word": "There is altogether too much self-confidence and self-sufficiency, altogether too much pride of heart and self-esteem, without giving glory to God. God has given minds and talents to men only in trust, on trial, to test and prove them to see if they will work in His way and do His will, and put not confidence in themselves alone. If they do not stand the test, they are false to His kingdom. \"Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.\" Jeremiah 9:23, 24.",
