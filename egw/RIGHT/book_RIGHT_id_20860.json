    "word": "MR No. 1427 - Reflections While Crossing the Pacific\n\n     (Diary written on the way from Australia to California, 1900.) \n\n     Steamer Moana, Aug. 29, 1900. We are on our way to America, after an absence of nine years. As we left the Sanitarium at Wahroonga, to take passage on the Moana, I felt very much affected. I am troubled in regard to the future of the work. For so many years my interest has been bound up with this work that to separate from it seems like tearing me in pieces. I have confidence in those left in charge of the work at Avondale. If they will trust implicitly in God, the Sun of righteousness will go before them, and the glory of God will be their rearward.",
