    "word": "Chap. 45 - The Fruitless Fig Tree\n\nManuscript 65,1912\n\n     The Jewish nation that had been so proud and had made such boastful pretensions was symbolized by the pretentious fig tree. This nation had proudly claimed to possess the goodness and virtue which she might have had but which she did not have any right to claim because she had forfeited the promises of God. These promises He has plainly connected with willing obedience, and He can fulfill them only when His people hearken to His commandments and walk in the way of His appointment.",
