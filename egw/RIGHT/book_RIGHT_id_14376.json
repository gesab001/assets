    "word": "7 T.--128-129 \n     The Lord has instructed me to say that He has not confined to a few persons all the light there is to be received in regard to the best preparations of health foods. He will give to many minds in different places tact and skill that will enable them to prepare health foods suitable for the countries in which they live.  {TSDF 23.10}  \n     God is the author of all wisdom, all intelligence, all talent. He will magnify His name by giving to many minds the wisdom in the preparation of health foods. And when He does this, the making of these new foods is not to be looked upon as an infringement of the rights of those who are already manufacturing health foods, although in some respects the foods made by the different ones may be similar. God will take ordinary men and will give them skill and understanding in the use of the fruit of the earth. He deals impartially with His workers. Not one is forgotten by Him. He will impress business men who are Sabbath-keepers to establish industries that will provide employment for His people. He will teach His servants to prepare less expensive health foods, which can be bought by the poor.  {TSDF 23.11}  \n     In all our plans we should remember that the health food work is the property of God, and that it is not to be made a financial speculation for personal gain. It is God's gift to His people, and the profits are to be used for the good of suffering humanity everywhere.  {TSDF 23.12}  \n     Especially in the Southern States of North America, many things will be devised and many facilities provided, that the poor and needy can sustain themselves by the health-food industries. Under teachers \n\n24 \n\nwho are laboring for the salvation of their souls, they will be taught how to cultivate and prepare for food those things that grow most readily in their locality.  {TSDF 23.13}  \n                                                        7 T.--134 \n     The foods used should be suited to the occupation in which we are engaged and the climate in which we live. Some foods that are suitable in one country will not do in another.",
