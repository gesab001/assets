    "word": "Neglect of your apparel has been a decidedly objectionable feature of your character.  The impression you have made upon the minds both of believers and of unbelievers has not met the mind of the Spirit of God. Because of your slackness in this matter, our people have not felt free to advise you to take up work in selling literature, a work in which you might have accomplished much good.  There is a useful work in which you might engage, visiting from house to house and speaking the right words, but your untidy influence works counter to the precious influence you might otherwise exert.",
