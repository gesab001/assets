    "word": "You who are resting your hope on self are building on the sand. But it is not yet too late to escape the impending ruin. Before the tempest breaks, flee to the sure foundation. \"Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, of sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.\" \"Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.\" \"Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of My righteousness.\" \"Ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.\" Isaiah 28:16, R.V.; 45:22; 41:10; 45:17.",
