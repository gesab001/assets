White and wife\n\n                                        W. - 121 - 1904 \n\n                           \"Elmshaven,\" Sanitarium, Cal., \n\n\n                                          March 29, 1904. \n\nMy dear Edson and Emma,--- \n     I returned from Healdsburg yesterday, and was in the train nearly all day. We did not dare to drive over; for there has been so much rain that the road from here to Healdsburg is almost impassable. There has been no travel over the direct road for the past two weeks. All through the month of March we have had continuous rain, with the exception of one or two bright days.",
