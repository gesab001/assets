    "word": "It is only through faith in Christ that sinners may have the righteousness of Christ imputed unto them, and that they may be \"made the righteousness of God in him.\" Our sins were laid on Christ, punished in Christ, put away by Christ, in order that his righteousness might be imputed to us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Although sin was charged to His account on our behalf, yet He remained perfectly sinless.--The Signs of the Times, May 30, 1895.",
