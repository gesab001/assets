    "word": "To know one's self is great knowledge. The teacher who rightly estimates himself will let God mold him and discipline his mind. And he will acknowledge the source of his power. For \"what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?\" 1 Corinthians 4:7. Self-knowledge leads to humility and trust in God; but it does not take the place of efforts for self-improvement. He who realizes his own deficiencies should spare no pains to reach the highest possible standard of physical, mental, and moral excellence. No one should have a part in the training of youth, who will be satisfied with a lower standard.",
