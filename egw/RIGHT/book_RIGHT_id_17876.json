    "word": "I was shown that Bro. Waggoner is a strong man upon some points, while upon other points he is as weak as a child. His course in dealing with the erring has had a scattering influence. Bro. Waggoner has confidence in his ability to labor in setting things in order where he thinks it is needed, but he does not view the matter aright. He weaves into his labors his own spirit, and he does not discriminate, but often deals without tenderness. There is such a thing as over-doing the matter in doing strict duty to individuals. \"And of some have compassion, making a difference; and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.\"",
