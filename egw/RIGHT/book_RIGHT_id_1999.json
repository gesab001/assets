    "word": "A Harmful Combination [TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH, VOL. 2, PP. 368-370 (1869).] \n\n\n     In regard to milk and sugar: I know of persons who have become frightened at the health reform and said they would have nothing to do with it, because it has spoken against a free use of these things. Changes should be made with great care, and we should move cautiously and wisely. We want to take that course which will recommend itself to the intelligent men and women of the land. Large quantities of milk and sugar eaten together are injurious. They impart impurities to the system. . . . Sugar clogs the system. It hinders the working of the living machine.",
