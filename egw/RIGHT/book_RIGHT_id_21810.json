    "word": "That Comforter is with us today. Letters come to me in which the writers ask me to pray for them. But Christ is praying for them. All they need is to carry their soul-distress to Jesus. He says, \"I am at thy right hand to help thee.\" This is what I try to write to them. I tell them not to go to any human being for the help that Christ alone can give. He says, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. \n\n\n               -149- \n\nFor My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\"",
