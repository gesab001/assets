    "word": "God's forgiveness is not merely a judicial act by which He sets us free from condemnation. It is not only forgiveness for sin but reclaiming from sin. It is the outflow of redeeming love that transforms the heart. David had the true conception of forgiveness when he prayed, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\" Psalm 51:10.",
