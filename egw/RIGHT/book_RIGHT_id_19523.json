    "word": "[Ephesians 2:1-10; 6:10-13, quoted.] \n     God is represented as weighing the characters, actions, and motives of men. Christ said to Nicodemus, \"Ye must be born again\" (John 3:7). He is speaking the same words to those who know not the spirit that moves them to action. Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Hannah, the mother of Samuel, said, \"The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed\" (1 Samuel 2:3). David says, \"Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity\" (Psalm 62:9). Isaiah declares, \"Thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just\" (Isaiah 26:7). And Solomon writes, \"All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits\" (Proverbs 16:2).",
