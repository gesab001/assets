    "word": "God gave the Israelites special directions concerning the arrangement of their camp, that all might be in perfect order. And everything connected with the tabernacle was designed to impress the people with the majesty and holiness of God, and the purity he requires of all who engage in his service. These arrangements were not merely for the benefit of Israel. God designed that the order and harmony, the exalted character of the Jewish economy, should make an impression upon surrounding nations, revealing to them something of the character of the true God, and what he desires his people to be. The same principles apply to the work at this time. Remember that with the world everything is judged by appearances. Study carefully the word of God, the instructions given to ancient Israel, and let all your arrangements be such as rightly to represent Him in whose cause you labor.\u2014MS.
