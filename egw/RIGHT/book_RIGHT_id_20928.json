    "word": "True Christians will have an experience like that of Christ in the wilderness of temptation, especially those who engage in rescuing souls from the snares of Satan. They will meet the assaults of the enemy of all righteousness; and as Christ overcame, so may they overcome through His grace. No one should feel that he is abandoned of God because he is subjected to sore temptations. If he remains unshaken by the temptations, Satan will leave him, and angels will minister to him as they did to Jesus. There is no comfort equal to that which Christians enjoy when the tempted soul has patiently suffered and Satan has been vanquished. They have borne witness for Jesus, relying wholly upon the word of God, \"It is written,\" and thus have resisted every advance of Satan, till they have beaten him back and gained the victory.",
