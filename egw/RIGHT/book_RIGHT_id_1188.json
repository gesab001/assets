    "word": "FALSE PROPHETS DO NOT EXALT CHRIST. THEY RATHER DRAW ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES. \"SPEAKING PERVERSE THINGS,\" THEY \"DRAW AWAY DISCIPLES\" AFTER THEMSELVES. ACTS 20:30. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THEY TEACH IN A MANNER TO PLEASE THE CARNAL MIND OF THOSE WHO IN THEIR HEARTS \"SAY TO THE SEERS, SEE NOT; AND TO THE PROPHETS, PROPHESY NOT UNTO US RIGHT THINGS, SPEAK UNTO US SMOOTH THINGS.\" ISAIAH 30:10. THESE ALLEGED PROPHETS OR TEACHERS ARE \"OF THE WORLD: THEREFORE SPEAK THEY OF THE WORLD, AND THE WORLD HEARETH THEM.\" 1 JOHN 4:5.",
