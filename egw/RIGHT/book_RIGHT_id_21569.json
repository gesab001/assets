    "word": "I want to tell you that you have every reason to rejoice today. Christ says, \"Come, come unto Me, and I will give you rest.\" What have we to rejoice in? That Christ is not in Joseph's new tomb, and a great stone rolled before it. Where is He? Where is Jesus? He has arisen; He has risen from the dead; \n\n\n                                     -202- \n\nHe has ascended on high. He is our Advocate, and He pleads in our behalf before the Father. We have a Friend at court. Thank God, we have a Friend at court! Then offer up your petitions. The righteousness of Christ is there. The perfection of Christ is there.",
