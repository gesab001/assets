    "word": "Just keep praising God, and when the devil tempts you, sing. When Christ was a child He was tempted in every way, and what did He do? He sang psalms, and praised God, and there was music in His voice. And there was an impression made upon the hearts and minds of those who heard Him. He wants you to have heaven in view, and heaven is a good deal nearer than you think. God's holy, anointed ones are right by you, and here is His church, the greatest object of His love that it is possible for Him to have. He is watching over every one of us.",
