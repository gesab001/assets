    "word": "My brethren in responsible places, mourn not over the work that is being done in the highways and hedges in the South. God has specified that this work should be done. Those who have tried to block the way have not been led by the Spirit of God. Cease your criticisms of God's servants, and humble your own hearts before the Lord, that He may show you the right way. Let this company alone to continue their work, and go thou and encourage others to do a similar work. Then the light of truth will be carried in a simple but effective way, and a great work will be accomplished for the Master.",
