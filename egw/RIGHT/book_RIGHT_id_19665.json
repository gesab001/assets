    "word": "The lesson of Christ in the parable of the Pharisee and the publican is recorded for the benefit of all who believe the words of Christ. It was spoken to some who the great Teacher saw were self-conceited, full of their own righteousness, and who despised others. \"Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted\" [Matthew 23:12]. Your position is that of exalting self. Your assumption of excellency that does not belong to you will certainly exclude you from the grace which, can truly exalt. True righteousness never produces such fruit; false righteousness always does.",
