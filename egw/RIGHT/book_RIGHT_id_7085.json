    "word": "Private Counseling Can Become a Snare (counsel to a minister).--Last night your case was forced to my notice, and I was talking with you as a mother talks with \n\n\n                                                 767 \n\nher son. I said, \"Brother _____, you should not feel it to be your duty to converse with young ladies upon certain subjects, even if your wife is present. You are encouraging in them the idea that it is all right to communicate to ministers the family secrets and difficulties that should be brought before God, who understands the heart, who never makes a mistake, and who judges righteously. Refuse to listen to any communications of private matters, concerning either families or individuals. If persons are encouraged to come to one man with their troubles, they will think it all right to keep up this practice, and it will become a snare, not only to the soul who communicates, but to the one to whom these things are confided.\"--Lt 7, 1889.",
