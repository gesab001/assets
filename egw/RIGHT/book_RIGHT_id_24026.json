    "word": "Elder Daniells is a man who has proved the testimonies to be true. And he has proved true to the Testimonies. When he has found that he has differed from them, he has been willing to acknowledge his errors, and come to the light. If all others had done the same, there would be no such state of things as now exists. The Lord has given Elder Daniells reproof when he has erred, and he has shown his determination to stand on the side of truth and righteousness, and to correct his mistakes.",
