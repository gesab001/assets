    "word": "\"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul\" (Psalm 19:7). Without the law, men have no just conception of the purity and holiness of God or of their own guilt and uncleanness. They have no true conviction of sin and feel no need of repentance. Not seeing their lost condition as violators of God's law, they do not realize their need of the atoning blood of Christ. The hope of salvation is accepted without a radical change of heart or reformation of life. Thus superficial conversions abound, and multitudes are joined to the church who have never been united to Christ.... By the Word and the Spirit of God are opened to men the great principles of righteousness embodied in His law.--The Great Controversy, pp. 467-469.",
