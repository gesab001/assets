    "word": "Christ is drawing every one that is not past the boundary. He is drawing him to Him today, no matter how great that sinner is, He is drawing him. And if the sinner can get his arm fixed upon the cross of Calvary, then there is \n\n\n                                   -33- \n\nno conviction of sin.

And then he begins to look to the righteousness of Christ as the only thing that can cleanse the sinner from his sins and from his transgressions.",
