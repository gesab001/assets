    "word": "Many believe themselves to be on the right foundation, that they have the truth, and rejoice in the clearness of truth, and boast of the powerful arguments in proof of the correctness of our position, and reckon themselves among the chosen, peculiar people of God, yet they experience not the presence and power of God to save them from yielding to temptation and folly.

The love of the world with many, the deceitfulness of riches with a few, has choked the word, and they have become unfruitful.",
