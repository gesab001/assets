    "word": "When an effort is made to correct these practices, it is generally received as an evidence of stinginess on the part of the managers; and some will make no change, but go on hardening the conscience, until it becomes seared as with a hot iron. They rise up against any restriction, and act and talk defiantly, as though their rights had been invaded. But God looks upon all these things as theft, and so the record is carried up to Heaven. All fraud and deceit is forbidden in the word of God. Direct theft and outright falsehood are not sins into which persons of respectability are in danger of falling. It is transgression in the little things that first leads the soul away from God. By their one sin in partaking of the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve opened the flood-gates of woe upon the world. Some may regard that transgression as a very little thing; but \n                                                                           62\nwe see that its consequences were anything but small. The angels in Heaven have a wider and more elevated sphere of action than we; but right with them and right with us are one and the same thing.",
