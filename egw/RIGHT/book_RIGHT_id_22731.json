    "word": "When Belshazzar's period of probation closed, the Lord no longer protected him from the sure result of his own course of action. If a man puts his hand into the fire, it will be burned: the Lord does not work a miracle to save him. To reason as many will, that God ought to have prevented certain men from doing certain things, is fallacious reasoning. God sends warnings, entreaties, and reproofs, to correct that which is wrong, to justify that which is righteous: God could in a most marked manner have prevented men from doing as they have done in your council meetings; for he can destroy and make alive. \n                                                                           1397\nBut he leaves men free to choose their own course of action. A man may throw himself over a precipice or into the dark waters of the sea, and God does not work a miracle to prevent it. God did not draw back the arm of Adam, and by physical restraint make it impossible for him to take the forbidden fruit. The Lord says, Thou shalt not do this wrong: if man chooses to give his will to Satan to do that wrong, the sin and its result lie at his own door.",
