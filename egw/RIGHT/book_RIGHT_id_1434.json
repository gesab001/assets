    "word": "Exercise Faith of Caleb.--It was Caleb's faith in God that gave him courage; that kept him from the fear of man, even the mighty giants, the sons of Anak, and enabled him to stand boldly and unflinchingly in defense of the right. From the same exalted source, the mighty General of the armies of heaven, every true soldier of the cross of Christ must receive strength and courage to overcome obstacles that often seem insurmountable.... \n                                                                           118\nWe want Calebs now . . . who with courageous words will make a strong report in favor of immediate action. --Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 378-383.
