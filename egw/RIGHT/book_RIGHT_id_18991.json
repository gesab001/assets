    "word": "Wright, Michigan, Sabbath, April 30, 1859--Attended meeting today. About 200 present. It was a good meeting. Husband preached upon the law of God in connection with baptism. A Mr. Palmer arose to ask a question which appeared to be merely to bring himself into notoriety and throw confusion, but no notice was taken of him. The meeting progressed. I exhorted a little, then others followed with their sweet testimonies.",
