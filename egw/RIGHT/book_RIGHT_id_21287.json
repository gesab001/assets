    "word": "The clouds of uncertainty and unbelief were rolled back as the Saviour cried with a loud voice, \"It is finished.\" No longer had the enemy any power to tempt and annoy Him. Holiness and justice united in the completion of the great work of redemption. On the cross mercy and truth met together, righteousness and peace kissed each other. Jesus had testified that God is true. Faith demands no more. The doubting soul need not ask, Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up His tender mercies? The answer comes clear and strong, \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" [John 3:16].",
