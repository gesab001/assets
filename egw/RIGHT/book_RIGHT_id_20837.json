    "word": "The clouds with which human agencies have covered the truth will soon be dissipated. The truth that has not been clearly discerned, will be opened before those who search for it as for hid treasure. The Holy Spirit will descend in power upon His people, explaining many mysteries. \"And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, . . . saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know . . . [Him], from the least of them unto the greatest.\" The Sun of Righteousness shall beam forth and penetrate to all depths, and reach to all heights, and the earth shall be filled with His glory. Let all dissension and strife and selfish thoughts be cherished no longer. \"The night is far spent, the day is at hand.\"--Letter 31, 1897. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Sept. 8, 1988. Entire Letter.",
