    "word": "1227. Christians must practise temperance in all things. We have no right to neglect the body and strength and soul and mind, which are to be given to the Lord in consecrated service. We are made up of body and senses, as well as of conscience and affections. Our impulses and passions have their seat in the body; therefore there must be no abuse of any of our organs.--U. T., Sept. 27, 1896.",
