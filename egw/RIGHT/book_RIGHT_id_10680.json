    "word": "For the joy that was set before Him, Christ endured the cross, despising the shame, and is forever set down at the right hand of God. He died on the cross as a sacrifice for the world, and through this sacrifice comes the greatest blessing that God could bestow,-- the gift of the Holy Spirit. This blessing is for all who will receive Christ.",
