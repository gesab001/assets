    "word": "MR No. 1178 - Building and Managing Sanitariums and Other Health Institutions\n\n          (Written in September, 1887, at Battle Creek, Michigan.) \n\n     I have received letters from different States asking me to answer their inquiries in regard to the wisdom of investing means in building sanitariums, where the sick may be treated and where there could be a right influence exerted to point sick souls to Jesus, who is the Great Physician of the soul as well as of the body. This is a question that cannot be answered in quick, Italian fashion with \"Yes\" or \"No.\" There are many sides to this question.",
