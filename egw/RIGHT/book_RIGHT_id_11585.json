    "word": "The black balls which were shown me thrown after the saints, were the reproachful falsehoods put in circulation concerning God's people, by those who love and make a lie. The greatest care should be taken to live a blameless life, and abstain from all appearance of evil, and then move boldly forward, and pay no regard to the reproachful falsehoods of the wicked. While the eyes of the righteous are fixed upon the heavenly, priceless treasure, they will be more and more like Christ, and will be transformed, and fitted for translation.",
