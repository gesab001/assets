    "word": "We must not question whether we shall have trials. It is always best to be on the Lord's side. More than one scandal has followed me. Should this drive me away from Jesus because I was a partaker with His suffering? We are commanded to take up the cross and follow Him. He suffered reproach that we might be saved from death. Christ says, \"If you love Me, keep My commandments.\"  And if we comply it is an evidence that we love Him. \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" [Revelation 22:14].--Ms 47, 1886, pp. 1-5. (Sermon, \"Keep My Commandments,\" November 14, 1886.) \n\nReleased March 7, 1973.",
