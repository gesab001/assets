    "word": "The same spirit that was moving the priests and rulers had moved the heart and mind of Cain to slay his brother. It is the apostasy from truth that worketh in the children of disobedience to silence the voice of those who are calling them to obedience, and provoke the loyal to become disloyal as Cain tried to provoke Abel. A demoniacal spirit takes possession of men in our world. They combine the perverted animal life with the perverted human animal, intelligence making them human demons, detestable in the sight of God in proportion as they manifest the attributes of the satanic. Demon intelligence, by culture, will rend and destroy man formed in the divine similitude because he \n\n\n                                    -165- \n\ncannot control the conscience of his brother and make him disloyal to God's holy law, because he himself is unrighteous like Cain who was disobedient.",
