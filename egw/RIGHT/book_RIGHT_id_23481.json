He says to us, Render back to Me the tithes and gifts and offerings, as a token of your loyalty to Me, and of your dependence upon Me, and I will bless you, and you shall be channels of blessing. Your gratitude offerings will be a token of your sense of obligation to Me. The gratitude that ends simply in words, has no particular value; for faith is made perfect by works, and without works your profession of faith is of no worth. God is continually giving, and the human agent is continually receiving. When we become weary of returning to the Lord His own, His blessing will be withheld from us. As long as we are dependent upon God's bounty, our obligations to render gratitude offerings to Him are upon us. \n\n\n                                              (signed) \n\n\n                                                 Ellen G.
