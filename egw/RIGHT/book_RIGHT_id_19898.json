    "word": "The first page of the periodical for our youth bears the pictures of men, with a footnote explaining that the publishers have received permission to place them there. Books and papers that contain little of present truth are exalted. When the hearts of converted men are filled with the great and awful truths that are living issues for this time, they will understand the deep importance of the message they are to bear to a perishing world. But many of the watchmen are asleep. The day of the Lord is right upon us. As a thief it is coming, with stealthy, muffled tread, and it will take unawares all who are not watching. God pity the people when the watchmen are asleep.",
