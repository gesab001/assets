    "word": "We cannot provide a robe of righteousness for ourselves, for the prophet says, \"All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags\" (Isaiah 64:6). There is nothing in us from which we can clothe the soul so that its nakedness shall not appear. We are to receive the robe of righteousness woven in the loom of heaven, even the spotless robe of Christ's righteousness. We are to say, \"He died for me. He bore my soul's disgrace, that in His name I might be an overcomer and be exalted to His throne.\"",
