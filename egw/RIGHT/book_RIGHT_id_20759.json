    "word": "One book was published when another, just preceding it on the same subject, had not had sufficient time to be brought before the people. The second book was drawing the attention from the sale of the first. The rules of right and righteousness are disregarded for selfish, ambitious purposes. The rights of brethren are to be respected; there should not be a multiplication of books, when it must be well understood that one will interfere with the sale of the one just preceding it. This was the way with The Great Controversy. This book was not even left to have a fair chance in being handled with Bible Readings. The Bible Readings was brought in before the books of great importance--Great Controversy and Daniel and Revelation--which relate to the vital interests before us. Through the special instruction to the canvassing agents, The Great Controversy had little opportunity to be circulated, and the very light which the people needed for that time was nearly eclipsed. \n\n\n                                    -197-",
