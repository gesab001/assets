    "word": "Friday, April 29, 1859--Took dinner at old Brother Cramer's and continued our journey to Wright. Roads bad. Bridge swept away at Berlin. We are obliged to ford the stream; water up to the wagon box. It was hard, dangerous, climbing the bank on the other side of the stream. No accident befell us, which ought to call from our hearts gratitude. Arrived at Brother Root's about six o'clock. Sister Root has a babe one week old. She is very smart. Sits up the most of the time.",
