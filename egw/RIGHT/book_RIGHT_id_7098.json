    "word": "Chap. 88 - Negative Influences on the Mind\n\n\n     Set Aside all Faultfinding.--We should be weeding out of our thoughts all complaining and faultfinding. Let us not continue to look upon any defects that we may see. . . . If we would get the right hold on God, we must keep beholding the great precious things--the purity, the glory, the power, the kindness, the affection, the love, that God bestows upon us. And thus beholding, our minds will become so fixed upon these things of eternal interest that we shall have no desire to find the flaws in others. --MS 153, 1907. (HC 232.)",
