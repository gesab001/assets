    "word": "No man or woman is excused in ease or indolence in this great or solemn work. We cannot copy the example of the world at all in anything. There must be no needless expenditure of God's intrusted capital. There must be a binding about of our supposed wants. Life is valuable, too full of solemn sacred responsibility to be used in pleasing self. Let men and women consecrate themselves to the work. They must be loyal to Jesus Christ and reveal their love to men, by letting their light shine forth in clear bright rays to the world. Every one must now rise superior to every phase of self indulgence, and selfishness, and \n                                                                           860\nlive their lives to God, abiding in Christ. Every one who knows Christ by experimental knowledge will copy his example. They will constantly endeavor to rise higher and still higher, not seeking the friendship of the world, but possessing a high and sanctified ambition to copy the example of Christ, in perfection of Christian character and be co-laborers together with God. They are not to praise men, or to seek the praise of men, for all praise and all glory belongs to God.",
