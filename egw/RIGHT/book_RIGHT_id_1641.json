    "word": "It is not a great number of institutions, large buildings, and outward display that God requires, but the harmonious action of a peculiar people, a people chosen by God and precious, united with one another, their life hid with Christ in God.

When all God's workers do this, and not till then, His work will be a complete, symmetrical whole.  8T 1837",
