    "word": "I will not allow my mind to dwell on the dark side. Jesus has light and comfort and hope and joy for me. I want to face the light, that the brightness of the Sun of Righteousness may shine into my heart, and be reflected to others. It is the duty of every Christian to shine--to shed abroad the light of the grace that Christ imparts. God would have me, even in my pain, praise Him, showing that I realize that His presence is with me. \"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God.\" \"This is the record, that God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.\" Whatever else the sin of Adam did, it did not give human beings an excuse for transgressing God's law.",
