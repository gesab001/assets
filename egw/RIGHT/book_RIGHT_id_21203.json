    "word": "I hope that you will all have faith for yourselves. Have an object before you and a high purpose to glorify God. Resist inclination, and ever be true to duty, true to the pure principles of right. Seek earnestly for communion with God. Pray, my children. Pray earnestly and watch thereunto constantly. I hope this Sabbath will be precious to you, my dear children. Let not your love for the truth wane for one hour; cling to God by living faith. Seek to bring yourselves nearer and closer to His divine presence. May God preserve your lives and keep you pure from the pollution of the world, is the prayer of your father and mother.--Letter 20, 1872. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nFebruary 28, 1991. Entire Letter.",
