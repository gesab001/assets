    "word": "What saith our Saviour? \"I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.\"  \"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\"  When trials overshadow the soul, remember the words of Christ, remember that He is an unseen presence in the person of the Holy Spirit, and He will be the peace and comfort given you, manifesting to you that He is with you, the Sun of Righteousness, chasing away your darkness. \"If a man love me,\" Christ said, \"he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\"  Be of good cheer; light will come, and your soul will rejoice greatly in the Lord.--Letter 124, 1897.",
