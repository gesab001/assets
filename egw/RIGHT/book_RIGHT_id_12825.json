    "word": "Both of you have professed to be servants of Christ. How necessary that you should obey your Master's directions and be faithful to your duties. \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" This love is without a parallel, giving to men the relationship of sons to God. Therefore the Father expects obedience from His children; therefore He requires a right disposition of the property He has placed in their hands. It is not their own to use for their personal gratification; but it is the capital of the Lord, for which they are responsible to Him.",
