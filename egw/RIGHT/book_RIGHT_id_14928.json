    "word": "Unite with your companion in searching the Scriptures. The Holy Spirit will help those who seek the Lord in order to know how to do His work. While you seek to obtain perfection of Christian character, be helpers wherever you are. Praise the Lord at all times. Look on the bright side of circumstances, not on the dark side. Be watchful and prayerful, and the Lord will bless and guide and strengthen you. See how much you can do to bless others.",
