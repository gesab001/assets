    "word": "How We Are to Serve God.--We are not to serve God as if we were not human, but we are to serve Him in the nature we have, that has been redeemed by the Son of God; through the righteousness of Christ we shall stand before God pardoned, and as though we had never sinned. We will never gain strength in considering what we might do if we were angels. We are to turn in faith to Jesus Christ, and show our love to God through obedience \n                                                                           141\nto His commands. Jesus \"was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\" Jesus says, \"Follow me.\" \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\"-- Manuscript 1, 1892.",
