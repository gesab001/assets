    "word": "Not to Open Door of Temptation.--I have had this before me time and time again.  I have put it in writing for fear I might be taken away.  But I want to say that we must step up onto a higher plane of action, and if we will do this the Lord will let His blessing rest upon us.  I have had so many letters from women and from men about their falling right under the temptations of the devil as they were brought in connection with the childbirth of women.  I do not need to argue this because your own sense will tell you that we are in a world of temptation and trial.  And we are to purify ourselves from every such thing.  God help us.  You have no need to have me dwell upon this any longer.  The light given me is that we open the door to temptation and for transgression.  Let us have just as much a duty to take the burden that rests upon the women for the women in childbirth as it is possible for us to do.  This is the right as it is presented to me.--13MR 116 (1911).",
