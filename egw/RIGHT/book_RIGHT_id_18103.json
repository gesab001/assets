    "word": "O man, the books of heaven bear the record of your deeds; for to every transaction there has been a Witness that will not lie, and by thy works thou shalt be justified, and by thy works thou shalt be condemned in the day when every case is tried, and it is too late for wrongs to be righted. Then it will be seen that only those are saved who brought into their life the maxims of Jesus.",
