    "word": "The perishing sinner may say: \"I am a lost sinner; but Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost. He says, `I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.' I am a sinner, and He died upon Calvary's cross to save me. I need not remain a moment longer unsaved. He died and rose again for my justification, and He will save me now. I accept the forgiveness He has promised.\" . . .",
