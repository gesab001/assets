    "word": "We believe God will lead them; therefore, we are fully in harmony with this unity, and we believe heaven is in harmony with it. Therefore, these young people who have worked in the cause of God, who have tried to do His work, can now double their influence, increase their capabilities and their talents, by blending in the work of God. It is not a lesser work that is before them, but it is a higher, it is a more sacred, it is a more important work that they will have to do in the future than in the past. May the blessing of God rest upon them right here.",
