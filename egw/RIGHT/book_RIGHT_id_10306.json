    "word": "(Revelation 5:11.) Not in a State of Solitude and Grandeur.--Do not let your thoughts dwell upon yourselves. Think of Jesus. He is in His holy place, not in a state of solitude and grandeur, but surrounded by ten thousand times ten thousand of heavenly beings who wait to do their Master's bidding. And He bids them go and work for the weakest saint who puts his trust in God. High and low, rich and poor, have the same help provided (Letter 134, 1899).  {7BC 933.10} \n \n                            Chapter 10 \n\n     1-7.

Entering the Sanctuary With Christ.--This is the great day of atonement, and our Advocate is standing before the Father, pleading as our intercessor. In place of wrapping about us the garments of self-righteousness, we should be found daily humbling ourselves before God, confessing our own individual sins, seeking the pardon of our transgressions, and cooperating with Christ in the work of preparing our souls to reflect the divine image. Unless we enter the sanctuary above, and unite with Christ in working out our own salvation with fear and trembling, we shall be weighed in \n                                                                           934\nthe balances of the sanctuary, and shall be pronounced wanting (MS 168, 1898).  {7BC 933.14} \n     23.
