    "word": "We read that many of the priests believed on Jesus, but it stopped right there. They did not confess Him because they were afraid of being turned out of the Sanhedrin. Are there any here today who say, \"Do you think that if I had lived then I would have united with those that cried 'Crucify Him'?\" Well, prove it by obeying the light of today. You are not responsible for those that with hoarse voice cried out when Pilate said, \"Who shall I deliver unto you?\" Who do you suppose it was that led those minds to say that? It was Satan, and when men reject light, when they grieve the Spirit of God, there is somebody ready to pick them up. It is the prince of darkness in our world striving for every soul, and we do not want to file under his banner. We want to stand under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel.",
