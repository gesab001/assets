    "word": "The Lord has mercifully spared the mother the greater sorrow, which would have been a living sorrow, had her little ones lived. The mother must educate herself to look with reconciliation upon her present sorrows. It is well with those that are not [living]. She will, if faithful, meet them again in the morning of the resurrection. The Lord has mercifully softened the affliction ever before her eyes, of the birthright given to her son who is deficient in reason through the besotted father.",
