    "word": "No Sleepy Message at This Time--At Christ's first advent the angels broke the silence of the night with acclamations of praise, and proclaimed, \"Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth; good will toward men.\" He is soon to come again with power and great glory. Those who are not wedded to the world will realize that the time demands something more than a weak, faint, methodical discourse. They will see that there must be earnestness and power accompanying the Word, which will arouse the powers of hell to oppose the warnings. God designs to come to the people to awaken men out of their carnal security, that they may prepare themselves for the great event right upon us. The promise is, \"Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you:  and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\" God will accept no sleepy, tame message at this time.--Lt 27, 1894.",
