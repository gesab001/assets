    "word": "Parents need to arouse to a sense of their grave responsibility, and be interested in the salvation of their children. They have a heaven to win, a hell to shun. It means much to bring up the children in the love and fear of God. It means more than many realize. We should be just as faithful in fulfilling these duties day by day as we expect God to be faithful in imparting to us our daily blessings. God wants us to cooperate with Him. He wants us to come to a right understanding of what our relation to these children should be. It is time that we understood this, and determined to follow the will of the Lord for ourselves and for our children.",
