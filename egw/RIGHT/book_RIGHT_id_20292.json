    "word": "MR No. 1219 - The Marketplace and Cathedral in Cologne\n\n     (Fragment of a letter written May 27, 1887, from Cologne, Germany.) \n\n     Well, I must stop. Of all the sights I have seen, this is the greatest--of market women. They come, young women and old, gray-headed women, with heavy baskets upon their heads, full of vegetables and fruits. They have every kind of produce. Their dresses are tucked up, formed about them, for it is raining. Hundreds of women have passed, and now comes another crowd. One girl of about eighteen has a very large basket on her head and two heavy baskets on one arm and still another basket on the other arm. She is as straight as an arrow, and looks not to the right or left.",
