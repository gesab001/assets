    "word": "Jesus teaches the poor not to rise up against those who are in power, not to resist their oppression, while He pronounces a terrible woe upon those who tyrannize over the poor. \"Go to, now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.\" God enjoins upon the servant to be faithful to his master, and to be contented for Christ's sake; but He assures the master that he also has a Master who will requite him full measure for his deeds. \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" We do not receive forgiveness because we forgive, but as we forgive. The ground of all forgiveness is that Christ died, that while we were yet sinners He died for us. Repentance and faith are the conditions of our salvation. Lesson after lesson is given the student in Christ's school that he may learn to trust, not in his own merits, but in the merits of Christ's righteousness. \n\n\n                             -186-",
