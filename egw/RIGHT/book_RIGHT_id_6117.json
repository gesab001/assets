    "word": "\"Rejoice in the Lord alway,\" says the apostle; \"and again I say, Rejoice.\" Wherever we go, we should carry an atmosphere of Christian hopefulness and cheer; then those who are out of Christ will see attractiveness in the religion we profess; unbelievers will see the consistency of our faith. We need to have more distinct glimpses of heaven, the land where all is brightness and joy. We need to know more of the fullness of the blessed hope. If we are constantly \"rejoicing in hope,\" we shall be able to speak words of encouragement to those whom we meet. \"A word spoken in due season, how good is it!\" Souls are perishing for the lack of personal labor.",
