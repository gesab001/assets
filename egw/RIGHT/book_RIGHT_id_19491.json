    "word": "Sr. Tuxford and I were walking out one day when an aged man, venerable in appearance, came toward me with every expression of joy upon his countenance. He grasped my hand and said, \"How glad I am to see you. My son just saw you from his grocery store and said, `There is Mrs. White coming down the hill.'\" Said he, I did not wait one minute. I rushed out to meet you and speak with you. I heard you preach several times in Auckland. And I thank the Lord your words went right to my heart.\" The son came up and introduced the aged gentleman as his father. The son is also interested in the truth. He has a license as an exhorter from the Wesleyan church.",
