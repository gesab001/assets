    "word": "Thank God, we all have a hope that reaches to the grave. When we die, we do not go immediately to heaven. But if the Lord calls us to die, and we \n\n\n                                   -393- \n\nhave been faithful in His service, we may lie down with the expectation that when Christ comes to raise the dead, we shall hear His voice and be brought out of our graves. Our flesh may rest in hope. When the righteous shall come forth from their graves, what a rejoicing there will be! [Verses 32-39, quoted.]",
