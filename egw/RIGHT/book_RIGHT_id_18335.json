    "word": "Can you tell me why the Son of God came to die for us? It was because of the transgression of Adam. In this he forfeited all right to heaven. Man then became separated from God, but Christ's love for man caused Him to come to this earth, and He clothed His divinity with humanity that man might be reconciled to the Father and brought back to His law. Christ says that He came not to destroy the law, but He came to honor it, to give dignity to it. He opened His bosom to suffer for the transgression.",
