    "word": "The Lord evidently designs to cut you clear from any earthly dependence and to teach you the precious lessons of entire trust in Him. The Holy Spirit has been grieved that you have not surrendered your will to God's will, and years have passed into eternity, that might have been rich in good works for the saving of souls. I wish I could communicate all that is in my mind upon some points, but today the mail leaves for America, and I have not been able to write as much as I desired. Since I came to Melbourne the work has been pressing urgently upon me. I have spoken in Brighton and in Williams-town, where the interest is excellent, and the field ripe for the harvest. The weather has been very warm, and it has been taxing to speak under the tent, but I have reason to praise my heavenly Father that he grants me so largely of His Holy Spirit, that I can continue to bear the message of His grace and love in demonstration of His Spirit. The congregations listen with profound interest. Should I not praise God for this with heart and soul and voice?",
