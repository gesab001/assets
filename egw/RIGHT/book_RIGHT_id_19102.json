    "word": "We held the dedicatory service on the morning of September 29 in a room which had been used as a dance hall, but which will now serve as a chapel. The room will seat about 200 persons. The room was filled with our people, and several of the leading brethren of the Conference were present to take part in the exercises. As the school is at present it is thought that it will accommodate about 100 students very nicely; but as the numbers increase, enlargements will have to be made. The students themselves can learn how to erect buildings under the instruction of capable teachers. Timber can be prepared right on the ground for this work, and the students can be taught how to build in a creditable manner.",
