    "word": "Do not keep your mind fixed on the defective example of professing Christians. You will, of course, see in their lives things that are not right. But if you keep looking at their faults, you will become like them. Instead of looking at the lives of your fellowmen, look to Jesus. There you will see no imperfection, but perfection, righteousness, goodness, mercy, and truth. \n                                                                           42\nTake the Saviour as your example in all things. It is in looking to men instead of beholding Christ that you have made your great mistake.",
