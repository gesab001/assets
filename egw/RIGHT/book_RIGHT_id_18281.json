    "word": "Children are exhorted to obey their parents in the Lord, but parents are also enjoined, \"Provoke not your children to wrath, lest they be discouraged.\" Do not treat them in such a way that they will think that there is no use trying to be good and to do right, for they are treated with injustice and in an unreasonable manner. Children born into the world in this age have many difficulties to encounter. Sin will lie at the door of parents unless they take themselves in hand and qualify themselves to become wise, safe, Christian teachers.",
