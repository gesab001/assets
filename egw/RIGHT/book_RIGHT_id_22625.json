    "word": "There is a most earnest call for us to visit Kaikoura. They have no minister. Brother Paap is their leader. He begged of me to furnish them with reading matter, and for the discourses he heard me preach in Napier. I gave him some to use now. I cannot feel it my duty to go to visit them, because there is only one means of going there, and it is by a little boat, which is obliged to anchor here a week or two some times until they have a smooth sea because of the treacherous harbour at Kaikoura. But I dislike to say no to such urgent invitations. They have a number of sons and I think two daughters. Two of the sons are at Healdsburg College, and two I expect will attend the Melbourne school. These boys are almost giants in height, and are robust. They tell us Kaikoura is healthful and beautiful. They will send down their children to meet us here if I cannot go. They have built them a neat little church, and their membership is twenty-five. We see so many places to visit we know not what we shall do. To call upon all would take many months. Wherever I speak Canright's works are killed. I feel deeply over this field. How much time we should spend here is a question. If we do that which looks as if we must do to put a right mold upon the work, we shall not see America very soon. We have made only a beginning.",
