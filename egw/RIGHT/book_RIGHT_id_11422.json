AND SISTER WHITE, WE FEEL CALLED UPON TO TESTIFY THAT WE HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH THEM AND THEIR COURSE SINCE 1844, AND THEREFORE KNOW THAT ANY STATEMENTS THAT WOULD REPRESENT THEM AS BEING IN ANY WISE CONNECTED WITH, OR COUNTENANCING IN ANY DEGREE, THOSE FANATICAL ABOMINATIONS INTO WHICH SOME IN MAINE AND ELSEWHERE WERE DRAWN DURING THE YEARS 1844-1846, ARE WICKED AND MALICIOUS FALSEHOODS. WE HAVE NEVER KNOWN THEM TO BE IN THE LEAST INFECTED WITH THE SPIRIT OR WORKS OF FANATICISM, BUT ON THE CONTRARY, AS THE UNTIRING AND UNFLINCHING OPPOSERS OF THE SAME. \n     H. N.
