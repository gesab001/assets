    "word": "Trying as your case may be, do not yield to despondency. Guard yourself here. Your heart may ache near to breaking, but trust on, hope on. \"For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men\" (Lamentations 3:33). Never allow yourself to mourn. Be hopeful, be ever cheerful in God, and brighter morning will yet arrive.",
