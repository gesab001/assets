    "word": "He in whose heart Christ abides is willing to be pleased. He thinks no evil, and is content with the assurance that Jesus knows and values aright every soul for whom He died. God says, \"I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man \n\n\n                                     -118- \n\nthan the golden wedge of Ophir.\" Let this satisfy the longing of the soul, and make us careful and guarded, very ready to forgive others because God has forgiven us.",
