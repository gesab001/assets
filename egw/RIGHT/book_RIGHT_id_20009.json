    "word": "The signs of Christ's coming are fulfilling. Time is precious, too precious to be frittered away. God needs men who will give the warning message, and men who will sell and give alms, that the work of warning may not be hindered. The work has been and is being bound about by the erection of large, expensive buildings, as if these buildings would proclaim the last message of mercy to a guilty world. There is money enough to carry forward the work if all will act as God's stewards, giving back to Him His own. The strictest economy is to be exercised. The aggressive warfare is to be carried forward with firmness and determination, for Satan has come down with great power to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.--Letter 28, 1900. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. November 8, 1984. Entire Letter.",
