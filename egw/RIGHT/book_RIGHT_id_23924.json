    "word": "Christ accepts and communes with the most lowly, He does not accept men because of their capabilities or eloquence, but because they seek His face, desiring His help. His spirit moving upon the heart arouses every faculty to vigorous action. In these unpretentious ones the Lord sees the most precious material, which will stand storm and tempest, heat and pressure. God sees not as man sees. He judges not from appearance. He searches the heart and judges righteously.",
