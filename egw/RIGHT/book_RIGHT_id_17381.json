    "word": "\"We must live a twofold life of thought and action, silent prayer and earnest work. All who have received the light of truth should feel it their duty to shed rays of light upon \n\n\n                      -39- \n\nthe pathway of the impenitent. They should be witnesses for Christ in our offices as verily as in the church. God requires us to be living epistles, known and read of all men.
