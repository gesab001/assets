    "word": "There is a lack with some men of thorough decision and defined positions as to what is truth. Nothing but most earnest, clear, determined decision, and full surrender to God, will break the spell. With some their own course of action in thought and purpose is deciding their eternal destiny. Some have become confused by a continued course of action of men in responsible positions, because they know them not to be true and decided for truth and righteousness. Do they turn from idols which they have created? No, no. Old habits come in and are invited to stay and rule the heart.",
