    "word": "When Jesus came to be baptized, John shrank from granting His request. How could he, a sinner, baptize the sinless One? \"I have need to be baptized of Thee,\" he exclaimed, \"and comest Thou to me?\" Jesus answered, \"Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.\" John yielded, and buried his Lord beneath the water. Straightway coming up out of the water, Christ bowed in prayer on the riverbank. And for what did He pray? He lifted up His soul unto God in behalf of fallen humanity, and for strength to fulfill His mission. Upon His arm depended the salvation of the fallen race, and He reached out His hand to grasp the hand of Omnipotent Love. He asked for the witness that God accepted humanity in the person of His Son.",
