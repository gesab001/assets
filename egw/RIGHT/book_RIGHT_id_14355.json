    "word": "I can write but little now. I have written so much for the last mail that I am too weary to write. In the night season I was speaking to you in the visions of my head upon by bed. I said that the company of believers were neglecting their God-given work. They have been in the condition which Christ represents by the salt without the savour. They need the Holy Spirit, and they will not have it unless they arouse themselves and do the works of Christ. They are to give to the world the light the Lord has given them. Unless they shall practise the truth, the truth will not sanctify their own souls nor the souls of others. With hearts full of earnestness and light they are to communicate to others the light given them. \u201cI Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\u201d",
