    "word": "The God who gave His only begotten Son to die for the redemption of the sinful race, will not approve the management of the table for workers at the Sanitarium. The money saved by limiting the table supplies, by not providing fresh, wholesome food, and not taking pains to get a right preparation in food, but to provide odds and ends, is a loss. The ones who give the treatment and care for the sick are taxed in their labor, and must have greater privileges than have been given them, if their hearts are to be kept from temptation and corruption. This line of work has been neglected. Let the education be given line upon line, precept upon precept, that we all are servants. All work done is serving ministers of the gospel.",
