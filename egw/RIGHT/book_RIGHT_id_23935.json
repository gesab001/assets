When will they be true to the principles of health reform? When will they learn that it is dangerous to use flesh-meat? I am instructed to say that if ever meat eating were safe, it is not safe now. Diseased animals are taken to the large cities, and to the villages, and sold for food. Many of these poor creatures would have died of disease in a very short time, if they had not been slaughtered; yet the carcasses of these diseased animals are prepared for the market, and people eat freely of this poisonous food. Such a diet contaminates the blood and stimulates the lower passions.",
