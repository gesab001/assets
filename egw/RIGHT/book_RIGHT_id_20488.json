    "word": "God fulfills His promise in such a way as to bring the highest glory to Himself and the greatest good to His people. In order to be righteous in His sight, we must not only believe in Christ, but we must depend upon Him for the realization of our highest hopes of success and of salvation, observing all His commandments and ordinances, and discharging with fidelity all the duties that devolve upon us as stewards of His grace. We shall be judged by the fruits that we bear. We do not strike deep enough, taking root in the best soil, the Word of the living God, that we may grow in strength and bear the fruits of the Spirit. In spirit, in word, and in action it is our privilege to be rich in good works.",
