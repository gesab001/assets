    "word": "Those who will never admit that they are wrong, feel injured when reproved, and bring forth reasons as numerous as vain, to justify themselves. They always think that they are right, and so continue to practice their wrong habits, thus making it more and more improbable that they will reform. They are too indolent to put forth a determined effort to make reformation. Cautions, counsels, prayers, entreaties, result in making little change in their course of action. They do not see that they are defective, and are satisfied with their own erroneous way of doing, and think that every one else should be a satisfied with them as they are with themselves. They see no necessity for reproof and counsel. The Word of God describes such cases in this language: \"Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him.\"",
