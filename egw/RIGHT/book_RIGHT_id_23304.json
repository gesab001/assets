    "word": "We are not half awake. . . . I was so astonished when I came back the first time after we had been gone nearly ten years in Australia, to see nothing being done scarcely at all in San Francisco and Oakland. There was so little being done! Well, I tried to inquire into it,--what it meant. \"Oh, well\" they said, they had men out. \"How many have you?\" \"How many will it take in the manner you are doing the work?\" Well, they said they had other duties to do, but they did not tell me what they were doing, and there the very work they ought to be doing-- there was only one man going round and visiting, and he was not competent, he did not have the experience he needed and was a man of incompetency. But what right had that minister to do as he did, unless he would take a company and with them get out and hold meetings in different sections. God wants active men. He \n\n\n                             -536- \n\nwants men that will work. He wants men that will (889) understand that there is work for them to do. They can go in and give Bible readings. We know, because we have seen that accomplished. We have advised it and they have done it and the Spirit of the Lord has blessed their labors, but not one thousandth part has been done in these cities that ought to have been done. That is what is presented to me.",
