    "word": "Of the poor in spirit Jesus says, \"Their's is the kingdom of heaven.\" This kingdom is not, as Christ's hearers had hoped, a temporal and earthly dominion. Christ was opening to them the spiritual kingdom of His love, His grace, His righteousness. ... His subjects are the poor in spirit, the meek, the persecuted for righteousness' sake. The kingdom of heaven is theirs. Though not yet fully accomplished, the work is begun in them which will make them \"meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light\" (Colossians 1:12).",
