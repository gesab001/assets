PAGE 573.\u2014THESE MOVEMENTS ARE APPARENT UNDER DIVERSE FORMS AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT THE ORGANIZATION WHICH EMBODIES ALMOST EVERY FORM, AND WORKS IN EVERY WAY TO GAIN ITS END, IS THE NATIONAL REFORM ASSOCIATION. IT ORIGINATED IN A CONFERENCE REPRESENTING \u201cELEVEN DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS OF CHRISTIANS FROM SEVEN OF THE STATES OF THE UNION.\u201d IT NOW HAS THE SUPPORT OF PROMINENT MEN FROM \u201cALL BRANCHES OF THE CHURCH,\u201d OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNION, AND THE PROHIBITION PARTY. IT PROPOSES TO HAVE OUR NATIONAL CONSTITUTION AMENDED, \u201cIN ORDER TO CONSTITUTE A CHRISTIAN GOVERNMENT,\u201d \u201cACKNOWLEDGING ALMIGHTY GOD AS THE SOURCE OF ALL AUTHORITY AND POWER IN CIVIL GOVERNMENT, THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AS THE RULER AMONG THE NATIONS, HIS REVEALED WILL AS THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND;\u201d AND SO PLACING \u201cALL CHRISTIAN LAWS, INSTITUTIONS, AND USAGES OF OUR GOVERNMENT ON AN UNDENIABLE LEGAL BASIS IN THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THE LAND.\u201d ONE OF ITS PROPOSITIONS, ANNOUNCED BY DAVID GREGG, D. D., PASTOR PARK STREET CHURCH, \n689\nBOSTON, IS THAT THE STATE HAS \u201cTHE RIGHT TO COMMAND THE CONSCIENCES OF MEN.\u201d ANOTHER, ANNOUNCED BY THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN, IS THAT GOVERNMENT MUST \u201cENFORCE UPON ALL THAT COME AMONG US THE LAWS OF CHRISTIAN MORALITY.\u201d ANOTHER, ANNOUNCED BY THE REV. E. B. GRAHAM, IS THAT \u201cIF THE OPPONENTS OF THE BIBLE DO NOT LIKE OUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS CHRISTIAN FEATURES, LET THEM GO TO SOME WILD, DESOLATE LAND; AND, IN THE NAME OF THE DEVIL, AND FOR THE SAKE OF THE DEVIL, SUBDUE IT, AND SET UP A GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN ON INFIDEL AND ATHEISTIC IDEAS, AND THEN, IF THEY CAN STAND IT, STAY THERE TILL THEY DIE.\u201d ANOTHER, ANNOUNCED BY JONATHAN EDWARDS, D. D., IS THAT JEWS, AND ALL CHRISTIANS WHO KEEP THE SEVENTH DAY, ARE TO BE CLASSED AS ATHEISTS, AND \u201cMUST BE TREATED, AS FOR THIS [NATIONAL REFORM] QUESTION, ONE PARTY\u201d WITH ATHEISTS, WHO \u201cCANNOT DWELL TOGETHER ON THE SAME CONTINENT\u201d WITH THE NATIONAL REFORM CHRISTIANITY.",
