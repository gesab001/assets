    "word": "The path of uprightness is the path of peace. Those who have the meekness and lowliness of Christ can walk this humble path calmly, restfully, trustfully. No matter what may be our temperament, we may walk this path if we will. It is plain, and there is no need of constant anxiety and fear, fretting and worry, lest we shall lose the way. This path is the highway of holiness, cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in. It is the glorious path of the just, which \u201cshineth more and more unto the perfect day.\u201d [Proverbs 4:18.] Those who walk in this way will wear a cheerful, happy countenance; for it is lighted up by bright beams from the Sun of Righteousness.",
