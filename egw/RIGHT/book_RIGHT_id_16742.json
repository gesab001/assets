Those who know the truth are not to call for constant labor from the ministers. Let the believers, so far as possible, do the work of the church, and keep up the meetings, leaving the ministers free to labor in new fields. In the third chapter of Malachi is instruction for us at this time: \"Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.\"",
