    "word": "In this, the great day of atonement, it is our duty to confess our sins and acknowledge God's mercy and love in pardoning our transgressions. Let us thank the Lord for the warnings he has given to save us from our perverse ways. Let us witness to his goodness by revealing a change in our lives. If those to whom the Lord has sent reproof, warning them that they are not walking in his way, will repent and with humility and contrition of heart make confession, the Lord will surely receive them again into favor. If they will honor God by obeying his commandments, they will be exalted by him. He will teach them what constitutes true honor and strength and victory. Those who despise the word of the Lord, who, although they have the oracles of God to reprove wrong and encourage righteousness, continue to walk in their own way, indulging their desire for self-exaltation and leading those who have confidence in them into wrong paths will, unless utterly forsaken by God, become weary of themselves.",
