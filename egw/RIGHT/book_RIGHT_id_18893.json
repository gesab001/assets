    "word": "You will not educate your children to respect those who are older and those who are laborers together with God. You yourselves have been exacting teachers. You have needed caution in regard to being so severe if all respect and due attention was not given to your words of instruction. You have a little school in your own family and you need to move as parents wisely. If you consider that every expressed wish to your little ones must be gratified, you will make them selfish and their wishes will multiply and be predominating. In visiting our people in other places, the education you give your children will make them an annoyance and I advise you now to leave them \n\n\n                                       -5- \n\nat home for it is evident they are placed on exhibition as prodigies of smartness and the good you might accomplish as laborers together with God in families you visit is not done. It is not pleasant to you to be separated from your children and let others have a care for them. But I learned in our labors the formation of right character in my children required this. The continual changing brought the children to notice and to the hearing of remarks calculating to indulgence, and praising and petting brought into their education a love of self and the idea that they were to be administered to as the all important part of the program.",
