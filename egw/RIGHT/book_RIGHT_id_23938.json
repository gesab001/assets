    "word": "The establishment of the work in Nashville was in God's order. In and around Nashville there are large colleges built for the education of the colored people. These grand buildings stand as representatives of a great and good work that is being done for this race. The Lord has favored and blessed those who have given themselves to this work. It was in the order of God that Seventh-day Adventists should enter Nashville. I was instructed that memorials for God were to be established in this place, not only right in the city, but at a little distance from it. Efforts were to be made to reach both the white and colored people. The medical missionary work was to be established there; for it is the right hand of the gospel. But the work would have to move slowly; for there was not much means with which to carry it on. The work was not to be carried forward as a private business, but as a conference enterprise.",
