    "word": "We must be able to present the precious truth at the right time. We do not claim that in the doctrines sought out by those who have studied the word of truth, there may not be some error, for no man that lives is infallible; but if God has sent light, we want it; and God has sent light, and let every man be careful how he treats it. As the truth is proclaimed, men will say, \"Be careful now, do not be too zealous, too positive; you want the truth.\" Of course we want the truth, and we want it as it is in Jesus.",
