    "word": "Thousands upon thousands of people flock to southern California from all parts of the States, to spend the winter here. We are very desirous of getting our work in this part of the State well established, \n\n\n                                 -22- \n\nthat the message of present truth may be given to these people. I have an intense interest in this work. I greatly desire that the tourists coming to Los Angeles, Pasadena, San Diego, and to many other parts of southern California, shall hear the message of warning to prepare for the great day of the Lord, which is right upon us. \"He that shall come will come, and will not tarry\" [Hebrews 10:37].",
