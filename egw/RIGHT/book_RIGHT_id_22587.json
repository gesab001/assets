    "word": "The people of God are to be called out from their association with worldlings and evil-doers, to stand in the battle for the Lord against the powers of darkness. When the earth is lightened with the glory of God, we shall see a work similar to that which was wrought when the disciples, filled with the holy Spirit, proclaimed the power of a risen Saviour. The light of heaven penetrated the darkened minds of those who had been deceived by the enemies of Christ, and the false representation of him was rejected; for through the efficiency of the holy Spirit they now saw him exalted to be a prince and Saviour, to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins. They saw him encircled with the glory of heaven, with infinite treasures in his hands to bestow upon those who turn from their rebellion. As the apostles set forth the glory of the only begotten of the Father, 3,000 souls were pricked to the heart, and they were made to see themselves as they were sinful and polluted, and Christ as their Saviour and Redeemer. Christ was lifted up, Christ was glorified, through the power of the holy Spirit resting upon men. By the eye of faith these believers saw him as the one who had borne humiliation, suffering, and death, that they might not perish, but have everlasting life. As they looked upon his spotless righteousness, they saw their own deformity and pollution, and were filled with godly fear, with love and adoration for Him who gave his life a sacrifice for them. They humbled their souls to the very dust, and repented of their wicked works, and glorified God for his salvation.",
