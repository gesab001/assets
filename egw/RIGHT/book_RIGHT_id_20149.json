    "word": "Consider me not an enemy because I tell you the truth. I long and pray that you may be found in your right mind sitting at the feet of Jesus and learning of Him. If you imitate Christ, you will be willing even to be a servant. He was the King of Glory, yet He was a servant of fallen man. I pray the Lord to help you to get rid of some of your lofty ideas of yourself, and come down in meekness, feeling your nothingness without Christ. Then will He be unto you a very present help in time of need. Then will He make your labors effectual, and souls will be converted from error to truth through your labors.",
