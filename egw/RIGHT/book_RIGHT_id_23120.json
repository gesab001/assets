We hope to see you soon now, but in regard to the purchase of \"Loma Linda\" I will say, Go ahead. I hope to be able to help by giving the proceeds from a certain number of copies of \"Ministry of Healing.\" I can do no more, except to borrow. I wish the place purchased. Do not neglect to tell me all I ought to know. I have been looking over your descriptive letter, and I am well satisfied that the place is one we ought to have. It is cheap at forty thousand dollars. We will not leave you, but will stand back of you, and help you to raise the means. In regard to the right man to manage the institution, I am confident that we shall find some one when the right time comes. \n\n\n                                 (Signed)  Ellen G. White. \n\n                                               -",
