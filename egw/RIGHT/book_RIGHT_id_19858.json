    "word": "MR No. 1022 - Ellen White Declines Offer of Financial Aid\n\n     I received your letter. I was up at half past [four] this morning and found it in my room awaiting me. I think we have sent to you some few days ago the exact thing you call for in regard to [Missionary] Acre Fund. I read it over carefully and it seems to me the right thing. And now comes the long letter from you, which I highly appreciate.",
