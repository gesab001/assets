    "word": "May the Lord turn and overturn in Christiania. Better, far better, would it be today so far as the church is concerned, if a blow had not been struck there until an altogether different mold could have been placed upon the work \n\n\n                                   -106- \n\nand the church. This work may look all right in your eyes, but O, my soul, how it looks in the eyes of the Lord! Now I shall write no more on this, although there are other things I might say in reference to the work as God has presented it before me. Now you can see why I have not desired to come to Christiania again. I am soul-sick. If you stood free and clear, then I should know that God would work for us; but as you have stood, I have no confidence that He will.--Letter 43, 1886. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. July 9, 1987. Entire Letter.",
