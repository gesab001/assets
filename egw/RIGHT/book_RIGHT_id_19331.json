    "word": "MR No. 756 - Title to Heaven\n\n     I know that there is nothing of so great importance as to be getting ready for heaven.  Nothing but the righteousness of Christ can entitle us to the blessings reserved for the redeemed. I am trying most earnestly to commit my all to Him without one reservation. Faith in Jesus' efficacious blood is my only hope, my only stronghold. Jesus is a faithful Saviour. I love His name. I love His cross. I love His Word. I shall never be ashamed while I trust in Him. The promise He has given me, He has signed and sealed with His own blood. Letter 40, 1874, p. 1. (To James White, July 8, 1874.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. January 2, 1980",
