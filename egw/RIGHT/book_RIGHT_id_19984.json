    "word": "Light has been shining in Battle Creek in clear, bright rays; but who of those that acted a part in the meeting at Minneapolis have come to the light and received the rich treasures of truth which the Lord sent them from heaven? Who have kept step and step with the Leader, Jesus Christ? Who have made full confession of their mistaken zeal, their blindness, their \n\n\n                                -110- \n\njealousies and evil surmisings, their defiance of truth? Not one; [IN THE LIGHT OF OTHER ELLEN WHITE STATEMENTS, IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS COMMENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS HYPERBOLE, FOR IN A DOCUMENT WRITTEN JANUARY 9, 1891, ELLEN WHITE WROTE THAT URIAH SMITH \"MADE HIS CONFESSION. HE HAD FALLEN ON THE ROCK AND WAS BROKEN. I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU MY JOY.\"---MANUSCRIPT RELEASE #1092. FOR AN ACCOUNT OF MANY OTHERS WHO ALSO CHANGED THEIR ATTITUDES SEE \"GEORGE I. BUTLER MOVES INTO THE LIGHT,\" \"URIAH SMITH FALLS ON THE 'ROCK,'\" AND \"STILL MORE CONFESSIONS\" IN A. V. OLSON, THIRTEEN CRISIS YEARS, PP. 87-119.] and because of their long neglect to acknowledge the light, it has left them far behind; they have not been growing in grace and in the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord. They have failed to receive the needed grace which they might have had, and which would have made them strong men in religious experience.",
