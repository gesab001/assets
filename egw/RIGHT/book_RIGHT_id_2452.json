    "word": "Teachers, take your position as true educators, and pour into the hearts of the students the living stream of redeeming love. Before their minds are preoccupied with literary work, entreat them to seek Christ and His righteousness. Show them the changes that will surely take place if the heart is given to Christ. Fasten their attention on Him. This will close the door to the foolish aspirations that naturally arise, and will prepare the mind for the reception of divine truth.",
