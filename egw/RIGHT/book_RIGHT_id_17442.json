    "word": "We wish to lay out before you now the fields \n\n                      -16- \n\nthat are unworked. We wish you to see that men can not be trusted unless they have a living connection with God. The Southern field was presented to me, and I presented the light given me to the people. They were aroused. They set to work to raise means for that field. But where is that means now? What has become of it? It has been diverted from its rightful place. Money was raised for the special purpose, so it was stated, of helping the Southern field, and was then used for a different purpose. This reveals the great blindness and presumption on the part of responsible men. Had they been workers in the Southern field, how different would have been their treatment of this matter. But it made every difference who were the ones to be disappointed and cramped for means. I feel my heart burn with righteous indignation when men thus plan and maneuver to divert everything into lines which serve their own purposes, to make less conspicuous the gap their mismanagement has made. The principles of righteousness have been departing from the Conference. Brethren, for Christ's sake, begin to work on a right basis!",
