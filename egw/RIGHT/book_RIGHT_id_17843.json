    "word": "My brother, you are in positive danger through neglecting to carry out health reform more strictly in your own life and in your family. Bro. L-----, your blood is impure and you are farther corrupting and inflaming it by the gratification of taste. Never be betrayed into indulging in stimulants, for this will be followed not only by reaction and loss of physical strength, but with benumbed intellect. Strictly temperate habits in eating and drinking, with firm trust in God, will improve your physical, mental, and moral health. You are of a highly excitable temperament. You have but little self-control and frequently say and do things under excitement, which you afterwards regret. You should call a determined will to your aid in the warfare against your own inclinations and propensities. You need to keep the avenues of your soul open for the reception of light and truth. But when something occurs to test and prove you, prejudice frequently comes in, and you arise at once against what you deem a restriction of your liberty or an infringement upon your rights.",
