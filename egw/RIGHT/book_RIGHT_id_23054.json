    "word": "No one has any right to take advantage of the business arrangements that have been made in regard to health foods. Those who handle these foods should first come to an understanding with Dr. Kellogg or others who are working in harmony with him, and learn the best methods of handling the health foods. He who enters selfishly into this work, at the same time giving his customers the impression that the profits on the goods he sells are used for personal interest, is under the displeasure of God. By and by their business will fail, and they will get things into such a tangle that their brethren will have to buy them out to save disgrace being brought on the cause.",
