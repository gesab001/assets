    "word": "Disconnected Presentation of Truth \n\n     God would not have you think that you are impressed by His Spirit when you fly from your subject, bringing in foreign matters which are designed as a reproof, and which should not be named in connection with the words of solemn and sacred truth. By doing this, you lose your bearings, and weaken the effect of that which is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. You have made of none effect many precious ideas, by mixing them with other thoughts which have come to your mind but \n                                                                           310\nwhich had no bearing upon the subject. That which is far from the subject under consideration should find no place in your discourses.",
