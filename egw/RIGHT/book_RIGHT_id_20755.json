    "word": "MR No. 1391 - A Call to Commitment in Youth\n\n     (Written from Ashland Crossing, Iowa, June 2, 1871, to \"Dear Children\" [Edson and Emma White].) \n\n\n     We have been spending a few days at our home in Washington. It is a beautiful place. There are flowers and shrubs of almost every variety. Shade trees and fruit trees in abundance. All nature is radiant with brightness of early summer. But much as I admire this beautiful place, which is a picture of loveliness, I can hardly call it home. We have never been permitted to remain here longer than a few days at a time. Yet why should I regret this? The work of God is dearer to us than pleasant homes and beautiful scenery.",
