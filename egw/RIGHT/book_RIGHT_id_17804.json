    "word": "Christ has a right to your services. You are not your own servant, to serve your own interest, but the interest of him who has employed you. As a professed Christian, your relation to God brings you under obligations as his servant. You have become his servant by grace. It is not your own property entrusted to you for investment. Had it been so, you might have consulted your own pleasure in regard to its use. The capital is the Lord's, and you are responsible for its use or abuse. There are ways and means in which this capital can be invested--put out to the exchangers, where it shall be earning the Lord something. If it is allowed to be buried in the earth, the Lord is not benefited, and you will not be benefited; but will lose all that you had entrusted to you.",
