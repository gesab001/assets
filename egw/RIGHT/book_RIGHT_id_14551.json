    "word": "When we have an assurance which is bright and clear of our own salvation, we shall exhibit cheerfulness and joyfulness, which becomes every follower of Jesus Christ. The softening, subduing influence of the love of God, brought into practical life, will make impressions upon minds that will be a savor of life unto life. But a harsh, denunciatory spirit, if manifested, will turn many souls away from the truth into the ranks of the enemy. Solemn thought! To deal patiently with the tempted requires us to battle with self. But God has given Jesus to us, and believing on Him as our personal Saviour, all heaven is at our command. The purchased possession of Christ is around us on every hand. There is want, there is wretchedness and sin on every side. \"Freely ye have received, freely give.\" \n\n\n     \"Oh, hearts are bruised, dead, \n      And homes are bare and cold, \n      And lambs for whom the Shepherd bled, \n      Are straying from the fold. \n\n\n                .   .   .   .   . \n\n\n     \"The captives to release, \n      To God the lost to bring, \n      To teach the way of life and peace, \n      It is a Christlike thing.\"",
