    "word": "Christians are Christ\u2019s jewels. They are to shine brightly for Him, shedding forth the light of His loveliness. Their luster depends on the polishing they receive. They may choose to be polished or to remain unpolished. But everyone who is pronounced worthy of a place in the Lord\u2019s temple must submit to the polishing process. Without the polishing that the Lord gives they can reflect no more light than a common pebble.",
