    "word": "Do not endeavor to preserve your cold, un-Christlike dignity. This is not religion; it is not Christianity. What you need is the light that shines in the face of Christ to cause your faces to shine with the brightness of His love. Put away your cast-iron dignity. God has not told you to cherish any such thing. Let your hearts be filled with the love of Christ. Then Christlike sympathy will shine forth from your faces. . . .",
