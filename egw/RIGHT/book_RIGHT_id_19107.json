    "word": "Dear child, your pilgrimage is nearly ended. We will not set up our wishes and our wills, but we will let you rest in hope till the Lifegiver shall call you forth from your prison-house to a bright immortality. Jesus is \n\n\n                                    -127- \n\njust the Saviour for you now, the One whose bright presence will make, in any place, your heaven. Your life, my precious child, is hid with Christ in God, and when He who is your life shall appear, then will you also appear with Him, clothed with immortality and eternal life. Do you behold His glory in your failing strength, full of grace, mercy and peace? And do you turn to Him like the needle to the magnet?",
