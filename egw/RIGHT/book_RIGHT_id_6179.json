    "word": "The Lord is exact and infallible in His comprehension. He understands the working of the human mind, the active principles of the human agents He has formed, just how they will be moved upon by the objects that come before them, and in what manner they will act under every temptation that can try them and in every circumstance in which they are placed. \"The ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and He pondereth all his goings\" (Proverbs 5:21). \"The eyes of the Lord are in every place\" (Proverbs 15:3). \"He looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven\" (Job 28:24). \"The Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts\" (1 Chronicles 28:9). He knows the things that come into our minds, every one of them. . . . God pities the poor, self-deceived souls who are trampling upon His truth. Let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest. Pity and deplore the blindness of the minds that are under the dominion of Satan, but restrain your own wrath and passion, and do not pass your judgment upon them. Leave in God's hands the despisers of His truth. The right and liberty of passing judgment upon others is not given to you. It was not given to Moses to pronounce judgment against rebellious Israel. The glaring weakness of His agents, as displayed by Moses, will bring its reward. . . .",
