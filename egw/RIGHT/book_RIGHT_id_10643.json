    "word": "Our relations with one another should be pleasant. When we do right, the testimony of our own spirit and the testimony of the Spirit of God bear witness that the human mind is under the control of the divine mind. . . . His Word furnishes evidence from which we may draw the conclusion that we are indeed His sons and daughters. . . . True love for God carries with it true, reverential trust. And he who loves God will love his brother also.",
