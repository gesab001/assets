    "word": "\"Now, Brother Olsen, I can not, dare not, hold my peace. I shall cry aloud and spare not. But I beg of you to hold fast the hand of God, and to see and act in the light of God. We are living in the solemn scenes of this earth's history. If ever there was a time when things should be called by their right name, it is now. This is no time to call sin righteousness, and righteousness \n                                                                           18\nsin. We must lay hold by faith now. It is time for every one to be wide-awake. I may have to write still more plainly if God calls for me to do it. I shall speak, and shall not hold my peace. I am sorry, so sorry, that you have not heeded the cautions God has given you, and I fear for you that the outcome of matters will kill you. But God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. He will not have his word return unto him void, for it shall perform the thing whereto it is sent. But I beg of you rather to let things go by default than to set men to help matters in any line who are not with the work with God, soul, body, and spirit. Who can be found to take things as they are now, and set them in order? I can not see; but the Lord has men prepared for emergencies, and who will, under God, work out reforms; but it can now be only at a terrible cost and against terrible odds. I suppose you do not see the need of my writing this, but I think you will in time. I carry a heavy load, and I call on you in the name of the Lord to do your duty. I call on you at least not to encourage men to think you stand with them and sustain them, and thus give them influence.\"",
