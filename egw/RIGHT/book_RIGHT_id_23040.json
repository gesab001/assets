    "word": "\"Sunnyside\" Cooranbong, July 4, 1900 \nDear Brother and Sister Haskell: \n\n\n     I sit here in my bed, this cold July morning trying to write to you. I have woollen mits on my hands, leaving my fingers free to write. I place my lamp on one side at my left hand, rather than behind me, and then the light shines on my paper in just the right way. Sitting on the bed is the easiest position for me, and I call this my throne. It is a little past two o'clock. I continue to be an early riser, and I write every day. There has been considerable rainy weather here this winter, and this has kept me indoors.",
