    "word": "When John's disciples became jealous of Christ, they say, \"This man, Christ, is baptizing, and all men go unto him.\" And they bring it in to stir up jealousy. John tells them, \"There cometh one after me who is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose\" (See John 3:26; 1:27). Here was the very work to be done. Well, now, do you think that John had no human feelings? Of course he had! But those human feelings should not have a power over him on that occasion. No; when he sees Christ in the crowd, why he says, \"Behold the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). He directed the people right to Christ, and two of the disciples immediately followed Him.",
