    "word": "When I went to California this season, I saw the great dearth of \n\n\n                -81- \n\nlaborers that exists. Brother Gates and Brother Underwood know how hard we worked at the California camp meeting. But after all had been done that it was possible for us to do, there was not a man left after the camp meeting to bind off the work. And there was Brother [E. P.] Daniels, who needed someone to stand right by his side and tell him what to do and how to work himself out. But he was left, some considering him the worst man who ever lived, and others trying to plaster over his course as though it was not so bad after all. But nobody was left to bind off the work.",
