    "word": "Let us take our stand under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel. Those who at the coming of Christ are standing under the black banner of rebellion, can not enter into immortal life. \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\" When you are tried and tempted, remember that Jesus is your helper. He will give you grace to resist every temptation, if you will strive to walk in harmony with the precepts of God.--Ms 30, 1886, pp. 1-4. (Sermon, \"The Christian Pathway,\" November 7, 1886.)",
