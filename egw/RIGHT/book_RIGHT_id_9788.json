    "word": "I Stand Alone, Severely Alone.--I have a statement to make. When the Lord presents before me any matter and instruction and I have a message to bear concerning the said matter, then I shall, to the best of my God-given ability, make known the matter, presenting the mind and will of God just as clearly as my human capabilities, guided and controlled by the Holy Spirit, shall bring all the matter before me to present to others. In regard to the serious matters given me I have not given anyone--man or woman--any right to have the least control over my work the Lord has given me to do.",
