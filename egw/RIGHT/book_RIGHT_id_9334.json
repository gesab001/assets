    "word": "Not Narrow or Bigoted \n\n     There are many among professed Christians today who would decide that Daniel was too particular, and would pronounce him narrow and bigoted. They \n                                                                           20\nconsider the matter of eating and drinking as of too little consequence to require such a decided stand--one involving the probable sacrifice of every earthly advantage. But those who reason thus will find in the day of judgment that they turned from God's express requirements and set up their own opinion as a standard of right and wrong. They will find that what seemed to them unimportant was not so regarded of God. His requirements should be sacredly obeyed. Those who accept and obey one of His precepts because it is convenient to do so, while they reject another because its observance would require a sacrifice, lower the standard of right and by their example lead others to lightly regard the holy law of God. \"Thus saith the Lord\" is to be our rule in all things.",
