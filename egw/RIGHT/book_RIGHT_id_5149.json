    "word": "There is a great and special work to be carried on in these last days, and the work is to be carried on in right lines. The Lord would have us understand that minds that are not daily enlightened by the Holy Spirit have not wisdom even concerning the carrying forward of the business enterprises which if properly managed, would tell for the advancement of God's cause. In these days of peril we must avoid anything that has a tendency to divert the mind from the great work to be done. To gain means for the accomplishment of certain results, we may make plans that appear to be wise and just and rational, but were these plans carried out the future might show that they had accomplished little or nothing for the saving of souls.",
