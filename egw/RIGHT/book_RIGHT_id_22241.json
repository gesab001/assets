    "word": "The teachers of the people have not themselves become acquainted by living experience with the Source of their dependence and their strength. And when the Lord raises up men and sends them with the very message for this time to give to the people--a message which is not a new truth, but the very same that Paul taught, that Christ Himself taught--it is to them a strange doctrine. They begin to caution the people--who are ready to die because they have not been strengthened with the lifting up of Christ before them--\"Do not be too hasty. Better wait, and not take up with this matter until you know more about it.\" And the ministers preach the same dry theories, when the people need fresh manna. The character of Christ is an infinitely perfect character, and He must be lifted up, He must be brought prominently into view, for He is the power, the might, the sanctification and righteousness of all who believe in Him. The men who have had a Pharisaical spirit, think if they hold to the good old theories, and have no part in the message sent of God to His people, they will be in a good and safe position. So thought the Pharisees of old, and their example should warn ministers of that self-satisfied ground.",
