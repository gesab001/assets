    "word": "Ezekiel\n     Upon the banks of the river Chebar, Ezekiel beheld a whirlwind seeming to come from the north, \u201ca great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber.\u201d A number of wheels intersecting one another were moved by four living beings. High above all these \u201cwas the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.\u201d \u201cAnd there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.\u201d Ezekiel 1:4, 26; 10:8.",
