    "word": "To Awaken Faith in the Great Healer \n\n     As Christ's followers, we are to work with all rational methods to preach the gospel of present truth. Not only by words but by deeds we are to give evidence that Christ is willing to unite with His devoted ministers today in healing the sick and suffering. The Lord would revive in the minds of His workers a living faith in His power. When we increase in the faith of the gospel of Christ, and encourage that faith as it is presented in the word of God, there will be in our sanitariums not only a practical knowledge of how to treat the sick upon right principles but the manifestation of a living faith in God that will lead the workers to call upon the Great Physician for divine assistance. And the Lord will come to the help of such in response to their faith in His power.",
