From one end of the world to the other must the message of Christ's soon coming be proclaimed. The third angel's message--the last message of mercy to a perishing world --is so precious, so glorious. Let the truth go forth as a lamp that burneth. Mysteries into which angels desire to look, which prophets and kings and righteous men desired to know, the church of God is to make known.",
