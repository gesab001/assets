As Jesus asked for baptism, John drew back exclaiming, \u201cI have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?\u201d With firm yet gentle authority, Jesus answered, \u201cSuffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d And John, yielding, led the Saviour down into the Jordan, and buried Him beneath the water. \u201cAnd straightway coming up out of the water,\u201d Jesus \u201csaw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.\u201d\u2014DA 110, 111.",
