    "word": "\"WHEN I CAME HERE, THEY WERE PAYING TO AUTHORS TEN PER CENT. ROYALTY ON THE RETAIL PRICE OF BOOKS. . . . I THINK ABOUT THE FIRST CONCESSION MADE ON THAT WAS BY BROTHER SMITH. I THINK BROTHER SMITH WAS ON THE BOARD AT THAT TIME, AND I THINK HE THOUGHT TEN PER CENT. \n                                                                           32\nOF THE WHOLESALE PRICE WAS ENOUGH, AND I THINK BROTHER SMITH MADE A CONCESSION, . . . AND TOOK TEN PER CENT. ON THE WHOLESALE PRICE. . . . I DO NOT THINK THERE WAS ANY EFFORT MADE TO MAKE HIM DO IT. I THINK IT WAS VOLUNTARY ON HIS PART THAT HE DID SO. THERE HAS BEEN A FEELING FROM THAT TIME ON BY SOME PARTIES ON ACCOUNT OF THE ROYALTY ON BOOKS. SISTER WHITE FELT QUITE PUT OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME PARTIES THAT TOOK A RATHER ACTIVE PART IN DISCUSSING THE ROYALTY QUESTION; AND I SUPPOSE, PERHAPS, MAYBE, I WAS ABOUT AS ACTIVE AS ANY MAN IN THE WHOLE BUSINESS, AND CALLED ATTENTION FREQUENTLY TO THE QUESTION OF ROYALTIES; THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY HEAVY EMBARGO ON THE CANVASSERS; IN FACT SOME OF THE CANVASSERS INQUIRED WHAT ROYALTY WE PAID, AND THEY FELT LIKE IT WAS A PRETTY HEAVY EMBARGO; AND I THINK THAT QUITE LARGELY MY TROUBLE COMMENCED RIGHT THERE. I THINK THAT IS THE SEED OF THE WHOLE UPSHOT. THAT IS MY OPINION OF THE MATTER. SISTER WHITE HAS WRITTEN TO ME A GREAT MANY TIMES, AND MOST ALWAYS HAS GIVEN ME A DIG ON THAT QUESTION, AND IT HAS BEEN RANKLING IN HER MIND FOR AT LEAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS. . . . I AM SURE THAT THE SEED OF DISCORD, THE SEAT OF TROUBLE WITH ME, STARTS THERE. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD MY MIND WITH REFERENCE TO THAT, AND I HAVE IT YET. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD MY MIND IN REFERENCE TO THE JUSTICE OF THAT; . . . AND ALL SISTER WHITE EVER SAID TO ME HAS NEVER CHANGED MY MIND, AND NEVER WILL.\"  {PH146 31.10}  \n     W. C. SISLEY--WE ARE PAYING TEN PER CENT. ON TRADE BOOKS, AND FIVE PER CENT. ON SUBSCRIPTION BOOKS.",
