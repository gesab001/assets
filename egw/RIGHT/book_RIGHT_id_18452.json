    "word": "Is it not time for us to live so fully in the light of God's countenance, we who receive so many favors from Him, that we may know how to treat those less favored, not working from the world's standpoint, but from the Bible standpoint? Is it not right in this line that Christian effort is most needed? Is it not here that our influence should be brought to bear against the prevailing customs and practices of the world? Should not it be the work of the white people to elevate the standard of character among the colored race, to teach them how Christians should live, by exemplifying the spirit of Christ, showing that we are one brotherhood?--Ms 7, 1896, pp. 1, 2. (\"Colored Race,\" February 3, 1896.)",
