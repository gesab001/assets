    "word": "Children, let us as a family wash our robes of character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. We must be earnest, self-possessed, firm, decided, and persevering if we are overcomers and have on the white robe of Christ's righteousness--a fitness for the society of heavenly angels, for the mansions Jesus has gone to prepare for those who love Him. Home sweet home! Shall we not prize that rest that remaineth for the people of God? We shall see Jesus, Him whom our souls love.",
