    "word": "I have seen the cases of others who like you are neglecting their duties. I have seen many things in your case in your past experience. And when I enter a family and see a course pursued that God has reproved and condemned, I am in grief and distress, whether the special sins have been shown me or the sins of another who has neglected similar duties. I know whereof I speak, I feel deeply over the matter. I say, then, for Christ's sake make haste to come on the right ground, and harness up for the battle.--Letter 52, 1886.",
