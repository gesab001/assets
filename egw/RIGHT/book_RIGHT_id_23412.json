    "word": "A Right Choice \n\n     When the students in our schools learn to choose God's will, they will find it comparatively easy to do His will. Let every student remember that he is a member of God's firm, and that he is to make the school what God would have it. If you see defects in students or in church members, be thankful to God you have discerned these defects. Do not grieve your Redeemer by imitating them. Avoid them. You will see those who are weak in spiritual understanding, who are not learning in the school of Christ His meekness and lowliness, who manifest a vain, frivolous, worldly character, which loves display. The only remedy for these is to talk of Jesus and behold Jesus. If they can be led to look at Him, and study His character, \n                                                                           84\nthey will learn to despise everything that is vain and frivolous; for Christ was intensely earnest, full of goodness, mercy, forbearance, patience, and unexampled love. By continuing to behold Jesus, they will rise above the littleness of the things that so molded them that they were unlovely and unholy in character. They will feel contempt for themselves. They will say, \"I will not sit with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.\" \"He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.\" . . .",
