    "word": "When God has a work for men to do in connection with Jesus Christ and the heavenly intelligences, and a revelation to give to men in regard to the eternal salvation of their fellow-men, he does not select men who have not a knowledge of God and truth and his righteousness; he does not choose weak and unsuitable men for this work, for this would misrepresent the work, and cast reflection upon God's wisdom. God makes no mistakes; and he is not glorified when those who profess to follow him are heedless, and make mistakes. The God of heaven has not left us to follow impulses, or our own impulses, or any man's guesses and weaknesses \n\n\n                          -17- \n\nand perpetual mistakes, when vital, eternal interests are involved. There are things we need to know, and which we never can know, unless the Lord tells us about these things. Therefore we must call upon God to give us his wisdom. We need to have wisdom,-- something reliable and sure; we need truth without any admixture of error.",
