    "word": "We each have a character to form after the divine similitude; we have a duty to perform in maintaining strict temperance in eating and drinking and dressing. And we have the perfect pattern before us in the life of Christ. It is your privilege to study the Guidebook. With determined effort keep your thoughts toward heaven. Christ is your leader. Following Him, you will grow in knowledge of His will and way. You are bought with a price, and it is your privilege to give to others an unerring example of the charity, the love, the righteousness of Christ. He came to the world to teach all, high and low, rich and poor, how to become partakers of the divine nature. \"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" What a privilege is ours! We need faith, a living, growing faith, if we would become partakers of the divine nature, and escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. . . .",
