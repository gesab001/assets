    "word": "It is now growing daylight. We are having the first cold weather, but it is not very severe. The days have been very pleasant, and the nights clear, the full moon making them almost as bright as day. We have had a few gentle rains, but up till within a few days, the weather has not been cold. I have taken a ride daily, unless the showers threatened.",
