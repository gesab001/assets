    "word": "The first step in reconciliation to God is the conviction of sin. . . . \"By the law is the knowledge of sin\" (Romans 3:20). In order to see his guilt, the sinner must test his character by God's great standard of righteousness. It is a mirror which shows the perfection of a righteous character and enables him to discern the defects of his own. The law reveals to man his sin. . . .

He must exercise repentance toward God, whose law has been transgressed; and faith in Christ, his atoning sacrifice. . . .",
