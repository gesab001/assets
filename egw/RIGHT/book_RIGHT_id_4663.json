    "word": "The beast with two horns \u201ccauseth [commands] all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\u201d [Revelation 13:16, 17] The third angel's warning is, \u201cIf any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.\u201d \u201cThe beast\u201d mentioned in this message, whose worship is enforced by the two-horned beast, is the first, or leopard-like beast of Revelation 13,\u2014the papacy. The \u201cimage to the beast\u201d represents that form of apostate Protestantism which will be developed when the Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas. The \u201cmark of the beast\u201d still remains to be defined.",
