    "word": "The Saviour is acquainted with the mental suffering of His children. He knows how at times their hearts are wounded and bleeding. He would have the afflicted soothed and helped. He says to us, \"Bear ye one another's burdens\" (Galatians 6:2). \"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves\" (Romans 15:1). We are to relate ourselves rightly to one another, even though to do this demands sacrifice. Christ made an infinite sacrifice for us, and should we not be willing to sacrifice for others? We are to guard carefully against wounding or bruising the hearts of God's children, for when we do this, we wound and bruise the heart of Christ.--Letter 31, Jan. 17, 1904, to Elder and Mrs. J. A. Burden, and Dr. and Mrs. D. H. Kress.",
