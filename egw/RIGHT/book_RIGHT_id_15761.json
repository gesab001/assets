    "word": "You cannot depend on your own righteousness. If you make the Lord your trust constantly, you will not be brought into confusion. For keeping power, trust wholly in the One who understands all your spiritual necessities. God is very pitiful. Depend on Him alone. Christ's righteousness atones for your sins. He is making intercession in your behalf. Seek to please Him by keeping all His commandments.",
