    "word": "\"Make straight paths for your feet,\" says the apostle, \"lest that which is lame be turned out of the way.\" Hebrews 12:13. The path that leads away from God, away from His holy, perfect standard of right, is always crooked and dangerous. Yet . . . many have been walking in this path of transgression. In many cases they did not start right in childhood and youth, and they have pursued crooked paths all the way along. Not only have they erred from the right way themselves but through the influence of their example others have been turned aside from the straight, plain path, and have made fatal mistakes. . . .",
