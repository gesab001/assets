    "word": "Now, is it not best to believe on Christ? You say you do; but we can tell whether you do or not. If you do, Christ is formed within you, the hope of glory. If you have the love of God in your hearts, you will be led to sacrifice for those around you. He says, \"Love one another as I have loved you.\" \"Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of God.\" Then He says, \"The world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not.\" While in the world we are to be the \n\n\n                -51- \n\nlight of the world. We are to kindle our taper at the divine altar; it is to lay our souls before Him in surrender as did Jacob. Let His will prevail, and then you will have in your hearts a living connection with God, and you can tell of Christ to those around you. And you will do this, for you cannot hold your peace. There are many who are going to ruin all around us. Am I my brother's keeper? The truth of God, if presented in a right spirit, might save many. Carry it to them.",
