    "word": "The leader at Wolfe Lake has not the right qualification to build up and create that interest which the members of the church shall need to become laborers. There is not tact and judgment used to preserve the life and vital interest in the church. Old habits have been dragged into the church. A living connection with God would give a living, fresh experience. Old stereotyped prayers and exhortations; dry, prosy hymns and labors are not in place at all.",
