    "word": "The world is soon to be left by the angel of mercy, and the seven last plagues are to be poured out. Sin, shame, sorrow, and darkness are on every side; but God still holds out to the souls of men the precious privilege of exchanging darkness for light, error for truth, sin for righteousness. But God's patience and mercy will not always wait. Let not one soul think that he can hide from God's wrath behind a lie, for God will strip from the soul the refuge of lies. The bolts of God's wrath are soon to fall, and when He shall begin to punish the transgressors, there will be no period of respite until the end. The storm of God's wrath is gathering, and those only will stand who are sanctified through the truth in the love of God. They shall be hid with Christ in God till the desolation shall be overpast. He shall come forth to punish the inhabitants of the world for their iniquity, \n                                                                           183\nand \"the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.\" Let the language of the soul be-- \n     Hide me, O my Saviour, hide! \n      Till the storm of life is past; \n     Safe into the haven guide, \n      Oh, receive my soul at last! \n\n\n     Other refuge have I none, \n      Hangs my helpless soul on Thee; \n     Leave, oh, leave me not alone! \n      Still support and comfort me. \n\n                                               -",
