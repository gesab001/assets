    "word": "I have a thankful heart that my heavenly Father is attentive to the wants of those who seek Him. I want my mind stayed upon God. I want His Holy Spirit to rest upon me. I want to honor the Lord daily. We need a deeper sense of the grace of God. All our ministers need deep searching of heart. They need to seek the Lord in humility of soul. The work of grace carried forward intelligently reveals itself in works that are righteous.",
