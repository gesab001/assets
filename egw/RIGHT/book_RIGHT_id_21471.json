    "word": "The real laborers will be careworn, oppressed in spirit, and they will feel as did Christ when He wept over Jerusalem. When they see crookedness and impenitence, and when they see people who will not listen to the Word of the Lord, why they will feel as He felt when He exclaimed, \"O, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not\" [Matthew 23:37]. Here are precious invitations of mercy, and while we carry them and try to let the light be reflected upon the world in darkness, we cannot see, perhaps, that the rays of light are penetrating everywhere. We may not see this, but it is so, if we carry the light and have the right spirit--and we want the right spirit--and we want to labor in Christ and have Christ with us constantly.",
