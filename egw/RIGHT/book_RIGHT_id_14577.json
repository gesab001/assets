    "word": "God is well pleased if those striving for eternal life aim high. There will be strong temptations to indulge the natural traits of character by becoming worldly wise, scheming, and selfishly ambitious, gathering wealth to the neglect of the salvation which is of so much higher value. But every temptation resisted is a priceless victory gained in subduing self; it bends the powers to the service of Jesus, and increases faith, hope, patience, and forbearance. . . . Let us aim in the strength of Jesus for the crown heavy with stars. \"They that be wise shall shine as . . . the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever\" (Daniel 12:3).",
