    "word": "True science and Bible religion are in perfect harmony. Let the students in our schools learn all they possibly can. But, as a rule, let them be educated in our own institutions. Be careful how you advise them to go to other schools, where error is taught, in order to complete their education. Do not give them the impression that greater educational advantages are to be obtained by mingling with those who do not seek wisdom from God. The great men of Babylon were willing to be benefited by the instruction that God gave through Daniel, to help the king out of his difficulty by the interpretation of his dream. But they were anxious to mix in their heathen religion with that of the Hebrews. Had Daniel and his fellows consented to such a compromise, they would, in the view of the Babylonians, have been complete as statesmen, fit to be entrusted with the affairs of the kingdom. \n\n\n                                   -337- \n\nBut the four Hebrews entered into no such arrangement. They were true to God, and God upheld them and honored them. The lesson is for us. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.\"--Letter 57, 1896. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C.
