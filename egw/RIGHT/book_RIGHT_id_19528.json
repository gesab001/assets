    "word": "Travel by Train From Omaha to Oakland, 1873--Dear Children, Edson and Emma: We are seated in the cars at Omaha en route to California. We have made our transfer all right. Now we have only one more change to make before we shall reach Oakland, California. This is appreciated by us who have so great an amount of baggage. We slept excellently well last night. Your father is feeling quite well for him. He is cheerful. We have seen but little snow thus far. The weather is mild indeed for this season. In two days we shall reach the summit, then we may be sensible of a change and experience cold weather.--Letter 23, 1873, p. 1. (To Edson and Emma White, Dec. 24, 1873.)",
