    "word": "The great work of life is character building, and a knowledge of God is the foundation of all true education. . . . The law of God is a reflection of His character. Hence the psalmist says, \"All thy commandments are righteousness\"; and \"through thy precepts I get understanding.\" God has revealed Himself to us in His Word and in the works of creation. Through the volume of inspiration and the book of nature we are to obtain a knowledge of God.",
