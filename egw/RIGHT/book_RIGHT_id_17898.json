    "word": "Marcus felt deeply over the case of Richard; but he could not see how he could help him. Marcus never would have left that Office if the young men had been true to their profession. If Marcus makes shipwreck of faith, his blood will surely be found in the skirts of the young who profess Christ, but who, in their works, in their words, and deportment, state plainly that they are not of Christ, but of the world. This deplorable state of neglect, of indifference, and unfaithfulness, must cease. A thorough and permanent change must take place in the Office, or those who have had so much light and so great privileges should be dismissed, and others take their place, even if they be unbelievers. It is a fearful thing to be self-deceived. Said the angel, pointing to these in the Office, \"Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven.\" A profession is not enough. There must be a work inwrought in the soul, and carried out in the life.",
