    "word": "Children may be trained for the service of sin or for the service of righteousness. Solomon says, \"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\" Proverbs 22:6. This language is positive. The training that Solomon enjoins is to direct, educate, develop. But in order for parents to do this work, they must themselves understand the \"way\" the child should go. It is impossible for parents to give their children proper training unless they first give themselves to God, learning of the Great Teacher lessons of obedience to His will.",
