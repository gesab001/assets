    "word": "My brother, I want you ever to know that I am true and faithful. I am desirous that you shall be wholly victorious to the very close of your labors. Do not take counsel of yourself. Do not attempt to do any large thing, but walk humbly with God, and though that which you do, may appear very small in your eyes, it will be written in the books of record as a success. We must battle constantly in order to fight the good fight of faith. We can keep our souls in patient trust only as we put on Christ. A general faith is not enough. We must put on the robe of Christ's righteousness and wear it openly, bravely, decidedly, exhibiting Christ, and not expect too much of finite man, but keep looking unto Jesus, and become ravished with the perfections of his character. Then we shall individually make manifest the character of Jesus, and make it evident that we are invigorated by the truth; because it sanctifies the soul and brings into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.",
