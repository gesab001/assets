    "word": "Bro. Saxby is making a mistake in his life. He puts too high an estimate upon himself. He has not commenced to build right to make a success of life. He is building at the top, but the foundation is not laid right. The foundation must be laid under ground, and then the building can go up. He needs discipline and experience in the every-day duties of life, which the sciences will not give, or all his education will not give him physical exercise to become inured to the hardships of life.",
