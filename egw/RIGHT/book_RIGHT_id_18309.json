    "word": "I hope that none will become discouraged because I speak plainly. There is need of a great deal more faith, and all the entrusted talents must be called into action with an earnestness, a zeal, corresponding to the greatness of the truth to be presented to the people.

May the Lord come very near to you, that you may be a bright and shining light to those in darkness.",
