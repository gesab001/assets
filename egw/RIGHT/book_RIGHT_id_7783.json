    "word": "We are living amid the perils of the last days, and we are to cleanse ourselves from all defilement, and put on the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness. The work of God is to be steadily carried forward. We are to bring ourselves, body, soul, and spirit, into subjection to Christ. Unless we do this, the health of both body and soul will be endangered.",
