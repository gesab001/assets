    "word": "We are travelers, pilgrims and strangers, on earth. Let us not spend our means in gratifying desires that God would have us repress. Let us rather set a right example before those with whom we associate. Let us fitly represent our faith to others by restricting our wants. Let the churches arise as one man, and work earnestly as those who are walking in the full light of truth for these last days.",
