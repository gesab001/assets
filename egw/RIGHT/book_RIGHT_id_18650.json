    "word": "The characters of God's people are to be developed by the relation that exists between man and God, between man and his fellow man. In the Scriptures God has set forth practical lessons to govern the life and conduct of all; but though He has given minute particulars in regard to our character, conversation, and conduct, yet in a large measure, His lessons are disregarded and ignored. Besides the instruction in His word, the Lord has given special testimonies to His people, not as a new revelation, but that He may set before us the plain lessons of His Word, that errors may be corrected, that the right way may be pointed out, that every soul may be without excuse.--Letter 63, 1893, p. 3. (To Mr. P. W. B. Wessels, March 17, 1893.) \n\n\n                                   -150-",
