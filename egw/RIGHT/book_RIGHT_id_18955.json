    "word": "The enemy will come in and try to draw our minds away from the important work to be done for this time. He will seek to keep us engaged on trivial matters, make us think that it is our province to criticize and condemn others; but our work is to deal faithfully with our own souls. . . . If you keep looking at their faults, you will become like them. Instead of looking at the lives of your fellow men, look to Jesus. There you will see no imperfection, but perfection, righteousness, goodness, mercy, and truth. Take the Saviour as your example in all things. In looking to men instead of beholding Christ, you have made a great mistake.--Ms 87, 1906, pp. 1, 2. (\"And What Shall This Man Do,\" 1906.)",
