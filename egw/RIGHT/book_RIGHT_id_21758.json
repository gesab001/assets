    "word": "[Sister White:] Well, now, it has been like this. I have been sick and in pain. And I want to tell you that there is never a time when I make an appointment but that before that appointment comes, I have wrestled with the most terrible difficulty of the heart, or some infirmity, that makes it seem like an impossibility for me to go before the public. And yet, just as soon as I stand on my feet before the people, I feel just as sure that the angels of God are right by my side, as if I opened my eyes and looked upon them as I did at Christ at the time He restored me. I am taken right out of and above myself. I feel just as though, as it were, the judgment is right before me; just as though the universe of heaven is looking upon me, and as though I have these things to do, and I must say them [even] if I drop dead in the desk.",
