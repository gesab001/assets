    "word": "Evangelistic Meetings for Washington Area.-- There are places all around Washington in which  missionary effort is needed. Right in Washington itself is a small world of unconverted souls, both white and colored. Who is feeling the burden for them? And  there are many other important places yet unwarned. When I see this neglect, I feel sore at heart. I am praying night and day that the burden may be rolled onto the men who are acting as leaders in the work. Let those who are already at work, open the way for others who desire to labor, and who are qualified to take part in missionary effort. . . .",
