    "word": "Now, brethren, that is not as it ought to be. I want you to meditate over these matters. I want you to seek God in regard to it. I want you to tell the Lord to stir up these souls, that they may begin to feel that they need something more than they [have] got. Brethren, we want light, precious light from the throne of God; and in the place of quibbling, and in the place of fastening upon hooks that you can hang your doubts upon, for Christ's sake go to your knees in prayer; for Christ's sake see the error and mistake of the Jews; because Christ has said, \"Light has come, and ye choose darkness rather than light.\" [See John 3:19.] Now, this can be done right where light is shining. You meet men who say, Beware, beware; we must go careful; we must be very careful to press out the darkness, and let the light come in.",
