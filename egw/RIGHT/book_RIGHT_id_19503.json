    "word": "At the Camp Ground Between Hanford and Lemoore, California, April 23, 1880--Willie, Mary, Barbara Stickney and I left Oakland yesterday at four o'clock p.m. for Fresno. We arrived here this morning at 4:00 a.m. We feel not so bright this morning. We could not obtain berths on sleeper and had to change cars at 2:00 a.m. at Goshen. We had a pile of baggage, bedding, \n\n\n                                  -64- \n\nmattresses, satchels filled with books and baskets of provision. We shall return much lighter loaded. At Goshen we were directed to wrong cars and after getting well loaded were obliged to unload and change to cars on opposite track. We slept some in cars but my hip troubles me so that I cramped and could not sleep much.",
