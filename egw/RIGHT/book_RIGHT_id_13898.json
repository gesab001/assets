    "word": "God's messengers are commissioned to take up the very work that Christ did while on this earth. They are to give themselves to every line of ministry that He carried on. With earnestness and sincerity they are to tell men of the unsearchable riches and the immortal treasure of heaven. They are to be filled with the Holy Spirit. They are to repeat Heaven's offers of peace and pardon. They are to point to the gates of the city of God, saying: \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\" Revelation 22:14.",
