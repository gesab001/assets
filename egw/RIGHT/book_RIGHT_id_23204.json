    "word": "Sister White: If you continue as president of the Conference, that responsibility should be carried in perfect accord with your brethren. Here is one who has the chief burden of one enterprise, and another the chief burden of another enterprise. Now if one has been placed by the Lord in a position where he carries the burden of a sanitarium enterprise, it is perfectly right that you should counsel with him, but to keep agitating, all the while, the minds of your brethren, by criticizing the work that he is doing, is not right. He has his appointed work; and there are others, in other positions of responsibility, who have their appointed work, as in Bible times. The Scripture says, \"He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists.\" Thus it goes on to tell what the work of different ones is.",
