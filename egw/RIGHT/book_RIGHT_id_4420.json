    "word": "Propriety of Deportment \n\n     To those who handle sacred things comes the solemn injunction, \"Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\" [Isaiah 52:11.] Of all men, those who have been trusted and honored by the Lord, those who have been given special service to perform, should be circumspect in word and deed. They should be men of devotion, who, by works of righteousness and pure, true words, can lift their fellow-men to a higher level; men who are not unsettled by every passing temptation; men of firm, earnest purpose, whose highest aim is to gather souls to Christ.",
