    "word": "Some have said to me, \"Do you not get discouraged at times when you are under trial?\" And I have answered, \"Yes, if by discouragement you mean sad or cast down.\" \"Didn't you talk to any one of your feelings?\" \"No; there is a time for silence, a time to keep the tongue as with a bridle, and I was determined to utter no word of doubt or darkness, to bring no shade of gloom upon those with whom I was associated. I have said to myself, I will bear the Refiner's fire; I shall not be consumed. When I speak, it shall be of light; it shall be of faith and hope in God; it shall be of righteousness, of goodness, of the love of Christ my Saviour; it shall be to direct the minds of others toward heaven and heavenly things, to Christ's work in heaven for us, and our work upon earth for Him.\"",
