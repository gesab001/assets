    "word": "Prescott to Broaden His Activities (To Elder and Mrs. W. W. Prescott)--I wish to write to you in regard to your work. Let the Berrien Springs school be carried on by those who are now acquainted with it, for the Lord has been giving these men a fresh, new, and valuable experience. He has been leading them. They are working on right lines. We have need of the men who are learning how to carry these responsibilities. Brother Prescott, your place is not to be confined in any school as a manager or a teacher. Your testimony is greatly needed in our large gatherings and important meetings. \"Preach the Word; be instant in season, out of season\" to make the Word clear and distinct and powerful. . . .",
