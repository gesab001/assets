    "word": "Presidents of Conferences, I appeal to you in the name of the Lord Jesus: \"Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: \n\n\n                     - 30 - \n\nlet the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him: and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\" You are to be self-denying missionaries, men of thought, men who will pray for divine enlightenment, and who will be faithful and true to responsibilities. Sit at the feet of Jesus, and learn his will. There must be zealous activity on your part. Teach not your ideas, your plans, your notions, your maxims, but teach the word of the Lord.",
