    "word": "Helping the Inexperienced--To those upon whom God has bestowed many talents, I am instructed to say: Help the inexperienced; discourage them not.  Take them into your confidence; give them fatherly counsel, teaching them as you would teach students in a school.  Watch not for their mistakes, but recognize their \n56\nundeveloped talents, and train them to make a right use of these powers.  Instruct them with all patience, encouraging them to go forward and to do an important work.  Instead of keeping them engaged in doing things of minor importance, give them an opportunity to obtain an experience by which they may develop into trustworthy workers.  Much will thus be gained to the cause of God.",
