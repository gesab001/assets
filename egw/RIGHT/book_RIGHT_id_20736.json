    "word": "Well, the day will come when God will come to take vengeance upon those who know Him not; and we want you to be ready. We want eternal things to have some weight upon your minds. We want you to have on the robes of righteousness, that Christ will bestow His blessing upon you. And He says, \"I will lead you unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from your eyes.\" \n\n\n                                     -140- \n\nNow, my brethren and sisters, if you do have that living faith in Christ, He will give you a faith and hope that the world cannot give or take away.--Ms 35, 1885. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May 12, 1988. Entire Ms.",
