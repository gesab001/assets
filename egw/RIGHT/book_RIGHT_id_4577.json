    "word": "\u201cMost serene emperor, illustrious princes, most clement lords,\u201d said Luther, \u201cI this day appear before you in all humility, according to your command; and I implore your majesty, and your august highnesses, by the mercies of God, to listen with favor to the defense of a cause which I am well assured is just and right. If in my reply I do not use the just ceremonial of a court, pardon me, for I am not familiar with its usages. I am but a poor monk, a child of the cell, and I have labored only for the glory of God.\u201d",
