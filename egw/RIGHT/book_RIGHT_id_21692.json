    "word": "In the place of being jealous, and thinking that your own ways are right in the sight of God, you should be jealous for your brother's feelings. Now, if everyone will make straight paths for his own feet to travel in, then he will be able to help his brother. We should take heed to our ways and draw nigh to God day by day. If we have the spirit of prayer, then we shall press our petition to the throne of grace, and if we pray more and search the Scriptures with far greater diligence, we will not be denied the blessing God has promised to bestow. We will not then be jealous of one another. God has not set any of you upon the track of your brother, to find fault with him. Keep your own feet in the straight path, and then you will by your example encourage your brother.",
