    "word": "There is need of an education in regard to the rights and duties of men in authority who have lorded it over God's heritage.  When a man is placed in a position of trust, who knows not what kind of spirit he should exercise in dealing with human minds, he needs to learn the very first principles as to his authority over his fellow-men.  Right principles must be brought into the heart, and wrought into the warp and woof of character.--Letter 83, 1896 (May 22, 1896 to O. A. Olsen).",
