    "word": "This important matter was not left with Isaac, for him to select for himself, independent of his father. Abraham tells his servant that God will send his angel before him to direct him in his choice. The servant, to whom this mission was entrusted, started on his long journey. As he entered the city, where Abraham's kindred dwelt, he prayed earnestly to God to direct him in his choice of a wife for Isaac.

And it came to pass, that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshiped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth.\"",
