I do not want you by any wrong course that you may pursue, to hedge up the way which will deter you from doing the work the Lord has for you to do. My brother, there is only one safe course for you, and that is for you to make straight paths for your feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way. Sound doctrine must be brought into actual contact with men's souls, that it will produce sound practice. God gives sufficient light to guide every man that he shall perform right actions. But unless this light is appreciated and obeyed, he will be left in the condition of Chorazin and Bethsaida of old. It is not enough to believe the truth, but its sanctifying power must be felt in our life and character.",
