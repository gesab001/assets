    "word": "Let the soul look to Jesus. \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). No one will be forced to look to Christ; but the voice of invitation is sounding in yearning entreaty, \"Look and live.\" In looking to Christ, we shall see that His love is without a parallel, that He has taken the place of the guilty sinner, and has imputed unto him His spotless righteousness.",
