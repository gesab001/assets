Belden and wife\n\n                                                         B-9-1893 \n                                 Banks Terrace, Wellington, New Zealand, \n\nMr. and Mrs. Frank Belden, \n\nDear Nephew and Niece,- \n     I have read your letter with deep interest hoping to catch the vibration of the right ring in it; but if it is there I do not discern it. I am much concerned in regard to your spiritual condition. For several years you have not been walking in the light. I have had much concern for you, but when I learned by experience my words had not much weight with you I felt sorry indeed, but could do nothing to change the course of things.",
