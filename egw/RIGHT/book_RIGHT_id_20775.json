    "word": "In praying for the sick, it is essential to have faith, for it is in accordance with the Word of God. \"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\" So we cannot discard praying for the sick, and we would feel very sad if we could not have the privilege of approaching God, to lay before Him all our weakness and all our infirmities, to tell the compassionate Saviour all about these things, believing that He hears our petitions.",
