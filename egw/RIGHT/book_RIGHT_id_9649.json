CANRIGHT\nMAY BE FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING:\n\n     TESTIMONIES, VOL. 3, PP. 304-329, AUGUST 12, 1873, TO A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE; VOL. 5, PP. 516-520, ABOUT 1886, SUITABLE READING FOR CHILDREN; VOL. 5, PP. 571-573, 1887, AN IMPRESSIVE DREAM; VOL. 5, PP. 621-628, APRIL 20, 1887, A LETTER.] \n\nDear Brother: \n\n\n     I was made sad to hear of your decision, but I have had reason to expect it. It is a time when God is testing and proving His people. Everything that can be shaken will be shaken. Only those will stand whose souls are riveted to the eternal Rock. Those who lean to their own understanding, those who are not constantly abiding in Christ, will be subject to just such changes as this. If your faith has been grounded in man, we may then expect just such results.",
