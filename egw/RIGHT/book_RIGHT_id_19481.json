    "word": "One man is not to step out of his place to do something that the Lord has plainly stated He has given to another man to do. To every man is given his work. And if all will attend to their individual duties, looking to Jesus and seeking counsel of Him, they will be guided aright. And they \n\n\n                                    -356- \n\nwill have that confidence in their brethren which they desire their brethren to have in them. But he who would uproot a man in order to carry out his own ideas is doing a work that God has not given him.--Letter 49, 1903, pp. 1, 2 (April 12, 1903).",
