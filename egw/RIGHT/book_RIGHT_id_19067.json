    "word": "As Brother Belden, my secretary, and myself were returning from the Ashfield campground to our home in Granville, we saw a large herd of cattle \n\n\n                                    -422- \n\nin the road ahead of us. One animal, an enormous ox, was standing, sullen and defiant, in the middle of the street in advance of the herd. A man on horse back, having in his hand a danger signal, halted near this animal's head, and called out to Brother Belden, \"Keep to the right, and drive as quickly as possible, and he may not make a charge.\" We followed directions, and went on our way safely. This poor beast had traveled, oppressed with heat and thirst, until his nature was wrought up to a determined resistance to the will of man, and he had become unmanageable. So it was necessary for a signal flag of danger to be constantly exhibited, as a warning to the people, lest the beast should make a charge upon travelers. In the same herd some animals had been wounded; some were limping along. One poor suffering creature had both horns broken off close to his head, and the blood was flowing from the wound. Some were very lame, and were pictures of brute misery. Taken from the green paddocks, and traveling for weary miles over the hot, dusty road, these poor creatures are driven to their death, that human beings may feast on their miserable dead carcasses.",
