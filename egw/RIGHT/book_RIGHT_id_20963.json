We visited the berry patch. Could gather but six quarts. The rain drove us home. It was raining nearly all day. Willie and myself rode to Black Hawk. It rained hard, but we did not take cold. We had a very pleasant ride home. No rain. We had a good long letter from Elder Loughborough, and one from Brother Canright and Butler.",
