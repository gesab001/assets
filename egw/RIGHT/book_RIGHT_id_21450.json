    "word": "The lawyer came to Christ and asked Him, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" [Luke 10:25]. This was a positive question, and was just as decidedly answered. \"What is written in the law? How readest Thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself. And He said unto him, Thou hast answered right; this \n\n\n                                     -30- \n\ndo, and thou shalt live\" [verses 26-28]. This means to keep the first four commandments, which show the duty of man to his God, and the last six which show the duty of man to his fellowmen.",
