    "word": "The president of the National Religious Liberty Association bore a clear testimony. He said that the night before, a number of brethren had met in his room at the Review Office, and there discussed the very matters just referred to by Mrs. White. Their deliberations had continued till after one o'clock in the morning. He said he would not undertake to describe the meeting. That was unnecessary, because the description as given by Mrs. White was correct, and more exact than he could give it. He freely acknowledged that the position he had held was not right, and that he could now see his error.",
