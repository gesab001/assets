    "word": "I will now come right to the point. You do not understand me. When I spoke of your petering out, I had reference to the impression which would be made upon others if you should at this point close up the school at Battle Creek. If this change were made now, if the school in Battle Creek were closed and the buildings sold, it would have the appearance that you were compelled to make this move. Have faith in God. He gave me the idea of giving \"Christ's Object Lessons\" for the relief of the schools. He is testing His people and institutions in this thing, to see if they will work together and be of one mind in self-denial and self-sacrifice. Carry forward this work without flinching in the name of the Lord. Let God's plan be vindicated. Let His proposition be fully carried out and heartily endorsed as the means of uniting the members of the churches in self-sacrificing effort. Thus they will be sanctified, soul, body, and spirit, as vessels unto honor, to whom God can impart His Holy Spirit. By this means they will accomplish the work God designs to have done.",
