    "word": "The ensign of the reign of Messiah in all its character, is to be distinguished by the likeness of the Son of man. Where the kingdom of God prevails, every carnal weapon, every influence of force and compulsion, is banished. By the action of the Holy Spirit on the mind, God is recognized with gratitude and with love that is without one taint of selfishness. Christ said, \"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them.\" \"And He is our sanctification, our sufficiency, our righteousness.\"",
