    "word": "Not until the personal advent of Christ can his people receive the kingdom. The Saviour said: \u201cWhen the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory; and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats; and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\u201d [Matthew 25:31-34.] We have seen by the scriptures just given that when the Son of man comes, the dead are raised incorruptible, and the living are changed. By this great change they are prepared to receive the kingdom; for Paul says, \u201cFlesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\u201d [1 Corinthians 15:50.] Man in his present state is mortal, corruptible; but the kingdom of God will be incorruptible, enduring forever. Therefore man in his present state cannot enter into the kingdom of God. But \n323\nwhen Jesus comes, he confers immortality upon his people; and then he calls them to inherit the kingdom, of which they have hitherto been only heirs.",
