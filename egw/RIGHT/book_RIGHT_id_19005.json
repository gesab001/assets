    "word": "I have not been able to step on my right foot at all. I use crutches. Dr. Kellogg came Tuesday morning and told me I had a very bad ankle. The ligaments were torn loose from the ankle, which swung the heel round out of place. He said I would not be able to use it at all for six weeks and perhaps not for two months. He fears it will always be weak in spite of everything they can do. He put it in splints but I was so nervous I could not keep them \n\n\n                                    -231- \n\non through the night. Last night succeeded better. He did not bring the heel fully in place. Tonight he has brought it nearer in place. It is quite painful.--Letter 1a, 1881, p. 1. (To Willie and Mary White, January 6, 1881.)",
