OF HIS ANCIENT PEOPLE, IT IS WRITTEN: \"THE LORD TESTIFIED AGAINST ISRAEL, AND AGAINST JUDAH, BY ALL THE PROPHETS, AND BY ALL THE SEERS, SAYING, TURN YE FROM\n248\nYOUR EVIL WAYS, AND KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND MY STATUTES, ACCORDING TO ALL THE LAW WHICH I COMMANDED YOUR FATHERS, AND WHICH I SENT TO YOU BY MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS.\" 2 KINGS 17:13.",
