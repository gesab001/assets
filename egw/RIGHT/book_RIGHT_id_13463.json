    "word": "Ministerial Institutes \n\n     \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,\" is the Saviour's command to His workers. But this plain direction has been disregarded. Though the light has been given again and again, men have been called from their fields of labor to spend weeks in attending a ministerial institute. There was a time when this was necessary, because our own people opposed the work of God by refusing the light on the righteousness of Christ by faith. This they should have received and should have imparted with heart and voice and pen, for it is their only efficiency. They should have labored under the Holy Spirit's direction to give the light to others. \n\n                                               -",
