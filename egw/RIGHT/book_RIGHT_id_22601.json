    "word": "The language of the heart and lips would be, as expressed by the Psalmist: \"How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. Yes, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest \n                                                                           1100\nfor herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God. Blessed are they that dwell in thine house: they will be still praising thee. Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are the ways of them. Who passeth through the valley of Baca make it a well. ... They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. ... Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God (margin, I would choose rather to sit at the threshold), than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. For the Lord God is a Sun and a shield, the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will be withheld from them that walk uprightly. O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.\"",
