    "word": "Until recently our people have made but little or no effort to help these. Christ came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. He would have every soul regard the efficacy of His blood as of unlimited value, able to save unto the uttermost all who will be persuaded to come to Him. He would have every individual of our race, formed in His image, remember that God is infinite, and that His love revealed in the atonement of Christ, in favor of all mankind, makes manifest the value He places on humanity. He bids them come to Him and be saved. To the Source of all our mercies we must come. He will use men as His agents to win their fellow men from sin.--Letter 33, 1898.",
