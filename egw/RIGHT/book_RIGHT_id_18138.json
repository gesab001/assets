    "word": "Interview on Removing Meat from the Sanitarium Tables \n\n\n     Sister White: We should become more acquainted with the outside element, and educate, and present health principles to the people, so that they will know what to expect when they get here. I felt very desirous that those who came in here should see reform right through, and I think it will come around. I think that when there is the least patronage, that is the best time to make a change in the matter of serving meat to patients on the dining room tables; and yet I cannot say there should never be any meat served. I cannot say that. But meat should not be served in the dining room. In Australia, Dr._____ and Dr. _____ were called in to advise with me as to whether they should allow meat to be served on the dining room tables of the medical institutions. I said, \"Not a particle of meat is to be served on the tables.\" I desired to have them understand this. Well, they have had the most wonderful success in the recovery of the sick, that I have seen in any institution in my life. But not a particle of meat is served in the dining room.",
