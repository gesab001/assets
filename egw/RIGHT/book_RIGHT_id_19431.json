    "word": "The Scriptures state that both Jesus and His disciples were called to this marriage feast. Christ has given Christians no sanction to say, when \n\n\n                                   -199- \n\ninvited to a marriage, \"We ought not to be present on so joyous an occasion.\" By attending this feast Christ taught that He would have us rejoice with those who do rejoice in the observance of His statutes. He never discouraged the innocent festivities of mankind when carried on in accordance with the laws of heaven. A gathering that Christ honored by His presence, it is right that His followers should attend. After attending this feast, Christ attended many others, sanctifying them by His presence and instruction.",
