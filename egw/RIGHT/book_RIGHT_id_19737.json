    "word": "Those persons who have been so officious need to become acquainted with the dear Saviour. He is the eternal and universal guardian of justice. You can never exclude Him from any matter in which the rights of His offspring are concerned. He takes the part of His children against all who would wrong them. His hand is spread over them as a buckler. No man or woman can wound them without smiting that hand.",
