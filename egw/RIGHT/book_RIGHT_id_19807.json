    "word": "In His life Christ fulfilled every specification of the law. Did He do this that from henceforth the law might be made void and that sinful beings might be given what Satan claimed to be their privilege--freedom from law? Has the enemy of God obtained in this world what he was refused in heaven? No. Christ declared, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill\" [Matthew 5:17]. Righteousness was leagued with truth to make unrighteousness appear.",
