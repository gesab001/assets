    "word": "By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified. There is no power in law to save the transgressor of law. If man, after his transgression, could have been saved by his utmost energy to keep the law, then Jesus need not have died. Man could have stood on his own merits and said, \"I am sinless.\" God will never bring down the law to man's standard, and man can never lift himself up to answer to its claims of perfection. But Christ comes to our world and pays the sinner's debt, suffers the penalty for transgression of the law, and satisfies justice, and now the sinner may claim the righteousness of Christ. \"Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound\" (Romans 5:20). \n\n\n                                   -235-",
