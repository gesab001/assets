    "word": "Sister Smith has trusted too much in man. She has thought if she had not the confidence of those whom she believed God was leading, she could not have the favor of God, and she gave up the conflict. She should have tried to press to the right, regardless of her feelings, and act from principle. She had a work before her to redeem the past. Whatever part others had acted, this did not excuse her from doing her duty, to counteract her past course of unbelief, murmuring, and rebellion.",
