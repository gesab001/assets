    "word": "Advancement in true education does not harmonize with selfishness. True knowledge comes from God and returns to God. His children are to receive that they may give again. Those who through the grace of God have received intellectual and spiritual benefits, are to draw others with them as they advance to a higher excellence. And this work, done to promote the good of others, will have the co-operation of unseen agencies. As we faithfully continue the work, we shall have high aspirations for righteousness, holiness, and a perfect knowledge of God. In this life we become complete in Christ, and our increased capabilities we shall take with us to the courts above.",
