    "word": "You have no friends or relatives that are too dear to sacrifice or leave for God, to obey or follow Him. If you love them more than Jesus, you are not worthy of Him, and will have no part with Jesus. Here is a sacrifice to make right here. The heart will govern the mind. Have your heart right and consecrated, and there will be no trouble with your will. I speak plainly. I look upon you as in the greatest danger. I want to save you. I beg of you to submit to God. There is no more required of you than is required of every Christian. Will you obey the requirements? Will you submit to God?",
