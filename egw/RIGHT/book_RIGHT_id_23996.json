    "word": "All through the book, \"The Living Temple,\" passages of scripture are used, but in many instances these passages are used in such a way that the right interpretation is not given them. The message for this time is not, \"The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are we.\" Whom does the Lord receive as vessels unto honor? Those who cooperate with Christ, those who believe the truth, who live the truth, who proclaim the truth in all its bearings.",
