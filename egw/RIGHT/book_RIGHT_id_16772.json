Each one to whom a copy of the special number is given, is to be asked for a donation to our mission funds. Each can give what he likes; but few will care to give less than twenty-five cents. Some will wish to give much more. The business firms with whom people have traded for many years will often give liberally. The rich, if \n\n\n                   -12- \n\napproached in the right manner, will often donate without stint.",
