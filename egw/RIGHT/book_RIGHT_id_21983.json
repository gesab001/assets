    "word": "In some instances men have been turned away from the truth to listen to fables. Efforts have been made to set right those thus deceived; but some had drunk so deeply from the polluted fountain, and had become so impregnated with false impressions that it was impossible to undeceive them. They had come to believe that it is more profitable to eat of the food offered in the strange doctrines presented than to eat of the food contained in the word of God.",
