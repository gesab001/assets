    "word": "Those who are one with Christ have the mind of Christ, and work the works of Christ. They are ever improving, ever drawing nearer to God, ever uplifting the soul to Jesus. By beholding the world's Redeemer, they become changed into his image. A new spiritual life is created, a new motive-power supplied. When one is fully emptied of self, when every false god is cast out of the soul, the vacuum is supplied by the inflowing of the Spirit of Christ. Such a one has the faith which works by love and purifies the soul from every moral and spiritual defilement. The Holy Spirit, the Comforter, can work upon the heart, influencing, directing, so that he enjoys spiritual things. He is \"after the Spirit,\" and he minds the things of the Spirit. He has no confidence in self; Christ is all in all. Truth is constantly being unfolded by the Holy Spirit; he receives with meekness the engrafted Word, and he gives the Lord all the glory, saying. \"God has revealed them to us by his Spirit.\" \"Now we have \n\n\n                        - 23 - \n\nreceived, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God.\" The Spirit that reveals, also works in him the fruits of righteousness. Christ is in him, \"a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.\" He is a branch of the True Vine, and bears rich clusters of fruit to the glory of God. What is the character of the fruit borne?--\"The fruit of the Spirit is love.\" Mark the words,--love, not hatred; it is joy, not discontent and mourning; peace, not irritation, anxiety, and manufactured trials. It is \"long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; against such there is no law.\"",
