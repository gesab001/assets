    "word": "Do not dishonor God by words of repining, but praise Him with heart and soul and voice.  Look on the bright side of everything.  Do not bring a cloud or shadow into your home.  Praise Him who is the light of your countenance and your God.  Do this, and see how smoothly everything will go.  -- 2SM 266, 267.",
