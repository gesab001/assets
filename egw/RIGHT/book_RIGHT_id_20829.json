    "word": "Says the apostle, \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are (through the baptismal vows) dead (to the world, dead to its customs, its ambition, its pride, its pursuits), and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory: (Colossians 3:1-4).",
