    "word": "Every Christian needs to be guarded in his expression of opinion. One thing he may settle forever. True prosperity can never come to the soul that is constantly aspiring to get higher wages, and who yields to the temptation that leads him away from the work that God has appointed him. There never can be prosperity for any man, or any family, or any firm or institution, unless the wisdom of God presides. Every right effort should be made to know what we are voicing. We must know whether it is the mind of the Lord, or the suggestions of minds controlled by the stealthy foe of righteousness. Now, just now, every right effort should be made \n\n\n                        -5- \n\nto bring the minds of men under the influence and power of truth, that our work, our merchandise and hire, shall be holiness unto the Lord. The workmen may rank themselves as doing worldly business, when they are doing the very work that will call out questions. If they are of the right spirit, they will be able to speak a word in season. Thus it may be said of our workers, our artisans, as it was said of those of old, of whom we read, \"I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.\"",
