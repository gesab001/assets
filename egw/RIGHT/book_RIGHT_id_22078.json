    "word": "Brother Geymet, the Brother from Italy, and Brother Conradi should both have received letters from me, but I have not written to them.

Is this doing as God would have us do? Should we not guard the interests of one another, and live out the truth? And when you see someone doing wrong, in the place of going to others and thus strengthening him in the wrong way, why not go right to him in the meekness of Christ and tell him what it is to be a Christian? Now we are to labor as those who have to give an account.",
