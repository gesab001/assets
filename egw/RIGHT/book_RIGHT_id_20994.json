    "word": "Christ came to our world to manifest God to men, to lead men to God. \"I am the light of the world,\" He declared. What was it that consecrated Him the light of the world? It was this. He came down from heaven. He is the true Teacher sent from God. He was the One chosen to reveal God's character to the world. He is the Bright and Morning Star. He is the Sun of Righteousness, a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of His people Israel. John declared of Him, \"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"",
