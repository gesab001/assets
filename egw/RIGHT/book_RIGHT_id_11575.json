    "word": "Brethren have engaged in patent rights, and other enterprises, and have induced others to interest themselves, who could not bear the perplexity and care of such business. Their anxiety and over-taxed minds seriously affect their already diseased bodies, and they then become desponding, which increases to despair. They lose all confidence in themselves, and think God has forsaken them, and they dare not believe that God will be merciful to them. These poor souls will not be left to the control of Satan; they will make their way through the gloom, and their trembling faith will again fasten upon the promises of God, and he will \n                                                                           95\ndeliver them, and turn their sorrow and mourning into peace and gladness. But such, I was shown, must learn by the things they suffer, to let patent rights and these various enterprises alone. They should not suffer even their brethren to flatter them to entangle themselves with any such enterprise, for their anticipations will not be realized, and then they are thrown upon the enemy's battle-field unarmed for the conflict. Means, which it was shown me should be put into the treasury of God to advance his cause, is worse than lost by being invested in some of these modern improvements. Those who profess the truth, and feel at liberty to engage, and capable of engaging, in these patent rights and inventions, should not go among their brethren and make that their field of operation, but go among unbelievers. Let not your name and profession as an Adventist, decoy your brethren who wish to consecrate their means to God. But go out into the world, and let that class invest their means who care not for the advancement of the cause of God.",
