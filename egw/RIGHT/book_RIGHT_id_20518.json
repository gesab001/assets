    "word": "It is not right to leave persons unacknowledged who are doing a good work because they do not work just exactly in accordance with other men's ideas. It is not right for men to fold their hands in quietude, and see injustice done to any in the Lord's work. There is an open field for industry in cultivating the talents lent by God for the accomplishment of His work. Those whom men call strong are not to be allowed to oppress in the least a brother who is thought not to have the merits of the stronger. God says of those who are pushed and crowded, \"If they cry unto Me in their distress, I will hear their cry, and deliver them.\" There is no reward for cowardice, no reward for oppression, for partiality in God's service.",
