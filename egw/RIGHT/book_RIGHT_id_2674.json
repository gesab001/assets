    "word": "Exercise  Makes Sleep Sweeter, Steps Livelier.--Females neglect to exercise their limbs in walking. Riding cannot take the place of walking. Many who are very feeble can walk if they only think so. They have not the disposition, and you will hear them plead, \"Oh! I cannot walk. It puts me out of breath; I have a pain in my side, a pain in my back.\"  Dear sisters, I wish you did not have these infirmities. But I know that yielding to them, and giving up to an inactive life, will not free you from them. Try to exercise moderately at first. Have rules to govern you. Walk! Yes, walk! If you possibly can, walk!  Try it a short distance at first, you who think walking is impossible. You will no doubt become weary. Your side may ache, your back give you pain, but this should not frighten you. Your limbs may feel weak. And no wonder when you have not used them much more than as if you had no limbs. . . .",
