    "word": "Intoxicating Wine\nThe wine that Christ made from water at the marriage feast of Cana was the pure juice of the grape. This is the \"new wine found in the cluster,\" of which the Scripture says, \"Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it.\" Isaiah 65:8.\n\"Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: \nAnd whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.\" \n\"Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? \nwho hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? \nWho hath redness of eyes? \nThey that tarry long at the wine; \nThey that go to seek mixed wine. \nLook not thou upon the wine when it is red, \nWhen it giveth his color in the cup, \nWhen it moveth itself aright. \nAt the last it biteth like a serpent, \nAnd stingeth like an adder.\" \n\u2014Proverbs 20:1;  23:29-32.",
