    "word": "It was no easier for Enoch to live a righteous life in his day than it is for us at the present time. The world in Enoch\u2019s time was no more favorable to a growth in grace and holiness than it is now, but Enoch devoted time to prayer and communion with God, and this enabled him to escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. It was his devotion to God that fitted him for translation.",
