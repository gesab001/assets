What shall we do? Put away the iron that is \n\n\n                                   -58- \n\nin your souls--these satanic attributes that bear such fruit--whatever it may cost you--even if it costs you your right arm, as Christ said when talking to His disciples. \"At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus\" to be converted--they were following Christ, learning of Christ. \"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 18:1, 3).
