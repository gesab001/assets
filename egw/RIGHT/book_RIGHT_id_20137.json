    "word": "Brother Canright would frequently sit reading, and make no effort to quiet the child. Sister Canright would hear her child fret and cry a passionate cry, and appear as indifferent as though she were chiseled out of marble. I have no hesitancy in saying this is wrong management and a wrong example to give to mothers. Ministers who have children that cannot be controlled, or that they do not choose to inconvenience themselves to train except spasmodically, should have a home and keep their children in it, and not annoy others and injure their own influence.",
