    "word": "Moss, Norway, [Friday] June 17, 1887. I arise early at three o'clock. The sun is shining brightly in at my windows today. We part with our brethren from the British Mission and from those who are on their way to Africa to become missionaries to that distant field. Attended morning meeting. Spoke a short time upon the advisability of Brother Starr's coming to Europe. Visited the owner of the grounds, Mr. Erikson, and his family. Had but a short time to remain but it was a pleasant interview. He kindly and generously proposed to let the governess of his children, who was an adopted daughter, take his horse and carriage and drive us over the island to see the important points of interest. We then returned and bade our brethren missionaries goodbye, thinking we might never meet again in this world those going to the distant field of Africa. May God go with them is our earnest prayer. . . .",
