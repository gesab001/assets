Jones should attend our large camp meetings and give to our people, and to outsiders as well, the precious subject of faith and the righteousness \n\n\n                                   -256- \n\nof Christ. There is a flood of light in this subject, and if he goes to the canvassers' meetings only, how can the light come before the largest number? You cannot expect that any of the canvassers can present this matter in the light in which he presents it. I think that it is robbing the churches of the light and the message for the present time for him not to attend the camp meetings.--Letter 1, 1889, p. 6.",
