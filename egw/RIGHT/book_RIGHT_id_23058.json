    "word": "IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FOOD STORES, ONE MAN HAS GONE OUT AND OPENED THE STORES, AND ALL HAVE BEEN MANAGED ON A UNIFORM PLAN. WE HAVE BEEN THINKING OF LETTING THE SAME COMPANY UNDERTAKE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SMALL RESTAURANTS. IT COULD HAVE A NUMBER OF THEM. IF THEY GREW TOO LARGE TO BE OPERATED TO ADVANTAGE IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOOD STORES, THEN ANOTHER PLACE COULD BE FOUND. WE HAVE THOUGHT THAT AS YOU SAID WE SHOULD BEGIN SMALL AND LET THINGS GROW, PERHAPS IT WOULD BE IN HARMONY WITH RIGHT PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW THIS PLAN IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESTAURANTS.",
