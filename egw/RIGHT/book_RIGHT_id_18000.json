    "word": "The Reward of Those Who Work in These \n             Hard Places \n\n\n     To those who are connected with our various school enterprises in the South, I would say: Let not a single hand be laid upon you to say, \"You cannot do this work; you must not spend your time in this way.\" Time! It is God's time, and we have a right to work for the needy and the distressed, and especially for the colored people. If we continue to labor in faith and humility, God will reveal that his righteousness goes before us, and the glory of the Lord will be our rearward. As we try to follow on to know the Lord, we shall learn that his going forth is prepared as the morning. You have been gaining an understanding of this, have you not, since you have been here?",
