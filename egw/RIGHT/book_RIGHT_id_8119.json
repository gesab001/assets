    "word": "Do not clothe yourself in Christ's righteousness, and trample underfoot His rule of right.--That law flashes conviction on every side. Sinners desire to be freed from it, and many who call themselves Christians clothe their sinful, hypocritical souls in the garments of Christ's righteousness, and trample under their feet God's great rule of right. The worship offered to God by this class is similar to Balaam's offering in behalf of Balak. They are equally offensive to God.--ST Dec. 2, 1880.",
