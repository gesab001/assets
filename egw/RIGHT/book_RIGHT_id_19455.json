    "word": "God's Truth May Be No Truth to One Who Claims to Believe It--\"Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting\" (Psalm 139:23, \n\n\n                                   -283- \n\n24). We can see how necessary it is that there should be a union of the human and the divine. All the heart is to be enlisted in the conflict. The law of God is to be written in the heart, or the soul will never obey the truth: for the truth of God may be no truth to one who even may claim to believe it. Persons may profess to love the Saviour, and yet make it manifest that love does not actuate them in His service. Why is it that the love of Christ does not wield a constraining power over the life? It is because it has never been brought into the sanctuary of the soul; it has never been made the principle of action. \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness: and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\" (Romans 10:10).",
