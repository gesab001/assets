    "word": "The word of God is to stand as the highest educating book in our world, and is to be treated with reverential awe. It is our GUIDE BOOK; we shall receive from it the truth. We need to present the Bible as the great lesson book, to place it in the hands of our children and youth, \n\n\n                     -22- \n\nthat they may know Christ, whom to know aright is life eternal. It is the book to be studied by those of middle age and those who are aged.-- Sp. Test., p. 233.",
