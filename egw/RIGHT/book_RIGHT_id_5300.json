    "word": "About thirty miles west of Turin we left the vast plains which \u201cstretch like a garden for two hundred miles along the foot of the Alps,\u201d and, passing through a narrow opening in a low range of mountains, entered the Piedmont valleys. Only one of these valleys, that of Lucerne, is traversed by the railroad. Soon after entering this valley, several others spread out like a fan, \n231\nsome at our right and some at our left. But it is in this central and largest valley, at the terminus of the railroad, that Torre Pellice is situated, and thither our course is directed, that, if  possible, we may encourage the little company there who are striving under great difficulties to obey God. We reached this place Friday, about 9 A. M., and were welcomed to the hospitable home of Eld. A.C. Bourdeau, who, according to the vote of the last European Council, had just located here with his family.",
