    "word": "The word of God plainly presents this \n                                                                           24\ntruth before us; that our physical nature will be brought into warfare with the spiritual. The apostle charges us to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul. Every perverted appetite becomes a warring lust. Appetite indulged to the injury of physical strength causes disease of the soul. The lust which the apostle mentions is not confined to the violation of the seventh commandment, but every indulgence of the taste which lessens physical vigor is a warring lust. The apostle declares that he who would gain special victories and make higher attainments in righteousness, must be \"temperate in all things.\" Temperance in eating and drinking at our tables as well as the exercise of temperance in every other respect is essential if we would overcome as Christ overcame. God has given us light not to be treated indifferently, but to be our guide and help.",
