    "word": "My brother and sister, if you would be a savor of life unto life, it is essential that a change be made in your experience and in the experience of your child. Sister McCullagh's management in the home has not pleased the Lord; your daughter has not had proper training; she has not been brought up with the careful restraint that God requires. In the home and in the world the Lord God must occupy the first place. God must be enthroned in each heart. Every rival influence, be it husband, wife, or child, which would take the homage which rightly belongs to Him, must be given up. There must be no mismanagement on the part of the mother in the training of the child, for this example will do injury to other mothers and children. \n\n\n                                   -51-",
