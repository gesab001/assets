Often this is enjoined upon believers in language that seems authoritative, because there is no other way to save men than to cut them away from their life of selfishness. Christ gave, in His life on earth, a true representation of the power of the gospel. . . . To every soul who will suffer with Him in resistance of sin, in \n                                                                           26\nlabor for His cause, in self-denial for the good of others, He promises a part in the eternal reward of the righteous.  Through the exercise of the spirit that characterized His lifework, we are to become partakers of His nature. Partaking in this life of sacrifice for the sake of others, we shall share with Him in the life to come the \"far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\"--R. & H., Sept. 28, 1911.",
