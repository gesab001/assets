    "word": "Elder Haskell, will you look away from your own merits? Will you trust the merits and righteousness of Christ? Will you look to Him and trust in Him as a loving and mighty Saviour? Will you believe just now? Will you fall all broken upon Jesus and say, \"He saveth me; I am wholly without reserve the Lord's\"? O,! look and live! The Lord has blessings for you. He will help you. \"A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench: He shall bring forth judgment unto truth\" [Isaiah 42:3].",
