    "word": "In order for man to obtain eternal life, divine power must unite with human effort, and this power Christ came to place within our reach. He says, \"Without me ye can do nothing\" (John 15:5). And He says again, \"If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it\" (John 14:14). We have a right to lay hold of the arm of infinite power. When Christ came to the world, all heaven was poured out in this one great gift. God Himself came to us in Christ. \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?\" Christ said. \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?\" (John 14:9).",
