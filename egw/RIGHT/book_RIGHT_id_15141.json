    "word": "Those who humbly and prayerfully search the Scriptures, to know and to do God\u2019s will, will not be in doubt of their obligations to God. For \u201cif any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine\u201d (John 7:17). If you would know the mystery of godliness, you must follow the plain word of truth\u2014feeling or no feeling, emotion or no emotion. Obedience must be rendered from a sense of principle, and the right must be pursued under all circumstances. This is the character that is elected of God unto salvation.",
