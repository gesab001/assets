    "word": "Dec. 17. I rise at a quarter after two o'clock. I could not complete that which I commenced several days ago. The Lord is working for His people in Stanmore. Brother Sharp lost a situation in a prosperous firm, where he has worked for fourteen years. During all that time no fault was found with him. When Brother Sharp told one of the partners of his decision to keep the Sabbath, he said they could work it all right, and was disposed to give him the day. It is the custom to work only three hours on Saturday, but Brother Sharp promised to make up that time fully by working over hours.",
