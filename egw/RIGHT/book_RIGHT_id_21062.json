    "word": "You will be tempted to unfaithfulness or injustice in apparently small matters, but remember that it was by what seemed a small transgression that our first parents opened the floodgates of woe to our world. Sin does not lose its offensive character because of its commonness; it is sin all the same. Men in responsible positions may transgress the precepts of God's holy law, but it is sin all the same, and a far greater sin in them than in others who have had less light and responsibility. Men in positions of sacred trust are expected to be upright because of their position, but before God their uprightness is measured by their singleness of purpose to honor Him. You should not seek to be men whom the world shall honor, but men whom God can look upon as good and faithful.",
