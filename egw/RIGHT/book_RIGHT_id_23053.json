    "word": "Stand on the side of righteousness in all your transactions; then you will not appear to disadvantage before God or man. Do not enter into any dishonest practises. Those who take up the preparation and sale of health foods for personal profit are taking a liberty to which they have no right. Thus great confusion is brought into the work. Some manufacture foods professing to be health foods which contain ingredients which health reform condemns. Then again, the foods are often of such an inferior quality that much harm is done to the cause by their sale, those who buy them supposing that all health foods are similar.",
