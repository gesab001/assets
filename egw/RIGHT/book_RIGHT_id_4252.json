    "word": "Dear brethren, pray as you never before prayed, for beams from the Sun of Righteousness to shine upon the word, that you may be able to understand its true meaning. Jesus pleaded that his disciples might be sanctified through the truth,\u2014the word of God. Then how earnestly should we pray that He who \u201csearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of \n131\nGod,\u201d [1 Corinthians 2:10.] He whose office it is to bring all things to the remembrance of God's people, and to guide them into all truth, may be with us in the investigation of his holy word.\u2014 MS.",
