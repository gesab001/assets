Did God give you that time message?- No; for no such message comes from the true Source of light. You present your calculations and figures, as many First-day Adventists have done; but your reckoning is founded on \n                                                                           698\nfalse premises. In the little leaflet you sent out you speak of \"thy judgment\" coming in one hour, and that God will work \"his strange work\", and \"cut it short in righteousness,\" and seal to himself a remnant in fifteen days. On page 8 you present Anna's vision in regard to a certain woman as a confirmation of your theory that probation would end in October, 1884. There is nothing to this. Probation is not yet closed; the saints are not yet sealed. In the next paragraph you give Anna's dream in regard to her father. Neither has this any weight, nor the dream your wife has had. They are all false.",
