    "word": "The Lord has appealed to you again and again, rebuking your stubborn, unbelieving spirit, but rather than fall on the Rock and be broken, you become the graft of a strange vine, which in the end will be gathered up and burned. It is difficult for you to throw off the religious faith you have so long professed, but you are not a Christian at heart, for you do not bear the fruits of the Spirit of Christ. A power is working in you, seeking to extinguish the bright beams of Christ's righteousness, which for so many years you have refused to receive. Judas might have been disciplined by the lessons of Christ, as were the other disciples, but he refused to receive and to practice the words of Christ. Though he was thought by the other disciples to be a faithful follower of Christ, he was not transformed in character. He had a formal connection with the little church of disciples, but he had not heart-connection with Christ.",
