    "word": "We all need to study the life of Christ and the lessons He gave, that we may know how to conduct ourselves in our relation with one another. Cherish the soothing influence of the Spirit of God. Remember that speech is a talent of great value, if used aright, and that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. Remember also that by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. Unadvised words often create difficulties which otherwise would not exist.",
