    "word": "I would speak to you and to your ship's company, urging you to do your best; for you have been bought with a price. God deals in infinite tenderness with His heritage. He is not a tyrant, and no man, whatever may be his position or calling, has a right to be harsh and dictatorial. No one is approved of God in being severe, in bruising the souls of his fellow men. I hope and pray for you that you will daily consecrate yourselves to God. The works and ways of God are perfumed with unutterable tenderness and longsuffering love. When you or any other one cherishes a spirit contrary to the Spirit of God, it is evident that you have lost sight of Jesus and are controlled by another spirit. Never, never speak a harsh word. Shall we not give back to God all that He has redeemed? Shall we not give to Him the heart He has converted, the conscience He has enlightened, the affections He has purified, and even the body that He has purchased to be kept unto sanctification and holiness? [Romans 12:1-5, quoted.]",
