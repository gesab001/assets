    "word": "He who seeks to get to heaven by his own righteousness is forever doing, but never making progress. But he who follows where Christ leads the way, goes from strength to strength, from light to greater light. Walking in the path of faith and obedience, he wins others to the new and living way, which is consecrated by the blood of Christ. The light of truth illuminates his footsteps, and the thought of Christ's life inspires his efforts, enabling him to go on from strength to strength, gaining continually in grace and the knowledge of Christ, until at last he is complete in Him, not having his own righteousness, but the righteousness of Christ.",
