    "word": "A lack of faith has been shown by practicing a too rigid economy. Economy is praiseworthy, but there is danger of carrying it too far. You have gone to extremes in practicing economy. In dealing with Eld. Littlejohn sharp words have been uttered over the price given him for his labor. Those who have placed stumbling blocks in his way, who have thought that he was demanding too much, have revealed the spirit controlling them. Men who have an abundance of means, and who are blessed with all their senses, have manifested a parsimonious spirit which is an offence to God. As they cultivate this selfishness they are causing dark chapters to be written in the books of heaven. They do not deal justly; they do not bring mercy and the love of God into their religious experience. They are weighed today in the balances of the sanctuary and found wanting. They would turn even a blind man from his rights.",
