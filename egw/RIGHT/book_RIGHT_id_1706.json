    "word": "Think Well of All Men\nWhen we listen to a reproach against our brother, we take up that reproach. To the question, \"Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in Thy holy hill?\" the psalmist answered, \"He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor.\" Psalm 15:1-3.",
