    "word": "There are those who profess holiness, who declare that they are wholly the Lord's, who claim a right to the promises of God, while they do not render obedience to his commandments. These transgressors of the law claim everything that is promised to the children of God, but this is simply presumption; for John tells us that \u201che that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.\u201d Jesus says, \u201cI have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\u201d [John 15:10.] \n227\nObedience is the true sign of discipleship. \u201cNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\u201d [Matthew 7:21.]",
