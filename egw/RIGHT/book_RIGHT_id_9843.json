    "word": "Said Paul, \"I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith . . . . Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them\" (Romans 1:16-19).",
