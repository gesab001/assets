    "word": "There are many today who profess to serve God, but who are not doing so in reality. But when Christ comes it will be known who are the chosen of God. \u201cThen shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not. For, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\u201d",
