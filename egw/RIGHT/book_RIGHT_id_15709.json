    "word": "It is the apostasy from truth that worketh in the children of disobedience to silence the voice of those who are calling them to obedience, and provoke the loyal to become disloyal as Cain tried to provoke Abel. A demoniacal spirit takes possession of men in our world. . . . Demon intelligence . . . will rend and destroy man formed in the divine similitude because . . . [man] cannot control the conscience of his brother and make him disloyal to God's holy law, because he himself is unrighteous like Cain, who was disobedient. . . .",
