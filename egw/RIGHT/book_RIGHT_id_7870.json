    "word": "\"The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mercy.\" Psalm 147:11. But it is only through the value of the sacrifice made for us that we are of value in the Lord's sight. It is because of the imputed righteousness of Christ that we are counted precious by God. For Christ's sake He pardons them that fear Him. He does not see in them the vileness of the sinner; He recognizes in them the likeness of His Son, in whom they believe. In this way only can God take pleasure in any of us. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\" John 1:12.",
