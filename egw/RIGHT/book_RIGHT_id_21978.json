    "word": "Had our brother, who has assumed many responsibilities that God has not laid upon him, devoted his energies to that which for years the Lord has bidden him do he would now be a much safer man to entrust with larger responsibilities. But he does not discern the truth for this time. He has been framing false theories, and by these he governs himself. He thinks and asserts that he is right, but he does not understand the testing truth for this time. Unless he is converted, it will not be safe to accept him as a leader. He who stands as a leader of God's people should do nothing that will mislead, nothing that will bring in false theories and sentiments.",
