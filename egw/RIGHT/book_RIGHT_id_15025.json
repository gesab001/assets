    "word": "Christ is the great Master Worker. We are laborers together with Him. He has a right to give each one his work. And let each one be sure to do the work given him. Let us do faithfully the work that the Lord has placed in our minds. He who neglects his definite work for the work that some one else has in charge is out of place. Time is lost, confidence abused and shaken, and the work hindered. When we learn to attend closely to our own special work, the Lord will help us, and all parts of His cause will move in harmony.--Letter 202, Dec. 15, 1902, to \"My Dear Brethren and Sisters.\"",
