    "word": "Today while praying over the matter, duty seemed to demand I should go to your grandfather. I have prepared you (Edson) comfortable clothing for winter, which I send to you by Elder Loughborough. I hope they will give you as much pleasure in wearing them as I have taken pleasure in making them for you. I have sat up late and arisen early, before anyone was astir, to work upon them. Prayers that you may be clothed with Christ's righteousness are stitched into these garments.---Letter 5, 1886, p. 1. (To Edson White, October 7, 1886.)",
