    "word": "Hundreds of youth of various dispositions and of different education are associated in the school, and great care as well as much patience is required to balance in the right direction minds that have been warped by bad management. Some have never been disciplined, and others have been governed too much and have felt, when away from the vigilant hands that held the reigns of control, perhaps too tightly, that they were free to do as they pleased. They despise the very thought of restraint. These varying elements brought together in our college, bring care, burdens, and weighty responsibility, not only upon teachers, but on the entire church.",
