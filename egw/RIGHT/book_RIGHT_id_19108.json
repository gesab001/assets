    "word": "Oh, the Christian's last days may be fragrant because the beams of the Sun of Righteousness shine through the life, diffusing a perpetual fragrance. Oh, what reason have we for joy that our Redeemer poured out His precious blood on the cross as an atonement for sin, and, by His obedience to death, brought in everlasting righteousness. You know that today He is at the Father's right hand, a Prince of life, a Saviour. There is no other name wherein you can trust your eternal interests, but in Christ you may rely fully, implicitly. Christ has been loved by you, although your faith has sometimes been feeble and your prospects confused. But Jesus is your Saviour. \n\n\n                                    -128- \n\nHe does not save you because you are perfect, but because you need Him and in your imperfection have trusted in Him. Jesus loves you, my precious child. You may sing, \"Under the shadow of Thy throne still may we dwell secure; Sufficient is Thine arm alone, And our defense is sure.\"--Letter 46, 1879, pp. 1-3. (To Lucretia Cranson Canright, February 21, 1879.) (She died March 29, 1879.) \n\nReleased August 10, 1977.",
