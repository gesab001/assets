    "word": "Arriving in California, Sunday, February 29, 1880--We had a beautiful sunrise. The sky was broadly striped with crimson, gold, and silver. What a picture of loveliness painted for us by the great Master Artist! Instinctively my heart was filled with gratitude to God. His wondrous love to fallen man, in giving His Son to shame, reproach, insult, mocking, and an ignominious death, seemed so deep, so rich, so broad, my heart throbbed with glad joy that I was privileged to be a child of God. In the night I found dear Mary resting upon her elbow viewing in the bright moonbeams the scenery \n\n\n                                      -63- \n\nof nature. We passed Cape Horn in the night. Wild, grandly wild, was the scene. Arrived at Oakland about eleven o'clock. We were received heartily by our friends.--Ms. 7, 1880, p. 2. (Diary entry.)",
