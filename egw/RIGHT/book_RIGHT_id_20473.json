    "word": "Many of the leading men have dishonored the Lord. They have been false shepherds, and have led the flock of God astray. Teachers and rulers must be disciplined by disappointment, hardship, and affliction. Unless they are willing to learn of Christ His meekness and lowliness, they are not fitted to teach. Their example of self-righteousness will do nothing to advance the work of God.",
