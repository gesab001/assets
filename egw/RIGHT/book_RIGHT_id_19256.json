    "word": "Walking With God \n\n     Enoch walked with God. So may every laborer for Christ. You may say with the psalmist, \"I have set the Lord always before me: because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved\" (Psalm 16:8).

If you go to God for help and wisdom He will never disappoint your faith. \n\n\n                                      -142-",
