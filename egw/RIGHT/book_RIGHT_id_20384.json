    "word": "MR No. 1262 - Counsel Regarding a Second Marriage\n\n     (Written August 26, 1895, from Cooranbong, N.S.W., Australia, to \"Dear Sister\" [Mrs. Ketring].) \n\n\n     I have received and read your letter, and will make but a brief reply, for the American mail, which closes on Monday, must have my attention. In regard to the marriage of your daughter with J, I see where you are troubled. But the marriage took place with your consent, and your daughter, knowing all about him, accepted him as her husband, and now I can see no reason why you should carry any burden over this matter. Your daughter loves J, and it may be that this marriage is in the order of God that both J and your daughter may have a richer Christian experience and be built up where they are deficient. Your daughter has pledged herself to J in marriage, and to break her marriage vows would be far from right. She cannot now disannul her obligations to him.",
