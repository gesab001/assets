    "word": "How vain are the devices of man against God! Man may propose and plan and devise, but the Lord disposes of all matters to His own name's glory. Let us bear in mind that one of the most painful occurrences connected with religious controversy is the too-often ungenerous, unrighteous bearing of self in those who are engaged in it. They speak sharp things which are only reflected back to injure themselves. All controversies are to be shunned, for they seldom advance the truth. Human passion should never appear in religious controversy. We are not to silence and humiliate, but to convince men of the truth as it is in Jesus. Evil is to be overcome with good.",
