    "word": "In our Institutions for health, especially, should the pure and holy principles take root downward, and the result will be that fruit will appear. Unless the spirit and principles which characterized the life of Christ be planted in the heart, they will not control the life. Very many professed Christians are so only in name. They have no root in themselves. They have a superficial knowledge of the truth, and break off some of their evil practices; but the heart is still filled with pride, impurities, unholy ambition, self-importance, and love for the supremacy. The soul temple must be cleansed of its defilement, there must be purity of thought and intensity of desire, united with earnest efforts to meet the standard in God's word, or they will never become elevated, subdued, purified, and wear the white linen which is the righteousness of the saints, and become fitted for the companionship of the pure and holy.",
