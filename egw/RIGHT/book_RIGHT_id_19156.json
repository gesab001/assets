    "word": "If your eyes were fixed upon Jesus, if you were contemplating His unsurpassed purity and excellence, you would see your own weakness and poverty and defects as they are. You would not regard yourself as holy. You would see yourself lost and hopeless, clad in garments of self-righteousness, like every other sinner. If we are saved, it will not be because of our superior intellect, our refinement of ideas, but through the grace of God. We have no garment of our own that will give us a position of honor at the marriage supper of the Lamb. Christ's robe alone, the garment woven in the loom of heaven, will give to the guests a worthiness to sit down at the marriage feast. Each must accept this robe, and it is offered to the lowliest who will believe in Him as his personal Saviour. The imputed righteousness of Christ alone can make the sons and daughters of Adam members of the family in heaven.--Ms 62, 1899, pp. 1, 3.
