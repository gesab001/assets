    "word": "In your conference meetings there were heard pleasant presentations in regard to the consolidation of the Pacific Publishing House with the publishing interests at Battle Creek. This, it was proposed, should not interfere with their independence and rights, but that the General Conference should be to the interests on the Pacific Coast what fathers and mothers are to their children. These were very pleasant presentations; but I was carried into the future and was shown those who sanctioned these principles laying plans to control the work on the Pacific Coast. I was shown that if this plan were adopted, the publishing interests there would be swallowed up by the methods and plans of those who wanted more power, who were contending as to who should be first, who should carry the greatest honors, who should have the supremacy.",
