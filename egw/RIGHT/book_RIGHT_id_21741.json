    "word": "I ask you who shall meet in conference, Will you individually act your part, through the grace given you of God, to lift just as much of the burden as you can lift? Bear your own burdens. Pray much, talk less, meditate more. Rid yourselves of every jealous thought and feeling. Your hearts need weeding before you enter upon conference business. Divest yourselves of selfishness, but stand firmly for right principles, cost what it may. The right alone will prevail.",
