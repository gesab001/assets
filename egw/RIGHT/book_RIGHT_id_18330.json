    "word": "In the time of the Flood nearly all the inhabitants of the world thought that they were right and that Noah was wrong. They claimed that they knew more than that faithful servant of God, and thus closed their ears to words of truth, and darkness came upon them. There were those then, as today who explain away the truth by false science. They branded Noah as a fanatic. They explained to the people the foolishness of Noah's statement that a rain would come upon the earth when no signs of such had ever existed. God's message was to come to them through Noah, but they laughed and mocked at his words, and said, Does he not speak in parables? But their unbelief did not prevent the Flood, and they finally drank the waters that covered the earth. We do not want to be like them.",
