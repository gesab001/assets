    "word": "No human being is to seek to bind other human beings to himself, as if he were to control them, telling them to do this, and forbidding them to do that, commanding, dictating, acting like an officer over a company of soldiers. This is the way that the priests and rulers did in Christ's day. But it is not the right way. After the truth has made an impression on hearts, and men and women have accepted the truth, they are to be treated as the property of Christ, not as the property of man. Elder Franke must remember this. His words of forbidding and commanding are contrary to the example Christ has given.",
