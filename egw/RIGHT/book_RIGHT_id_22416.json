    "word": "I feel the burden on my soul to present not only the law but the gospel. One is not complete without the other. We hear so many who are deceived by the enemy constantly claiming, \"I am saved; I am saved;\" but you present God's great moral standard of righteousness before them, and \n                                                                           780\nthey show such contempt of God's rule of righteousness that we know that they do not know what it means to be saved. They have caught up the words, and repeat them parrot-like, while they know nothing of saving grace. The heart is not in harmony with the law of God, but is at enmity with that law. Thus was the great rebel in heaven. Will the Lord take men and women to heaven who have no respect for the law of His universe?",
