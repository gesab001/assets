    "word": "Because those who are handling sacred things do not walk in the light, that light is becoming darkness to them, and how great is that darkness. They are making strange mistakes in reading character. Men who do not possess moral worth are exalted, while those who are endeavoring to seek the Lord and walk in His steps are not appreciated. This danger will become more and more apparent. We must awake to the perils that are opening around us. All Phariseeism, all self-righteousness, must be separated from the soul. Then we shall realize that we need Christ's righteousness, and we shall accept it by faith.",
