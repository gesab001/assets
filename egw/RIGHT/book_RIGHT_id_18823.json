    "word": "Every one before me, whether white or black, is to be a missionary for Christ. Students, we want you to bring others to this school. And we want you \n\n\n                                    -214- \n\nto do your level best yourselves in gaining a fitness for service. You have precious opportunities here, and we want you to learn how to educate the minds and hands of others, so that they in turn can lead still others to Christ, and receive a crown of rejoicing. You are to be patient, kind, gentle, and yet strong for the right. You are to place your feet on the platform of eternal truth,--the platform that no storm or tempest can sweep away. Do you ask what this platform is? It is the law of God. He says that if you will keep His commandments, you will be a kingdom of priests, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.",
