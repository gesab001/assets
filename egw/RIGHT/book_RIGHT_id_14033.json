    "word": "But the robes of Christ's righteousness never cover cherished sins. No one can enter into the marriage supper of the Lamb without the wedding garment on, which is the righteousness of Christ. Without holiness no man shall see God. God is waiting to give divine power to every soul to combine with human effort. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\"",
