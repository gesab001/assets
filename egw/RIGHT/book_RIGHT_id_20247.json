    "word": "A surgeon, a physician, a teacher, a guide, needs to study carefully and attentively the way in which to do the work which is entrusted to his hands. How much more should those who are entrusted with the sacred responsibility to watch for souls as they that must give an account, study to work in harmony with the truth and in accordance with the wisdom which is from above, which is \"first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace\" [James 3:17, 18].",
