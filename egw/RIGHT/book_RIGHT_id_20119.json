    "word": "Here the free gift of God to men is plainly set forth. It is the free forgiveness of all sins, without man's rendering any equivalent. The Lord gives this lesson in order that man may see how he should treat his fellow men--that, as God for Christ's sake has forgiven his sins, he should forgive his brethren who err. If he is an overcomer at last, it will not be because of his own righteousness, but through the righteousness of Christ, and the long forbearance, mercy, and forgiveness of God. If he does not cherish kindness, love, and a forgiving spirit toward his brethren, he will not be of the number who shall receive forgiveness of God.",
