    "word": "Among the workers there will be some who are active and energetic; there will be some who are slow. They are so long in arriving at conclusions that if their way is followed, much precious time is lost, and often the delay proves dangerous. The slow worker should be constantly learning of the diligent, quick worker. \"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\" Every one who enters the service of Christ should constantly feel that he is a laborer, and should improve in his habits and his manner of work. He is to blend with his brethren, not flattering himself that his methods of work are the very best. Let him learn in the school of Christ the lessons of meekness and lowliness. All who do learn of Christ will work in Christ's lines; then we shall surely harmonize. He \n                                                                           19\nwho is inclined to criticize and depreciate his brethren, will find that the Spirit of God is not with him. He does not obey the injunction to esteem others better than himself; but, like the self-righteous Pharisee, he draws comparisons between his brother's work and his own. Cooperating with God, every laborer will work as Christ worked.",
