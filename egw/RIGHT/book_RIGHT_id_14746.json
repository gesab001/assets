    "word": "Our spiritual strength and blessing will be proportionate to the labor of love and good works which we perform. The injunction of the apostle is, \"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ\" (Galatians 6:2). Keeping the commandments of God requires of us good works, self-denial, self-sacrifice, and devotion for the good of others, not that our good works alone can save us, but that we surely cannot be saved without good works. After we have done all that we are capable of doing we are then to say, We have done no more than our duty, and at best are unprofitable servants, unworthy of the smallest favor from God. Christ must be our righteousness. . . .",
