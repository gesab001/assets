    "word": "Our dear Saviour says again, \"I am the true vine and ye are the branches and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth not fruit he taketh it away.\" Now we want to know what fruit we are bearing. We want our fruits shall be right before the world in the ministry of Christ on the earth, and they can be if we will. We have all these advantages and how thankful we should be. The Lord brought this place right into our hands. What advantages we have in this very place! But there are other places where they need help, and let every one who can, take his Bible in his hand and see what missionary work he can do; carry with him some of the little books that we have published, and if the people do not want to buy, leave the books with them, and tell them to read them whether they want to buy or not; and if any of you want to give some away, just do that. There is a chance to let our light shine and we want to do so. Now Satan has the advantage in many things. He can quote those glories that he had in the heavenly sanctuary just as though they belonged to him, and he will quote these things. He is working upon human minds and he will bring in all (896) the sophistries that he can bring in, and mix it in with some of his wonderful learning and agency that he had in the heavenly courts. The world will certainly think that he is excellent. We want all that excellency and power, but we shall have the light of truth which is to shine. But Satan will present that light that he had in the heavenly courts, and many will think that it must be the truth, and they are intelligent men and good women, and he leads them right along to perdition.",
