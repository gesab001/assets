    "word": "Today quarterly meeting was held in the church. Willie spoke from Isaiah 50:10, 11. In the afternoon the Lord's supper was administered, preceded by the ordinance of feetwashing. The celebration of these ordinances is the fulfilling of the command, \"If I, then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye ought also to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.\" What a place is this for hushing controversies, for forgiving those who have done us any injury. This is the time, if one has anything against his brother, to make it right, to settle every difficulty. Let there be mutual forgiveness. Let no strange flame be brought to the altar. Let no malice, no hatred, be cherished by those who meet round the communion table. Let high and low, rich and poor, learned and unlearned, meet together as those purchased by the blood of Christ.",
