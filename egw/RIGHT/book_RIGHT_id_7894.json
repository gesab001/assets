    "word": "Shall we look at our sins, and begin to mourn, and say, I have done wrong, and I cannot come to God with any degree of confidence? Does not the Bible say, \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\"? 1 John 1:9. It is a proper thing for us to have a realization of the terrible character of sin. It was sin that caused Christ to suffer ignominious death on Calvary. But while we should understand that sin is a terrible thing, yet we should not listen to the voice of our adversary, who says, \"You have sinned, and you have no right to claim the promises of God.\" You should say to the adversary, \"It is written, 'If any man sin, we have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous' (1 John 2:1).\" . . .",
