    "word": "My brother, I beg you not to let A. T. Jones manifest himself in coming forward to receive that which you suppose to be your right and your due. Nothing has been revealed to me showing that you have in any way suffered wrong in regard to the royalty on books. I have seen that some others have not been dealt with justly, but I have no recollection of seeing your case in this connection. There is need of constant watchfulness on your part, my brother. Be careful lest in dealing with the mistakes of others that have been reproved, you make a mistake yourself in being sharp and hard, critical and exacting.",
