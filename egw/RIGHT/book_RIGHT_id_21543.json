    "word": "And what does He say? You ask in faith, and do not waver about it. There is the trouble. We go from our petitions and do not know whether we are blessed or not. We say, \"I wish that I did know.\" What does that mean? \"You said it, Lord, but I don't believe it.\" You must ask without wavering, \"for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.\" He is tossed right between the waves. One wave after another comes, and our faith goes out like water out of a leaky vessel. It is to believe and to watch unto prayer.--Ms 83, 1891. (MR 900.53)",
