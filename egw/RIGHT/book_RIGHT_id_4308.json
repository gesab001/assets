    "word": "When the importance of laboring to reach the higher classes is urged, let none receive the idea that the poor and unlearned are to be neglected. Right methods of labor will not in any sense exclude these. It was one of the evidences of Christ's Messiahship that the poor had the gospel preached to them. We should study to give all classes an opportunity to understand the special truths for this time. When our labors are so conducted as to reach only the lower classes, we may fail in benefiting even these. They may be brought to see the truth, but they are, as it were, in the bondage of poverty, and can see before them only starvation should they accept the truth. If our efforts are so conducted as to include the upper classes, we shall be more successful in reaching the lower also.",
