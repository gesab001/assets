    "word": "Voice, Hearing God's, or the Echo of His.--The voice of God is heard, but we may be so far away from Him that we can only hear the echo. There are words of instruction coming from God day by day, and in an hour that we know not He may give words to His chosen messengers for us which we lose for want of discernment and appreciation. Then we go stumbling along in the uncertainty of night, and know not at what we stumble. There is a brightening glory for us as we advance, but which we shall never see unless we do advance. We may catch a few sparks, but that is all. The brightness of the heavenly glory we do not see. Therefore we cannot talk of it, or pray about it.--Letter 147, 1897.",
