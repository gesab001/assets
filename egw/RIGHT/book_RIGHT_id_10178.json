    "word": "(Genesis 9:13-17; Revelation 4:3.) Bow Shows Righteousness of Christ, Mercy, and Justice.--In the rainbow above the throne is an everlasting testimony that \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish. . . .\" Whenever the law is presented before the people, let the teacher of truth point to the throne arched with the rainbow of promise, the righteousness of Christ. The glory of the law is Christ; He came to magnify the law, and to make it honorable. Make it appear distinct that mercy and peace have met together in Christ, and righteousness and truth have embraced each other. . . .",
