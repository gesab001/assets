    "word": "In my last vision I was shown that . . . missionary labor must be extended. I was shown also that a paper would be published on the Pacific Coast, and that not far in the future a publishing house must be established there. This will be a strength to the work. The bright rays which God has given us will go forth from it to all parts of our world. . . . The beginning will be small, but the work will advance and extend. . . . Our message is to go forth in power to all parts of the world--to Oregon, England, Australia, to the Islands of the sea, to all nations, tongues, and peoples. Many countries are waiting for the advanced light the Lord has for them, and your faith must grow. . . . Go forward and upward; God will work in accordance with your faith and devotedness to the advancement of His cause.--Ms 1, 1874, pp. 16, 17.
