    "word": "I did not intend to write all this, when I took up my pen to answer your letter. I meant simply to tell you that we love you, and would be pleased to see you. Now I will write no more except to inquire how your health is. Do you feel that you need a change? Let me know how you are situated, for I feel \n\n\n                                    -62- \n\nthat I have a right to know this. Let me know what your plans for the future are. I have not lost my interest in you, be sure of this. Do not interpret my silence so. I have an interest in you just as verily as I ever had.--Letter 16, 1909, pp. 1-5. (To Sarah Peck, January 11, 1909.)",
