CAROL HAS ENCOURAGED A \n     FRIENDSHIP THAT HAS ALMOST TOTALLY ABSORBED \n     THE ATTENTION OF BOTH OF THEM. IT HAS \n     GONE FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF WHAT IS \n     RIGHT AND HONORABLE, AND THEY ARE DEEPLY \n     INVOLVED IN PRACTICES THAT SHOULD, AS ELLEN \n     WHITE SAYS, BE RESERVED FOR MARRIAGE.",
