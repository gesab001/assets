    "word": "The Lord is not pleased with the position of those who have a knowledge of the truth but do not keep it. They do not practice the truth. In their soul the love of Christ is eclipsed. Their principles of action are not sanctified, \n\n\n                                   -162- \n\nrighteous, holy. Self is the supreme idol. By the words they speak, they show that they have given themselves over to do Satan's work, to drop seeds which will produce tares. They repeat words that were spoken to them in confidence, and betray their friends. Anything that will cut the threads of union between brother and brother, between sister and sister, is looked upon as a worthy action. Satan stands by and laughs to think that he can so easily inspire the tongue to utter words which will kindle a fire not easily quenched.",
