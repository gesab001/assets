    "word": "Christ invites all to come to Him, but when they come, they are to lay aside their sins. All their vices and follies, all their pride and worldliness, are to be laid at [the foot of] His cross. This He requires because He loves them, and desires to save them, not in their sins but from their sins. He who accepts the truth longs for transformation, and the light comes to him in bright rays.",
