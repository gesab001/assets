    "word": "The Lord will not accept donations to his cause from means gained by the robbing of his treasury. This is not the way to make wrong deeds right. It will not blot out the record from the books of heaven. God requires strict impartiality in deal between man and man. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\"",
