    "word": "There are souls to be saved. But in wasting your talent of influence, you cannot be laborers together with God, working for the salvation of others. God would have you rightfully direct every jot of influence you possess. He calls for you to whom He has given great light to cooperate with heavenly intelligences. Those who have great light and precious capabilities will have a large field in which their influence may tell unto life eternal; but if those who have been richly endowed of heaven, withhold their gifts from God's service, and misapply them in the service of self and the world, they will be punished in proportion to the light which they have persistently refused. God has made the youth the depositaries of the truth that is to be imparted to the world. . . . Christ is calling for whole-hearted, sincere servants, who will not be turned from their position of duty by allurements or opposition,--who will not fail or be discouraged. Will you give Him your names? Will you be among those who shall be light-bearers? Will you give yourself to Him to be employed as His agents to arrest the steps of many who are going on the road to perdition?",
