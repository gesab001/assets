    "word": "Jesus would reflect His light and grace through us to others. Then come close to Jesus; open the door of the heart that the bright beams of Christ's righteousness may shine into our souls to be reflected upon others. We are to be constantly reaching upward to God. Think much, and talk little of ourselves, but talk of Jesus; dwell upon His matchless charms. Talk not of our trials, brood not over our privations, but remember Jesus, the Son of God.",
