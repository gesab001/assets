    "word": "It is not necessary for us to know the results of our course of action before we surrender wholly to God. We do not need to see the way, or to know what the future will be. One thing we do know, because God has said it--the man that fears God and works righteousness will be accepted by Him. This is enough for us to know. Day by day walk before the Lord in humility and contrition. Your future destiny depends on your own course of action. \"Choose you this day whom ye will serve\" (Joshua 24:15). \"If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him\" (1 Kings 18:21). Be one thing or the other. \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon\" (Luke 16:13). Your present happiness and your future well-being depend on your own choice. If you choose to follow Jesus, you must obey the word, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Matthew 16:24).",
