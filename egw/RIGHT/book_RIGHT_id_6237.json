    "word": "Preserving Health\n     Those who engage in the service of God have no right to disregard the laws of life and health. We have important responsibilities to fulfil in regard to ourselves. There is much work to be done for God, and He desires us to guard against bringing ourselves into such a condition of health that we shall be unable to help in this work. We should not, by taking on too many burdens, or by indulging any unhealthful habit, unfit ourselves for the service of God. The Lord desires us to be spiritually and physically healthy, that we may exert a pure, wholesome influence. Then He can impart blessings to us to impart to others.",
