    "word": "Through the Saviour's lesson, Nicodemus was brought to see that the ignorant and unbelieving are not to be enlightened by controversy and discussion. They must look and live. Nicodemus hoped that his people would let Christ speak to them as he had spoken to him; then they would no longer remain in unbelief. O that today men would hear the voice of Jesus, \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" The explanation of the plan of salvation may today be presented to men who act as rulers and counsellors, and yet, having eyes, they see not, and having ears they hear not; they have no experimental knowledge of what it means to believe in Christ as their personal Saviour. Nicodemus was converted. Will these men learn what it means to have a new heart? What it means to cease from sin? What it means to have the righteousness of Christ, to bear the divine similitude?",
