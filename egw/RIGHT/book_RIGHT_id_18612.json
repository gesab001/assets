    "word": "Jesus is our advocate, He is our friend at court. Let us lean on His almighty arm, and go on our way rejoicing, making melody in our hearts unto the Lord. Jesus is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption. In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. You have a complete Saviour, who is close by your side, and with and through Him you can do all things. You need not seek for more efficient aid. The cause and work in which you are engaged is the Lord's, and He is able to bring forth a people, tried, purified, and made white. There is a God in Israel, who is full of wisdom, grace and power. He who is mighty in counsel will preside at every meeting.",
