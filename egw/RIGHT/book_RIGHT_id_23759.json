    "word": "We desire no one to be connected with the Huntsville School who reveals a faithless, unprofitable religion. Whatever a man\u2019s profession, unless he daily learns of the great Teacher, he needs to be converted by the grace of Christ. He who is to impart instruction to others must receive from Christ the heavenly wisdom. I raise this note of warning that those who teach the colored people need to have a heart imbued with the love of Christ, in order to give an example of faithfulness, truthfulness, and righteousness. The world is in need of the light of good and gracious words, coming from a heart illuminated by the light of the Word of God, a heart softened and subdued and sanctified.",
