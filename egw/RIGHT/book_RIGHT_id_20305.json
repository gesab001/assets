    "word": "I was pained when I saw your article in the Review, and for the last half hour I have been reading the references preceding your pamphlet. [ELDER BUTLER'S 85-PAGE PAMPHLET BORE THE TITLE, THE LAW IN THE BOOK OF GALATIANS: IS IT THE MORAL LAW, OR DOES IT REFER TO THAT SYSTEM OF LAWS PECULIARLY JEWISH? IT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO THE DELEGATES WHO ATTENDED THE 1886 GENERAL CONFERENCE SESSION.] \n\n\n                                     -282- \n\nNow, my brother, things that you have said, many of them are all right. The principles that you refer to are right; but how this can harmonize with your pointed remarks to Dr. Waggoner, I cannot see. I think you are too sharp. And then when this is followed by a pamphlet published of your own views, be assured I cannot feel that you are just right at this point to do this unless you give the same liberty to Dr. Waggoner.",
