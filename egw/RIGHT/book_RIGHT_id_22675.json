    "word": "I fear for my brethren who are intrusted with grave responsibilities; for I have been shown how difficult it is for human nature to be under the control of the Spirit of God and to bear God-given responsibilities meekly. Those whom God would make representative men, illustrious for good, spoil their own lives because they do not make God their fear and their continual counselor, and do not walk humbly before Him as did Daniel. They indulge selfishness, self-esteem, and do not maintain strict faithfulness, or manifest a Christlike spirit in their dealings with those who are God's purchased possession and whom Christ calls His brethren. Many men God has tested and tried who, if they had been faithful in the smallest and largest matters, working as if in the sight of the whole universe of heaven, the Holy Spirit of God would have used in a special manner; they would have presented to the world, to angels and to men, an example in good works that would have been as a bright light kindled at the divine altar, and shining forth to the world in no fitful rays, but clear and steady, increasing in intensity, so that men, beholding, should be led to glorify our heavenly Father.",
