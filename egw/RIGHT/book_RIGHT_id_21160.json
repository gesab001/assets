    "word": "You guiltless, my dear erring brother! No, you are not. Your soul is spotted and stained with sin. God had His witness recording the most secret actions of your life. You have the Word of God. A voice is addressing you from the living oracles testifying that one class of actions is right and just, and doing them is righteousness; but the same voice is heard in reproofs and warnings, prohibiting and condemning another course of action that will lead to certain ruin of both soul and body, unless there is a reform.",
