    "word": "We must not try to hide the truth in the corners of the earth. It must be made known, it must shine in our large cities. Christ in his labors took his position with his disciples, by the lakeside, and by the great thoroughfares of travel, where people were to be met from all parts of the world. He was giving the true light; he was sowing the gospel seed; he was rescuing truth from the companionship of error, and presenting it in clear, bright rays, so that men could comprehend it.",
