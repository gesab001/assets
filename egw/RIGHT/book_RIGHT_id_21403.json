    "word": "Then after the Brighton camp meeting we had that long, soul-disheartening revelation made to us that you thought that Marian and yourself should be recognized as the ones [who] were putting talent into my works. I had a talk with Srs. Colcord and Salisbury, when I related to them the trouble I had experienced with your perversion of facts in regard to your work on my writings. These sisters told me that you had told them the same story. You also told it to Sr. Miller. The same words which Sr. Malcolm told me you had said to her, you repeated to Sr. Colcord. At first Sr. Miller said you had said nothing to her; but Sr. Salisbury said, \"I heard Fannie say these words to you,\" (repeating what you had told Sister Malcolm). Sr. Miller then said that she had \n                                                                           74\nforgotten, but now remembered what you had said.

You yourself have adopted much of them, and interwoven them with your own articles, which I recognize.",
