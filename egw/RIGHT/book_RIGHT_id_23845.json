    "word": "While special pains may be taken to make the school what it should be, two or three students, who act like larrikins, may make it very hard for those who are trying to maintain order. The students who want to do right, who want to think soberly, are greatly hindered by the association of those who are doing cheap miserable work. \"In the multitude of word there wanteth not sin.\" A few may be able to separate from such company, and retire to some place where they can ask the Lord Jesus to guard them from all defilement by keeping their minds stayed upon him. But the trial to which they are subjected by their associates is not at all necessary.",
