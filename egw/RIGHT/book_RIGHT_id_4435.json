    "word": "Ministers are to present Christ in His fulness both in the churches and in new fields, that the hearers may have an intelligent faith.

It is Satan's studied purpose to keep souls from believing in Christ as their only hope; for the blood of Christ that cleanseth from all sin is efficacious in behalf of those only who believe in its merit, and who present it before the Father as did Abel in his offering.",
