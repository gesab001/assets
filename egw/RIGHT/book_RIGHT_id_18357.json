    "word": "Wright, Mich., Thursday, April 30, 1868. Arose at four o'clock, and prepared for our journey to Monterey. . . . We took our dinner in the carriage. The roads were rough, the day was raw and cold. Our wagon broke going over the rough log ways. . . . [I] did not speak as carefully and as cheerfully as I ought. Confessed this before leaving the carriage.--Ms 15, 1868",
