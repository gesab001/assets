    "word": "When the human agent feels his need of the Sun of Righteousness, when he comes to Jesus saying, Lord, I am sinful, unworthy, hopeless; save me, or I perish, he is accepted in the beloved, and his heart is warmed by the rays of divine love. In this sincere coming to Christ he opens the door to Him who has long been saying, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\" He is accepted by faith, and he knows what it means to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.--Ms 164, 1898, pp. 1, 4. (\"Be Ye Therefore Perfect,\" typed December 14, 1898.)",
