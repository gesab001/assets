    "word": "The Lord then sent the plague of the murrain upon their cattle, and at the same time preserved the cattle of the Hebrews, that not one of them died. Next came the plague of the boil upon man and beast, and the magicians could not protect themselves from it. The Lord then sent upon Egypt the plague of the hail mingled with fire, with lightnings and thunder. The time of each plague was given before it came that it might not be said to have happened by chance. The Lord demonstrated to the Egyptians that the whole earth was under the command of the God of the Hebrews--that thunder, hail, and storm obey his voice. Pharaoh, the proud king, who once inquired, Who is the Lord that I should obey his voice? humbled himself and said, I have sinned. The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. He begged of Moses to be his intercessor with God that the terrific thunder and lightning might cease.",
