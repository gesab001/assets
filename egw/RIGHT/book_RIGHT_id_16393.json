    "word": "Hold Fast to God's Principles. \n\n     No counsel of men can with safety remove God's principles, and set up their own; for the word of God declares. \"Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.\" \"For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. Now therefore \n\n\n                      - 49 - \n\nbe ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord God of Hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.\"",
