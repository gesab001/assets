    "word": "The world is not to be our instructor; it sets up its standards which some suppose to be just the thing to be adopted; but they are no rule for us. God has chosen us out of the world; therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not. The motto of every true Christian should be, I must be in the world, and not of the world. We are not to be conformed to the world. The world will be impressed with the gospel only as we speak and act as the representatives of Christ, as the members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King, pilgrims and strangers, seeking a better country, even a heavenly. It is our privilege to show forth the praises of him who hath called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. Never is the least injustice to be done to God's subjects, the purchase of his blood. The Lord's way must be kept, and his way is exalted in righteousness. Christians, in their manner and words and character, are to reveal their heavenly extraction. We are never to apologize to the world for being Christians and daring to be right.",
