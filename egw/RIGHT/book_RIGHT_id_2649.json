    "word": "Dear Sister Patience:  I have been having a long talk with my son W. C. White as to how we can best conduct the sanitarium at Washington, D.C.  I told him that I had a conversation with your father in reference to your connecting with our sanitarium there.  There is need of a lady physician's connecting with the institution at once.  The experience that we have had during the past few days has decided us to secure a capable lady physician who can care for the women patients and be matron of the home, that the patients may receive prompt attention and that the helpers may be given\n99\nthe right kind of instruction, such as you can give.  The young ladies connected with the institution should be taught to act their part intelligently.",
