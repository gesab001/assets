    "word": "The workers connected with our sanitariums are to be sympathetic, kind, and straightforward in their dealings with one another and with the patients. Their words and deeds are to be noble and upright. They are ever to receive from Christ light and grace and love to impart to those in darkness. By their efforts the sick, the sinful, the prodigals who have left the Father's house are to be encouraged to return. God's word to these workers is, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" \"Fear not, neither be discouraged: for I am thy God.\" \n     December, 1904 \n\n                                               -",
