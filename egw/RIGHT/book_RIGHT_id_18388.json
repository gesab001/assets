    "word": "It is important that we should live as Solomon was admonished in verses 4 to 6 of 1 Kings 9: \"And if thou wilt walk before Me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep My statutes and My judgments; then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel forever, as I promised \n\n\n                                         -233- \n\nto David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. But if ye shall at all turn from following Me, ye or your children, and will not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them.\" We see that God's promises are to the obedient, those that keep the commandments of God. If we depart from His law, then we are separated from Heaven. God does not separate from us, but we separate from Him.",
