Canright's Actions \n\n\n     (Written April 5, 1887, from Basel, Switzerland, to \"Dear Brethren [G. I.] Butler and [Uriah] Smith.\") \n\n\n     I have sent copies of letters written to Brethren [E. J.] Waggoner and [A. T.] Jones to Elder [G. I.] Butler in reference to introducing and keeping in front and making prominent subjects on which there are differences of opinion. I sent this not that you should make them weapons to use against the brethren mentioned, but that the very same cautions and carefulness be exercised by you to preserve harmony as you would have these brethren exercise.",
