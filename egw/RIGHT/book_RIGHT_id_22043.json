    "word": "How shall we encourage you to have faith in God? You say, \"How can I talk faith, how can I have faith, when clouds and darkness and despondency come over my mind? I do not feel as though I could talk faith; I do not feel that I have any faith to talk.\" But why do you feel in this way?--It is because you have permitted Satan to cast his dark shadow across your pathway, and you cannot see the light that Jesus sheds upon your pathway. But another says: \"I am very frank; I say just what I feel, I talk just as I think.\" Is that the best way to do?--No; God wants us to educate ourselves so that we shall speak right words,--words that will be a blessing to others, that will shed rays of light upon their souls.",
