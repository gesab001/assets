    "word": "We cannot provide a robe of righteousness for ourselves, for the prophet says, \u201cAll our righteousnesses are as filthy rags\u201d (Isaiah 64:6).

We are to receive the robe of righteousness woven in the loom of heaven, even the spotless robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness. We are to say, \u201cHe died for me. He bore my soul\u2019s disgrace, that in His name I might be an overcomer and be exalted to His throne.\u201d",
