    "word": "I had hoped that Brother and Sister _____ would have seen before this time that they are not obeying the Word of the Lord. It has been presented to me that were they to connect with the Sanitarium as they now are, their influence would not leave a right impression on the minds of those with whom they would be brought in contact. Their ideas regarding Christian deportment are not correct. They would not honor the Lord. They both need to be united with Christ. Until this union is formed, they could not be other than a great burden if brought into the Sanitarium. It will never do for them to be placed in connection with other workers unless they see and understand what it means to be chosen of God.",
