    "word": "Chap. 20 - On the Training of Medical Students \n\n     \"'We greatly need godly physicians. We need men who have high and holy principles. . . . \n                                                                           26\nI have been shown that young men will accept the responsibility of obtaining a medical education, and enter upon their course of study designing to be right and maintain their Christian principles; but do they do this? No; they fall into temptation, and evil influences affect their morals. Among our own people who profess to believe the most solemn truths ever committed to mortals, there is a tarnishing of virtue, a sacrificing of principle. They do not, like Joseph and Daniel, preserve their integrity of morals, much less their Christian principles. The habits and customs of associates who claim to be respectable men and women have a molding influence upon them. Not only the youth, but those of mature age, are inclined to conform to the worldlings' standard in order not to be considered singular.'",
