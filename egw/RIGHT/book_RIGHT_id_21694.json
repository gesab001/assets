    "word": "It is not outward show that makes the Christian. But it is the sanctifying power of the grace of God upon the soul. By their fruits ye shall know them. If a man is meek and Christlike, he will reflect this. If he is puffed up and thinks he knows it all, he takes the position that he does not need to learn in the school of Christ, and the very lessons he needs to learn he does not learn, [and] at last he is weighed in the balances and found wanting. It is too late then for wrongs to be righted. The day of probation was the time for him to learn these lessons. Now is the time to do God's will, and in seeking to conform your will to the will of God you will have that love for your fellow men that Christ had for you, and you will be indeed a light to the world.",
