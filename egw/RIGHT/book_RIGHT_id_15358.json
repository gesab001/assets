    "word": "As the work of God\u2019s people moves forward with sanctified, resistless energy, planting the standard of Christ\u2019s righteousness in the church, moved by a power from the throne of God, the great controversy will wax stronger and stronger, and will become more and more determined. Mind will be arrayed against mind, plans against plans, principles of heavenly origin against principles of Satan. Truth in its varied phases will be in conflict with error in its ever-varying, increasing forms, and which, if possible, will deceive the very elect.\u2014Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 406, 407.",
