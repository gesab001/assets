    "word": "I have felt anguish of soul as I have thus seen the true state of things. There are dishonest men in our churches, there are licentious men. There is declension in the place of constant advancement to a higher, holier standard. And there is little proper labor done by the ministers in the churches because many do not carry the burden of the souls for whom they labor. The truth has not sanctified their own hearts. O, there is need of most earnest, devoted, self-sacrificing labor,-- the preaching of the truth, preaching Christ, and living Christ. O that all our workers would be laborers together with God, not trifling with time, not trifling with sacred responsibilities, but representing Christ in all things, watching for souls as they that must give an account; day by day, hour by hour, living in the channel of light: in the churches, and among the people, in cities and villages, diffusing the light received from the Sun of Righteousness. In order to do this, they must devote much time to prayer. Brethren, be instant in prayer. When in society, when compelled to be among the frivolous, the careless and inconsiderate, dart up your petitions to heaven, that the God of all grace may \n\n\n                         - 26 - \n\nkeep your souls in the love of Christ. When the workers are thus connected with God, there will be continual growth in every church.",
