    "word": "Not every one that proclaimed the first and second angel's messages are to give the third, even after they fully embrace it, for some have been in many errors and delusions, (and they must have moved wrong in the first place, or God would not have given them up to such errors,) that they can but just save their own souls, and if they undertake to guide others, they will be the means of overthrowing them. But I saw that some who have formerly run deep into fanaticism would be the first now to run before God sends them, before they are purified from their past errors, and would have error mixed with the truth, and would feed the flock of God with it, and if suffered to go on, the flock would become sickly; and distraction and death would follow. I saw that they would have to be sifted and sifted, until they were freed from all their errors, or they never could enter the kingdom. I saw that the messengers could not have that confidence in the judgment and discernment of those who have been in errors and \n51\nfanaticism, that they could in those who have been in the truth, and have not been into extravagant errors. Many, also, are too apt to urge out into the field some who have but just confessed the present truth, and have much to learn and much to do before they can be right in the sight of God themselves, instead of pointing out the way to others.",
