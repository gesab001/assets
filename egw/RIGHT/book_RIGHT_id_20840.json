    "word": "Whenever the will of God is violated by nations or by individuals, a day of retribution comes, as surely as rivers that burst their banks carry devastation before them. \"He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase\" [Ecclesiastes 5:10]. God has spoken. Will you hear His voice? \"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever\" [Daniel 12:3].",
