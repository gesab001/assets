    "word": "Jesus lives; He has risen, He is risen, He is alive forevermore. Do not feel that you carry the load. It is true you wear the yoke, but whom are you yoked up with? No less a personage than your Redeemer. Satan will cast his hellish shadow athwart your pathway; you cannot expect anything else; but he cast the same dark shadow to the brightness of Christ. . . . Do not look at the discouragements; think of how precious is Jesus.",
