    "word": "Your letter written to us from Golden, while we were at Wallings Mills, with statements that you had not been situated so that you could cultivate domestic qualities, is not now before me. But your letter shows that you do not see the point. I saw that you did not love domestic duties, and both of you neglected to bear your share of these burdens in the different families where you made it your home. Your principal anxiety and interest was for yourselves, expecting others to be interested for you, others to care for you, while you care only for yourselves. While the families you visit fulfill the gospel requirement in adopting into their family the servants of Christ, and while the servants of Christ are entitled to their care and have a right to their tables and the privileges of their home, obligations are resting upon those who receive these privileges. The obligations are mutual upon both parties.",
