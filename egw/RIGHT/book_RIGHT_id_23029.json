    "word": "\"Be Ye Therefore Perfect\" \n\n     The Lord estimates as of supreme value the holiness of his people, and He permits reverses to come upon individuals, upon families, and upon churches, that his people may see their danger and humble their hearts before him in repentance. He will treat his backslidden ones with tenderness. He will speak pardon to them, and clothe them with the garments of Christ's righteousness. He will honor them with his presence.",
