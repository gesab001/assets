Some of the \n\n\n                              -44- \n\nministers and leaders in the Southern California Conference need to realize the necessity of counselling with their brethren who have been long in the work, and who have thus gained a valuable experience. Their disposition to shut themselves up to themselves, and to feel competent to plan and execute, according to their own judgment and preference, brings them into financial embarrassment. Then, when the embarrassment bears heavily upon them, they are tempted to think that the Union Conference or the General Conference should help them out. This independent way of working is not right, and should not be followed. The ministers and teachers in our Conferences are to work unitedly with their brethren of experience, asking them for advice, and paying heed to this advice.",
