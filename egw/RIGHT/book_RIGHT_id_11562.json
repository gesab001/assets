    "word": "The prophet Ezra, and faithful servants of the Jewish church, were astonished when the princes came to them, saying, \"The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations. And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this, should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? Wouldst not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping? O Lord God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we remain \n                                                                           71\nyet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses, for we cannot stand before thee because of this.\" Ezra 9:1, 13-15.",
