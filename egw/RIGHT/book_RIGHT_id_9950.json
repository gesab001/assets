    "word": "Christ Stands by the Side of Persecuted Saints \n\n\n     Never is the tempest-tried soul more dearly loved by his Saviour than when he is suffering reproach for the truth's sake. When for the truth's sake the believer stands at the bar of unrighteous tribunals, Christ stands by his side.  All the reproaches that fall upon the human believer fall upon Christ in the person of His saints. \"I will love him,\" said Christ, \"and will manifest myself to him\" (John 14:21). Christ is condemned over again in the person of His believing disciples.",
