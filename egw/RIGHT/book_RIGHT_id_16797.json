    "word": "The word of God is sufficient to enlighten the most beclouded mind, to be understood by those who have any wish to understand it. But notwithstanding all this some of those who profess to make the word of God their study, are found living in direct opposition to its plainest teachings. Then to leave men and women without excuse, God has given plain and pointed testimonies, bringing them to the word they have neglected to follow. Yet all the light is turned from by those who serve their own lusts, and they will not cease their course of sin, but continue to take pleasure in unrighteousness, in the face of the threatenings and vengeance of God against those who do such things.",
