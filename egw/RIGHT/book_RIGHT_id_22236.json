    "word": "Many who ought to obey their Captain's orders in this time of emergency are unfaithful. They cannot be depended upon in the day of peril. They begin to inquire and question and make propositions, when the foe is gaining every advantage. The only right thing to do is to obey the Captain's orders without question, not stopping to reason about the matter, or to make suggestions, or to quibble over some minor point. We see thousands upon the very brink of ruin, and prompt action and this alone will avail to save the souls of many.",
