    "word": "How shall a person be just with God? How shall the sinner be made righteous? It is only through Christ that we can be brought into harmony with God, with holiness; but how are we to come to Christ? Many are asking the same question as did the multitude on the day of Pentecost, when, convicted of sin, they cried out, \u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d The first word of Peter\u2019s answer was \u201cRepent\u201d (Acts 2:37, 38). At another time, shortly after, he said, \u201cRepent . . . , and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out\u201d (Acts 3:19).",
