When He desired a work done on the tabernacle, He said, \"See, I have called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship.\"--Letter 60, 1907.",
