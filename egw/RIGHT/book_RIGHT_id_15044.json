    "word": "\"Blessed are they which do hunger and \n thirst after righteousness: for they \n shall be filled.\" Matthew 5:6. \n\n\n     Righteousness is holiness, likeness to God, and \"God is love.\" 1 John 4:16. It is conformity to the law of God, for \"all Thy commandments are righteousness\" (Psalm 119:172), and \"love is the fulfilling of the law\" (Romans 13:10). Righteousness is love, and love is the light and the life of God. The righteousness of God is embodied in Christ. We receive righteousness by receiving Him.",
