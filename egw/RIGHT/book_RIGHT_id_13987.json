    "word": "Are you one that makes mistakes? Go to Jesus, and ask Him to forgive you, and then believe that He does. \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" [1 John 1:9]. Ask the Lord to pardon your errors, then rejoice in Him. It will not help you in the least to keep mourning over your defects. Say, \"Lord, I cast my helpless soul on Thee, \n                                                                           50\nand Thee alone. I will not worry, because Thou hast said, 'Ask, and ye shall receive.'\" Believe that you do receive. Believe that your Saviour is full of compassion, full of tender pity and love. Let not little mishaps trouble you. Small mistakes may be ordered by the Lord to save you from making larger mistakes.",
