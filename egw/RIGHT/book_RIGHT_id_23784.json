If they had just used the talent which God had given them to cultivate the beautiful land. Far ahead of what they have in Graysville, that land is. There may be some spots in Graysville; but it is far ahead of it, and cultivatable. It can be done. But there is the land that was just-well, indifferently cared for. If they had kept it up, they could have raised something; but let me tell you, it is no more use for you to talk about that school supporting itself because it has so much land. It cannot do it. We can in some way have that land prepared\u2014unless they have a sensible company that will take right hold and work earnestly to do those things\u2014but oh, my brethren, I want to tell you we each have our own peculiarities, and God fixes us so that we will not always have them, and we will have a change and mingle.",
