    "word": "Books Must Be Used.--The study of the sciences is not to be neglected. Books must be used for this purpose; but they should be in harmony with the Bible, for that is the standard. Books of this character should take the place of many of those now in the hands of the students. God is the author of science. Scientific research opens the mind to vast fields of thought and information, enabling us to see God through his created works. Ignorance may try to support skepticism by appeals to science; but instead of doing this, science contributes fresh evidences of the wisdom and power of God. Rightly understood, science and the written word agree, and each sheds light on the other. Together they lead us to God, by teaching us something of the wise and beneficent laws through which he works.--Sp. Test., pp. 56, 57.",
