    "word": "U. T.--May 19, '97 (H. L. para. 37) \n     The transgression of physical law is transgression of God's law. Our Creator is Jesus Christ. He is the author of the physical law as He is the author of the moral law. And the human being who is \n\n36 \n\ncareless and reckless of the habits and practices that concern his physical life and health, sins against God. God is not reverenced, respected, or recognized. This is shown by the injury done to the body in violation of physical law.  {TSDF 35.10}  \n                                                     C. O. L.--346 \n     Anything that lessens physical strength enfeebles the mind, and makes it less capable of discriminating between right and wrong. We become less capable of choosing the good, and have less strength of will to do that which we know to be right.",
