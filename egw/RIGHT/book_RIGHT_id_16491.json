    "word": "\"Except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,--the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name. The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul. He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Every man's work shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.",
