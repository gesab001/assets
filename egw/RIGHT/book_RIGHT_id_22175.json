    "word": "Brother Howard Miller, I have written a large letter to you and Brother Madison Miller but have not been able, because I was obliged to attend to so many things that were pressing upon my attention, to complete a copy for you both. I must say to you that as you now are blind spiritually you are not fitted to be a help to your brethren. When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. You will sow the seeds in your labor that you will not be pleased to harvest. Your spirit is not right with God. You feel that you are qualified to do a large work, but this is because you do not know \n                                                                           335\nyourself. I beseech of you to humble your heart before God and be converted. Said Christ, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" Do not try to help others when you are in darkness yourself, and need to see many things in altogether a different light. Pray much, humble yourself before God, for this is your only safety. \n                                                (Signed) Ellen G. White",
