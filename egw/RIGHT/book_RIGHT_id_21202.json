    "word": "This is the account of the vision. Some parts of it might have escaped my mind, but I have written all I could remember except the individuals' cases; I delivered them when with you, and you will remember them, no doubt. Now do, do stand in the liberty. Some of you I feel are free, and I hope if you are not all free you will rise now and lift up your heads and rejoice in God. Praise the Lord, dear children, as much as you please, for praise is comely for the upright. You have enough to praise Him for; He has redeemed you by His most precious blood, and is soon to save you with an everlasting salvation. Finally, brethren, be at peace among yourselves.--Ms 5a, 1850. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nFebruary 28, 1991. Entire Ms.",
