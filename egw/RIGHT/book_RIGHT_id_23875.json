    "word": "The Word of God is to be made our study book. But how can this be done is the question asked again and again by the teachers in our long established schools. Attempts to do this have been made; but there have been so many questions asked, so many council meetings held, so much effort that every difficulty be discerned, that the reformers have been handicapped, and some have ceased to urge the reforms. They have been unable to stem the current of inquiry and criticism. But if teachers had advanced step by step in the right way as light shone upon their pathway, following the great Leader, the difficulties would have vanished. The approval of God would have made them hopeful. Ministering angels would have co-operated with the human agents, and they would have received light, and grace, and courage, and gladness.",
