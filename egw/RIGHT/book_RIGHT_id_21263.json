    "word": "Everyone will be tested and tried in the very way that is the most trying. Men cannot trust to their own wisdom. Self-sufficiency, if indulged, will be their stumbling block. Self must die and not have a resurrection every other day. The words must be truly spoken, \"I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\" The \"I\" is a very hard personality to kill. \"I\" rises into life in full proportions if given the least opportunity or encouragement. Then, confident in their own supposed wisdom, men forsake the right way.",
