    "word": "The Lord has often made manifest in his providence that nothing less than revealed truth, the word of God, can reclaim man from sin or keep \n\n\n                        -24- \n\nhim from transgression. That word which reveals the guilt of sin, has a power upon the human heart to make man right and keep him so. The Lord has said that his work is to be studied and obeyed; it is to be brought into the practical life; that word is as inflexible as the character of God, --the same yesterday, today, and forever.",
