Nov. 20, 1889 \n\nDear Brethren and Sisters: \n\n\n     \"Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.\" (Psalms 97:11) The year 1889 is almost ended. Struggles, defeat and trials mark the history of our experience, but we have something beside this. We have had peace and joys and victories amid weakness. We have been made strong. With the advantages of the experiences of the year now about to close, are we not better prepared to enter upon the New Year? There have been discouragements but have we not learned better to trust God in the hard places?",
