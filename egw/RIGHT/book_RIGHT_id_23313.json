    "word": "A lady was passing by--one of our highest teachers in Battle Creek, and it was icy and she didn't know how to drive and neither did her husband, and the sleigh slipped and jerked the lines right out of their hands. \"Jump, jump,\" said the husband, and she jumped and was caught right on the side of the sleigh and (897) struck her head on the ice and the blood poured out of her ears and nose and eyes and they thought it would be impossible to save her, but we gathered her up and took her into the house. We said we will take care of her but it is a question of how long she can live. There must be no noise around anywhere. It may be possible we can save her life. The doctor was sent for and when he said, \"What are you doing?\" We said, giving her a hot foot bath right under the bed clothes. Well, he said, you know better than I, and he turned on his heel and walked off and that was the last we saw of the doctor. Well, we kept her for four weeks and we had all the roosters removed from the neighborhood and every bit of noise excluded. And we succeeded in saving her life. Five years later in passing a woman who looked like this same teacher, when she saw me she grasped me in her arms and said, \"You saved my life and the life of this child, the only child I have, and I feel so grateful whenever I hear the name of Ellen White mentioned.",
