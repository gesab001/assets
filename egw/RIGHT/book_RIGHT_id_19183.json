    "word": "There were those in New York City who had not the least foresight or judgment, who were not capable of taking care of themselves. Brother Wilcox was ready to advise you and lead you on to venture out and plan for you to advantage himself with the little means you had. He was poor and did not love to labor. Wished to obtain a living in an easy way without suffering much fatigue or hardship. Such men have no right to marry and have the charge of a family. If they choose to venture, they must bear it and suffer. Brother Wilcox has not been diligent and judicious, but has looked upon his brethren who were better situated than he in regard to the things of this world, and felt tried with them if they did not favor him and impart of their substance to him, when God did not require them to do this. He has been the instigator of much of the difficulty in New York. He has felt tried and had bitter feelings against Brother Andrew's family because they have not taken hold to help him and follow out the plans he has suggested. They had no confidence in his judgment or his diligence.",
