    "word": "The lives of medical missionaries should be in harmony with the name they bear. Their words and acts should be an interpretation of all that the name embraces. The world has a right to expect from those who claim to be medical missionaries a course of conduct corresponding to all that the name signifies. In this present life God's servants are to give to the world an example of the preparation that those must make who obtain eternal life. But many of those claiming to have advanced knowledge of the word of God have given to the world a sample of character that He cannot approve.",
