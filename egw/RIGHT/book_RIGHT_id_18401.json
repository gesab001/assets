    "word": "I am glad you are where you are. Do not become discouraged. Meet the people with a courageous front. Keep the eye steadily fixed on your Leader. Dark and cloudy faces will confront you, but the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness will melt away this feature, and you will have the victory in God. . . . Expect everything possible that God can give. Do not talk doubts; do not ponder doubts. God has a people true as steel to principle, but they are confused. They are walking like blind men. Help them, for Christ's sake, help them.--Letter 218, 1899, p. 4. (To Elder and Mrs. S. N. Haskell, Nov. 29, 1899.)",
