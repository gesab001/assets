    "word": "In our individual experience we need to learn the meaning of true sanctification, because we have laid our ways and our will upon God's altar to be purified and refined and ennobled. This is pure religion. I am instructed to \n\n\n                                 -34- \n\nkeep constantly before the people of God the divine favor to be obtained by seeking the Lord in faith and humility of soul. There is a deeper experience for each one of us to gain. If we will seek the Lord in humble confession of our sins, it will be seen by all that we are coming up on a higher platform. Our words and works will be of a character to reflect light. Selfishness will be extinguished, and nobility of soul will shine forth in works of righteousness. Oh, that every soul might look into the gospel mirror, and reflect the divine attributes there revealed!",
