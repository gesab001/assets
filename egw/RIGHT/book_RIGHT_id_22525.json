You place a wrong construction upon many things that your brethren do and say. Your feelings are injured, and you think that your motives are impugned, your most righteous actions misapprehended and condemned. This has been the case in a degree, but not to the extent to which you have thought it was so, and you long to withdraw from those who know you best. Here you make wrong calculations. Your brethren have had something to learn as well as yourself. Your character has not been faultless. Your plans and calculations have not been without mistakes. Can you not remember that your own course of action has been a source of pain and grief to others? You did not give that sympathy, that consideration and comfort and courage to one whom God had called and chosen that you should have given. His life was near its close, and his spirit was grieved and sad, his heart broken because of the lack of sympathy on the part of his brethren. Think of these things, for he deserved no such treatment at your hands. Think of the Son of God when you feel that you are abused, that treachery and faithlessness has shaken your confidence in your brethren. Was not Jesus betrayed by those to whom he had shown infinite regard? Let not Satan set things before you in a perverted light.",
