    "word": "Angels, as ministering spirits, are in the path where duty calls the heirs of salvation to travel, and God will protect them from all evil. But when Satan marked out a path of his own, suggesting that Christ should evidence His divine character, Christ had no right to walk in that way. He was to keep His feet in the path which the Lord had marked out. Thus Christ in His humanity gave an example of what man should do when tempted by Satan's suggestions. We are to remember what Christ our Head did, and never to accept a dare to prove the truth to men who are inspired by Satan to make proposals that God has not originated; for in this way Satan would lead us to step out of the path of God's providence, and place ourselves in a position where we might be worsted by the enemy and be overcome to our own hurt and to the injury of the cause of God.",
