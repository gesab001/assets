    "word": "This self-sufficiency, and this combativeness, and this selfishness and wilfulness that are indulged, separate the soul from Jesus. We want that this will, this strong purpose, be turned into the right channel. Brethren, we want to have a will that will be God's will. It is right for us to have a will and way, but it must be God's way and God's will. When the mind and will are turned into the right channel we shall have success.",
