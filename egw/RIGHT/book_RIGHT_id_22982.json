    "word": "Our camp meetings should have the labors of medical men. These should be men of wisdom and sound judgment, men who respect the ministry of the word, and who are not victims of unbelief. These men are the guardians of the health of the people, and they are to be recognized and respected. They should give instruction to the people in regard to dangers of intemperance. This evil must be more boldly met in the future than it has been in the past. Ministers and doctors should set forth the evils of intemperance. Both should work in the gospel in perfect harmony with power to condemn sin and exalt righteousness.",
