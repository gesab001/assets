    "word": "Satan has an intense hatred for Christ, and the purchase of His blood, and he works with all deceivableness of unrighteousness. He seeks by every artifice to enlist the young under his banner; and he uses them as his agents to suggest doubts of the Bible. When one seed of doubt is sown, Satan nourishes it until it produces an abundant harvest. If he can unsettle one youth in regard to the Scripture, that one will not cease to work until other minds are leavened with the same skepticism.",
