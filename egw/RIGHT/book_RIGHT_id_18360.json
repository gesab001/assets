    "word": "(Colorado,) Thursday, Aug. 7, 1873. I wrote five letters. . . . The clouds looked dark. My husband, Elder Canright, and Willie went for a load of wood. They had but just unhitched the horses after their return when it commenced raining, then hailing. We had both rain and hail in great quantities. The hail was as large as hazel nuts. The water rushed down from the mountain and came into our sleeping room close by the floor. Two were engaged in mopping and bailing up water with dust pan. The kitchen leaked and flooded the floor. The dining room leaked badly. This has been a broken day. . . .",
