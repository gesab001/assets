Now, I would like to know why we cannot be Christians when we have the Bible and the testimony which God has given us; why we cannot act upon it. It is discouraging to the very life and soul; and the very time when I should have been writing letters to Europe and persons in different places, I have been so oppressed and burdened that I could not write a word even to my own friends. I would use all my strength so that I could not write: I could only think of them and pray for them, and they have not had a line.",
