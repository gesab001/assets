    "word": "It has pleased the Lord to have select, representative men connected with the work as missionaries--men who have been tested and proved and tried. Often they have been in trying situations, and by earnest, frequent, and laborious examination of their own spirit, habits, temper, appetites, and practice, they have carefully and thoroughly investigated themselves. Just as a carpenter who, in erecting a building, inspects every piece of timber he puts in to see if any are weak or rotten, and as he discards all defective ones, so the human character should be carefully examined to see if it is becoming more and more like Christ Jesus--pure, peaceable, kind, full of goodness, love, and truth. Those who enter through the gates into the city must and will have a right to the tree of life. To them the promise is made, \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\"",
