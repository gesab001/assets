    "word": "Each man in this world is charged with his own salvation, which he is to gain through Christ. It is possible for him to do a work as enduring as eternity. If he loses his own soul, he will be charged also with the souls that might have been saved had he used aright his God-given talents. Had he complied with the conditions, had he acted his part by giving God's warning and invitation, had he shown a living interest in the work of God in behalf of the souls for whom Christ paid the price with His own blood, he would have been accounted a faithful steward. In proportion to his faithfulness in cooperating with God would have been his reward.",
