    "word": "In all lines of our work there is need of greater earnestness. Time is passing. God's servants are to be \"not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\" People need the truth, and by earnest, faithful effort it is to be communicated to them. Souls are to be sought for, prayed for, labored for. Earnest appeals are to be made. Fervent prayers are to be offered. Our tame, spiritless petitions are to be changed into petitions of intense earnestness. God's word declares: The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\" \n\n                                               -",
