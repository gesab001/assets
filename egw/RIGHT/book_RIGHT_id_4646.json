    "word": "The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord, Satan will work \u201cwith all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness;\u201d and they  that \u201creceived not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,\u201d will be left to receive \u201cstrong delusion, that they \n390\nshould believe a lie.\u201d [2 Thessalonians 2:9-11.] Not until this condition shall be reached, and the union of the church with the world shall be fully accomplished, throughout Christendom, will the fall of Babylon be complete. The change is a progressive one, and the perfect fulfillment of Revelation 14:8 is yet future.",
