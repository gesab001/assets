    "word": "Those who are daily learning of Christ will become so meek and lowly that Christ can lead them. He will go before them, as their righteousness. As they follow in His footsteps, fulfilling His requirements, many will take knowledge of them that they have been with Christ. Their lives are conformed to the truth, and as they reveal the Saviour's character in their lives, they are doing the work that He did. As they behold Christ, they are changed from glory to glory, from character to character. Such believers will move the world. Let us strive for Christ's peace and gentleness, that it may be said of us as it was said of Him, \"Thy gentleness hath made me great.\"--Ms 44, 1901. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. December 5, 1985. Entire document.",
