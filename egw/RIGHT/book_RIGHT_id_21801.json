    "word": "To take people right where they are, whatever their position, whatever their condition, and help them in every way possible, this is ministry. It may be necessary for ministers to go into the homes of the sick, and say, I am ready to help you and I will do the best I can. I am not a physician, but I am a minister, and I like to minister to the sick and afflicted. Those who are sick in body are nearly always sick in soul, and when the soul is sick, the body is made sick.",
