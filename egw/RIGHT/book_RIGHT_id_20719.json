    "word": "I was much pleased to read just at this time, the piece in Review upon diet. [\"CHEAP AND GOOD FOOD,\" ADVENT REVIEW AND SABBATH HERALD, FEB. 12, 1884.] It came in just the right time for me, for I am laboring on this point and needed just what is there published. Well, this must go to the mail. When you can find time, write me, both of you. I will be very glad to hear from you. Love to Anna. May the Lord give her a precious experience in His service and may the younger children learn in the school of Christ to be children of Jesus Christ, is my sincere desire and prayer. In much love.",
