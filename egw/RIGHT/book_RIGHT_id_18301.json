    "word": "We are God's great building. Every stroke, every stone put into the building is only a part of the whole. Every worker is himself to become just \n\n\n                                   -340- \n\nwhat God designs he should be in building his own life with pure, noble, upright deeds, that at the end he may be a symmetrical structure, a fair temple, honored by God and man. God must be in this work. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" Through you He has worked, and will work to do honor to His name by trusting to you these great responsibilities. \"We are laborers together with God,\" and God would use you and me and each individual who engages in His service. Each is to stand upon his watchtower and listen attentively to that which the Spirit has to say to him, for every word and act leaves an impress not only on our characters, but upon the characters of others engaged in the work.",
