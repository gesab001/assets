    "word": "Every converted soul has a work to do. We are to receive grace in order to freely give grace. We are to let the light shine forth from the bright and morning star, to shed forth light in works of self-denial and self-sacrifice, following the example that Christ has given us in His own life and character. We are to draw from the root that substance that will enable us to bear much fruit. Every soul who has heard the divine invitation is to echo the message from hill to valley, saying to those with whom he comes in contact, \"Come.\" . . .",
