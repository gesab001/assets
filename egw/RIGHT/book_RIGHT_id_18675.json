    "word": "We returned to rest, but we could not sleep. We were too happy for sleep. We praised our Saviour nearly all night. There was not much sleeping done in the house that night. God had come with His holy presence into the house, and His sanctifying presence was too highly prized to sleep over the hours to us so precious. We have been very happy ever since. Peace and joy have flowed in upon our souls like a river. There has been uninterrupted peace and rest in the dear Saviour. Such an assurance as we are having is worth more than riches or gold, honor or worldly glory. I prize it! I prize it! The praise of God has been in our hearts, and upon our lips continually since that good evening. My peace is like a river and the righteousness thereof like the waves of the sea.--Letter 11, 1877, pp. 1, 2. (To \"Dear Children,\" August 31, 1877.)",
