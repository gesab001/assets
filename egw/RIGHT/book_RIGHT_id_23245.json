    "word": "One night I was awakened and instructed to write a straight testimony regarding the work of our school at Loma Linda. By that \n\n\n                              -379- \n\nschool a solemn and sacred work was to be done. The teachings of health reform were to stand out clearly and brightly that all youth in attendance might learn to practice them. All our educators should be strict health reformers. The Lord desires that genuine missionaries shall go out as pioneers from our schools. They are to be fully consecrated to the work, as laborers together with God daily enlarging their sphere of usefulness, and becoming more fully sanctified through the truth. The influence of a consecrated medical missionary teacher in our schools is invaluable.",
