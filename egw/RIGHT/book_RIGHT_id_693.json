    "word": "After slaying the Egyptian, he saw that he had not understood God\u2019s plan, and he fled from Egypt and became a shepherd. He was no longer planning to do a great work, but he became very humble; the mists that were beclouding his mind were expelled, and he disciplined his mind to seek after God as his refuge.

God was his refuge; God was his dwelling place, his home. . . .",
