    "word": "The church cannot grow in the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ until its members enter into the spirit of the work. Let no one make the defection of another one an excuse for not engaging in the work. We have not a moment to lose in looking to others, but should be engaged in the service of Christ. Because some who name the name of Christ walk unworthy of their calling, it is all the more necessary that we seek to shun every evil habit, to put away everything that will weaken our influence and cause others to make us an excuse for not doing the work that God requires. In every duty, whether temporal or spiritual, we have a relation one to another. He who neglects the least duty in the Lord's moral vineyard will be registered as lacking in the books of heaven, weighed in the balances of the sanctuary, and found wanting. God has given to every man his work, and he who neglects his work inflicts injury on the cause of Christ. We are to be followers of that which is good, to show ourselves approved unto God, workmen that need not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. This is applicable, not only to ministers who preach the word, but to every soul who believes in Christ.",
