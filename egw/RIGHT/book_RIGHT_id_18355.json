    "word": "Friday, Jan. 24, 1868. Prepared to go to Wright. We found it very unpleasant traveling. A cold wind was blowing directly in our faces. At noon stopped at Lappinville. Found ourselves in mean quarters; there was a woman with a pipe in her mouth, and a young man smoking a cigar. He said . . . he had learned the habit and could not give it up now although he knew it was hurtful. . . . We ate our plain hygienic food with good relish, but were treated with incivility by the inmates of the house. They showed themselves strangers to true politeness.",
