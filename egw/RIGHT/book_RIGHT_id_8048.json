    "word": "The divine Worker spends little time on worthless material. Only the precious jewels does He polish after the similitude of a palace, cutting away all the rough edges. This process is severe and trying; it hurts human pride. Christ cuts deep into the experience that man in his self-sufficiency has regarded as complete, and takes away self-uplifting from the character. He cuts away the surplus surface, and putting the stone to the polishing wheel, presses it close, that all roughness may be worn away. Then, holding the jewel up to the light, the Master sees in it a reflection of Himself, and He pronounces it worthy of a place in His casket. \"In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee,... and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Blessed be the experience, however severe, that gives new value to the stone, and causes it to shine with living brightness.",
