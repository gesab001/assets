    "word": "To those who lift themselves up in exaltation, supposing that anything they may choose to do is right, the caution comes, \"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise\" [verse 18]. Let not his soul be puffed up with self-conceit, for he is but a man. He is not God. He is not to suppose that he is a foundation upon which other men are to build. There is danger here, and I am instructed to say, Take heed. All ye are brethren. \"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness\" [verse 19].",
