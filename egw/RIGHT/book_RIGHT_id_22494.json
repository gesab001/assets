    "word": "The institutions in our midst have all been founded in sacrifice. They belong to the people, and every soul who has denied self and made sacrifices to bring these institutions into existence should feel that he has a special interest in them. He should not lose his interest or faith, or cease to pray for them. Those who have sacrificed for these institutions should not submit to see them demoralized. They have a right to investigate. As the perils of the last days are upon us, they should pray more earnestly.",
