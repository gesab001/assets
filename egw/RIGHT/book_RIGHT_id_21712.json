    "word": "One reason why efforts have not heretofore been made for the higher classes as I have presented before you, is a lack of faith and real courage in God. It is not always best to labor for the most wealthy; these are sometimes the most ignorant, and they have made this world their God, so that it would be very difficult to introduce the wedge of truth and separate them from the world. Nevertheless, there are men of wealth who will embrace the truth here in Europe if the right kind of labor is put forth. The Lord has agents here whom He has trusted with means to carry forward His work in these countries. When those who are poor embrace the truth and do to the very best of their ability, our heavenly Father will see when they have gone to the extent of their ability, and He will bring in other talents in order to carry forward His work. There is a wonderful work to be done for the Master yet, and we want to act like living soldiers of the cross of Christ.",
