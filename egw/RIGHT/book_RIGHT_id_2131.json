    "word": "In the name of Christ I would address His professed followers: Abide in the faith which you have received from the beginning. \"Shun profane and vain babblings.\" 2 Timothy 2:16. Instead of putting your trust in witchcraft, have faith in the living God. Cursed is the path that leads to Endor or to Ekron. The feet will stumble and fall that venture upon this forbidden ground. There is a God in Israel, with whom is deliverance for all who are oppressed. Righteousness is the foundation of His throne.",
