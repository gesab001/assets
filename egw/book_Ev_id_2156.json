{"word": "A Message of Commendation.--I am very thankful to our gracious heavenly Father that He has given you strength through His imparted grace to cut yourself loose from the Free Mason lodge and all that relates to the society. It was not safe for you to have any part with this secret order. Those who stand under the blood-stained banner of Prince Immanuel cannot be united with the Free Masons or with any secret organization. The seal of the living God will not be placed upon anyone who maintains such a connection after the light of truth has shone upon his pathway. Christ is not divided, and Christians cannot serve God and mammon. The Lord says, \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and My daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\"--Letter 21, 1893.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 622}
