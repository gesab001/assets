{"word": "Section Eighteen - Extent of the Work\n\n                       Co-workers With Christ \n\n     One who believes in Jesus Christ as a personal Saviour is to be a co-worker with Him, bound up with His heart of infinite love, cooperating with Him in works of self-denial and benevolence. He to whom Christ has revealed His pardoning grace will, in practicing the works of Christ, find himself linked up with Christ. God calls upon those for whom He has made such an infinite sacrifice, to take their position as laborers together with Him in developing the gracious operations of God's divine benevolence.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 315}
