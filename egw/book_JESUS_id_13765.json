{"word": "Satan and his angels had enjoyed a little moment of triumph that their power over fallen man had caused the Lord of life to be laid in the grave; but short was their hellish triumph. For as Jesus walked forth from his prison house a majestic conqueror, Satan knew that after a season he must die, and his kingdom pass unto him whose right it was. He lamented and raged that notwithstanding all his efforts and power, Jesus had not been overcome, but had laid open a way of salvation for man, and whosoever would, might walk in it and be saved.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SG", "page": 67}
