{"word": "Now Jesus rested from the work of redemption; and though there was grief among those who loved Him on earth, yet there was joy in heaven. Glorious to the eyes of heavenly beings was the promise of the future. . . .With this scene the day upon which Jesus rested is forever linked. For \\93his work is perfect\\94 (Deuteronomy 32:4); and \\93whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever\\94 (Ecclesiastes 3:14). When there shall be a \\93restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began\\94 (Acts 3:21), the creation Sabbath, the day on which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph\\92s tomb, will still be a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven and earth will unite in praise, as \\93from one sabbath to another\\94 (Isaiah 66:23) the nations of the saved shall bow in joyful worship to God and the Lamb.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 162}
