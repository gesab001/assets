    "word": "Selfishness, which manifests itself in a variety of ways according to circumstances and the peculiar organization of individuals, must die. If you had children, and your mind were compelled to be called away from yourself to care for them, to instruct them, and be an example to them, it would be an advantage to you. You have called forth in your home the attention and forbearance which are required to be exercised toward children. This attention you require and will have. But you have not thought it any part of your duty to care for, or seek to advantage, others. You are willful and very \n                                                                           231\nset to carry out your own plans. When everything is smooth in your pathway, you manifest the fruits we expect to see borne by a Christian; but when your path is crossed, the result is the opposite. Like a spoiled child which deserves chastisement, you have a spell of perverse willfulness. When two compose a family, as in your case, and there are no children to call into exercise patience, forbearance, and true love, there is need of constant watchfulness lest selfishness obtain the supremacy, lest you yourselves become the center, and you require attention, care, and interest, which you feel under no obligation to bestow upon others. The care of children in a family makes it necessary that a large portion of the time be spent at home, giving opportunity for the culture of mind and heart in connection with the ordinary cares of domestic life.",
