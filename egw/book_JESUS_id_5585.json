{"word": "Cease to cherish and excuse sin; for sin caused the death of the Son of God. Let your conversation be in heaven, \\93from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.\\94 [Philippians 3:20.] Never forget, wherever your lot may be cast, that you are pilgrims and strangers here, journeying to a better country, even a heavenly. The talents you possess, the property God has lent you, must be used in doing good, in laying up treasure in heaven. The work which you are doing with your hand or your brain, must stand the test of the Judgment. How will it then appear? Are you acting well your part in preparing yourselves and others for glory, honor, and immortality? Are you doing anything that you will wish undone when the books shall be opened, and you meet your deeds as they stand registered in heaven?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 466}
