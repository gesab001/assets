{"word": "Oh, what a field of usefulness is opened before the medical missionary! Jesus Christ was in every sense of the word a missionary of the highest type, and combined with His missionary work that of the Great Physician, healing all manner of diseases. Many in Christ's day refused to be convinced of their lost condition. When Christ was in their midst as a mighty healer of bodily woe as well as the maladies of the sin-sick soul, some would not come unto Him that they might have life. They refused to be illuminated. So it will be in our day. Some will not be healed of their soul diseases.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 535}
