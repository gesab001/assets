{"word": "Courage and Perseverance in the Ministry\n     When Jesus sent his disciples forth to labor, he sent them two and two, that they might be a help and strength to each other, and stand more courageously in defense of truth. They did not feel as some do now, that they would rather work alone than have any one with them who did not labor just as they labored. Our Saviour understood what ones to associate together. He did not connect with the mild, beloved John one of the same temperament; but he connected with him the ardent, impulsive Peter. These two men were not alike either in their disposition or in their manner of labor. Peter was prompt and zealous in action, bold and uncompromising, and would often wound; John was ever calm, and considerate of others\\92 feelings, and would come after to bind up and encourage. Thus the defects in one were partially covered by the virtues in the other.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 126}
