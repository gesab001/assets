{"word": "Develop the Local Talent.--Do the work of an evangelist--water and cultivate the seed already sown. When a new church has been raised up, it should not be left destitute of help. The minister should develop the talent in the church, that meetings may be profitably kept up. Timothy was commanded to go from church to church, as one who should do this kind of work, and build up the churches in the most holy faith. He was to do the work of an evangelist, and this is an even more important work than that of the ministers. He was to preach the Word, but he was not to be settled over one church.--Review and Herald, Sept. 28, 1897.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 337}
