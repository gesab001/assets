{"word": "Faithful stewards are needed. God will work with everyone who will be worked. The Holy Spirit will lead many souls to Christ. In His companionship they will be fitted for the courts above. Those who are laborers together with God will become wise in soul saving. They will learn of the great Teacher, and while they are presenting Bible subjects to those they are trying to help, the grace of Christ will fill their hearts, and the Word of God will unfold before them. While they are sounding the call, \"Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely\" (Revelation 22:17), their own thirst will be quenched.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 229}
