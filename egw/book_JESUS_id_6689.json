{"word": "The most difficult sermon to preach and the hardest to practice is self-denial. The greedy sinner, self, closes the door to the good which might be done but which is not done because shillings and pounds [WRITTEN IN AUSTRALIA WHEN THESE WERE STANDARD MONETARY UNITS] are invested in selfish purposes. We may never have opportunity to do great things; we may never be required to make sublime sacrifices. But the greatest victory we can gain is to follow Jesus. . . . Every day that Christ lived in our world was for Him a day of self-denial. If we would follow Him over the rugged path of self-denial . . . this denial must be carried into the everyday occurrences and actions of our life. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 300}
