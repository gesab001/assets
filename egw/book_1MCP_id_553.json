{"word": "Preoccupation of Mind Rules Out Low Thoughts. --Educate the faculties and tastes of your dear ones; seek to preoccupy their minds so that there shall be no place for low, debasing thoughts or indulgences. The grace of Christ is the only antidote or preventive of evil. You may choose, if you will, whether the minds of your children shall be occupied with pure, uncorrupted thoughts or with the evils that are existing everywhere-- pride and forgetfulness of their Redeemer.--Lt 27, 1890. (CG 188.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 172}
