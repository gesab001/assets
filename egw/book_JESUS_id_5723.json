{"word": "The Lord has a work for women as well as men to do. They may accomplish a good work for God if they will first learn in the school of Christ the precious, all-important lessons of meekness. They must not only bear the name of Christ, but possess His Spirit. They must walk even as He walked, purifying their souls from everything that defiles. Then they will be able to benefit others by presenting the all-sufficiency of Jesus.--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. VI, page 117. \n\n[454]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW", "page": 453}
