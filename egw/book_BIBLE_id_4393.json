{"word": "The Bible and the Bible only is to be our refuge. God is in His Word. \"He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.\" That is enough for us. \"By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities\" (Isaiah 53:11). If the great and loving heart of God is satisfied with the result of His mission in the souls saved, let us rejoice. Let us work as we have never done before. Let us put self aside and lay hold of Jesus Christ by faith. Let us reveal Him to the world as the One altogether lovely and the chiefest among ten thousand.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 342}
