    "word": "A Solemn Warning \n[READ TO THE REVIEW AND HERALD BOARD IN NOVEMBER, 1901.]\nTo the Managers of the Review and Herald-- \n\n\n     Dear Brethren: God's design in the establishment of the publishing house at Battle Creek was that from it light should shine forth as a lamp that burneth. This has been kept before the managers. Again and again they have been told of the sacredness of God's office of publication and of the importance of maintaining its purity. But they have lost true understanding and have united with the force of the enemy by consenting to print papers and books containing the most dangerous errors that can be brought into existence. They have failed to see the evil influences of such erroneous sentiments on typesetters, proofreaders, and all others engaged in the printing of such matter. They have been spiritually asleep.",
