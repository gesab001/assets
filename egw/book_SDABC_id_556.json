    "word": "Chapter 3 \n\n     2. A Temporary Place of Worship Should Have Been Prepared.-- Solomon. . . knew that it would take much time to carry out the grand designs given for the building of the temple; and before building the house of the Lord or the walls about Jerusalem, he should have prepared a temporary place of worship for the people of God. He should not have encouraged them, by his own example, to go to the high places to offer sacrifice. But we read, \"Only the people of Israel sacrificed in high places.\" This is mentioned as a matter that should have been otherwise.",
