THE REFORM IN THIS PHASE OF HEALTHFUL LIVING WAS PROGRESSIVE. IN THE OLDER INSTITUTIONS, AFTER A LONG STRUGGLE, FLESH MEAT WAS EVENTUALLY DISCARDED FROM ALL TABLES. IN THE CASE OF THE BATTLE CREEK SANITARIUM THIS STEP WAS TAKEN IN 1898, LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO COUNSEL FROM MRS. WHITE'S PEN APPEARING IN THIS CHAPTER (722). AT THE ST. HELENA SANITARIUM THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN 1903. BY THIS TIME EDUCATION IN THE MATTER OF A NONFLESH DIET HAD SPREAD WIDELY, AND FLESH WAS LEFT OUT OF THE DIETARY OF THE GUESTS WITH LESS DIFFICULTY THAN IF IT HAD BEEN EXCLUDED AT AN EARLIER DATE. IT WAS A JOY TO THE MANAGERS OF THE OLDER INSTITUTIONS TO KNOW THAT IN THE NEW PLANTS OPENED AT ABOUT THIS TIME, FLESH FOOD WAS NOT SERVED TO THE PATIENTS.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 405}
