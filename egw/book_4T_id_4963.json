    "word": "Chap. 6 - True Benevolence\n\n     Dear Brother and Sister F: I will now try to write what has been presented before me in regard to you; for I feel that it is time for this church to get their hearts in order and make diligent work for eternity.

I was shown that you would be placed in circumstances where you would be tried and tested, and that traits of character would be revealed which you were not aware that you possessed.",
