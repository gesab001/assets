    "word": "This parable correctly represents the condition of many professing to believe the present truth. The Lord has sent them an invitation to come to the supper which He has \n                                                                           384\nprepared for them at great cost to Himself; but worldly interests look to them of greater importance than the heavenly treasure. They are invited to take part in things of eternal value; but their farms, their cattle, and their home interests seem of so much greater importance than obedience to the heavenly invitation that they overpower every divine attraction, and these earthly things are made the excuse for their disobedience to the heavenly command, \"Come; for all things are now ready.\" These brethren are blindly following the example of those represented in the parable. They look at their worldly possessions, and say: No, Lord, I cannot follow Thee; \"I pray Thee have me excused.\"",
