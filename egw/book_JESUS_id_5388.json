{"word": "A Personal Faith in Christ Our Greatest Need\n     \\93Ye shall be witnesses unto me.\\94 [Acts 1:8] These words of Jesus have lost none of their force. Our Saviour calls for faithful witnesses in these days of religious formalism. But how few, even among the professed ambassadors for Christ, are ready to give a faithful, personal testimony for their Master. Many can tell what the great and good men of generations past have done, and dared, and suffered, and enjoyed. They become eloquent in setting forth the power of the gospel, which has enabled others to rejoice in trying conflicts and to stand firm against fierce temptations. But while so earnest in bringing forward other Christians as witnesses for Jesus, they \n103\nseem to have no fresh, timely experience of their own to relate.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 102}
