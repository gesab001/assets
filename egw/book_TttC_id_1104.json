    "word": "Preachers have been regarded by some as especially inspired, as being only mediums for the Lord to speak through. If the aged and those of long experience see failings in a minister and suggest improvements in his manners, in the tone of \n                                                                           445\nhis voice, or in his gestures, he has sometimes felt hurt, and has reasoned that God called him just as he was, that the power was of God and not of himself, and that God must do the work for him, that he did not preach according to man's wisdom, etc. It is a mistake to think that a man cannot preach unless he becomes wrought up to a high degree of excitement. Men who are thus dependent upon feeling may be of use in exhortation when they feel just like it; but they will never make good, burden-bearing laborers. When the work moves hard and everything assumes a discouraging aspect, the excitable and those dependent upon feeling are not prepared to bear their share of the burdens. In times of discouragement and darkness how important to have calm-thinking men, who are not dependent on circumstances, but who trust God and labor on in the darkness as well as in the light. Men who serve God from principle, although their faith may be severely tried, will be seen leaning securely upon the never-failing arm of Jehovah.",
