    "word": "Knowledge of useful labor will impart to your restless and dissatisfied mind energy, efficiency, and a becoming, modest dignity, which will command respect. You know but very little of yourself; you know not the deceptions of your own heart. The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.

Unless you see the defects in your character and with genuine sincerity correct your errors, you cannot be a disciple of Christ. \n                                                                           337",
