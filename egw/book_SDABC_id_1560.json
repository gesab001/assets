How to Know a False Christ.--We need to be anchored in Christ, rooted and grounded in the faith. Satan works through agents. He selects those who have not been drinking of the living waters, whose souls are athirst for something new and strange, and who are ever ready to drink at any fountain that may present itself. Voices will be heard, saying, \"Lo, here is Christ,\" or \"Lo, there;\" but we must believe them not. We have unmistakable evidence of the voice of the True Shepherd, and He is calling upon us to follow Him. He says, \"I have kept my Father's commandments.\" He leads His sheep in the path of humble obedience to the law of God, but He never encourages them in the transgression of that law.",
