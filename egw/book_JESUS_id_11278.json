{"word": "Jesus has raised His voice in warning: \"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits\" (Matthew 7:15, 16). \"Thus saith the Lord of hosts, hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord\" (Jeremiah 23:16). \"If any man shall say to you, Lo here is Christ, or lo, he is there, believe him not; for false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. But take ye heed; behold, I have foretold you all things\" (Mark 13:21-23).--Letter 6a, 1894.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 341}
