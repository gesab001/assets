A heavenly smile was upon his countenance, and those lips, a few moments before stained with blood, were opened to praise God for his great salvation. As the minister left the room he said to my parents, \"That is a triumphant soul; I never saw so happy a soul before.\" Soon after this my brother fell asleep in Jesus, in full hope of having a part in the first resurrection. The following lines were written upon his death by Sr. Annie R. Smith: \n\n\n     He sleeps in Jesus--peaceful rest-- \n     No mortal strife invades, his breast; \n     No pain, or sin, or woe, or care, \n     Can reach the silent slumberer there. \n\n\n     He lived, his Saviour to adore, \n     And meekly all his sufferings bore. \n     He loved, and all resigned to God; \n     Nor murmured at his chastening rod. \n                                                                           165\n\n     \"Does earth attract thee here?\" they cried, \n     The dying Christian thus replied: \n     While pointing upward to the sky, \n     \"My treasure is laid up on high.\" \n\n\n     He sleeps in Jesus--soon to rise, \n     When the last trump shall rend the skies; \n     Then burst the fetters of the tomb, \n     To wake in full, immortal bloom. \n\n\n     He sleeps in Jesus--cease thy grief; \n     Let this afford thee sweet relief-- \n     That, freed from death's triumphant reign, \n     In heaven will he live again.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 164}
