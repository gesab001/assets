{"word": "Jesus descended upon a great and mighty mountain, which, as soon as His feet touched it, parted asunder, and became a mighty plain. Then we looked up and saw the \n123\ngreat and beautiful City, with twelve foundations, twelve gates, three on each side, and an angel at each gate. We cried out, The City! The great City! It is coming down from God out of heaven! And it came down in all its splendor, and dazzling glory, and settled in the mighty plain which Jesus had prepared for it.\\971SG 213.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 122}
