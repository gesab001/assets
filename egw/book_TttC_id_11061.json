    "word": "\"If thy brother shall trespass against thee,\" Christ declared, \"go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.\" Matthew 18:15. Do not tell others of the wrong. One person is told, then another, and still another; and continually the report grows, and the evil increases, till the whole church is made to suffer. Settle the matter \"between thee and him alone.\" This is God's plan. \"Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbor hath put thee to shame. Debate thy cause with thy neighbor himself; and discover not a secret to another.\" Proverbs 25:8, 9. Do not suffer sin upon your brother; but do not expose him, and thus increase the difficulty, \n                                                                           261\nmaking the reproof seem like a revenge. Correct him in the way outlined in the word of God.",
