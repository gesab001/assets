Enter into no controversy, and engage in no contention. [THIS COUNSEL ARRIVED ON THE DAY OUR LEADING MINISTERS IN NEW ZEALAND WERE PUBLICLY CHALLENGED TO A DEBATE. AT FIRST THEY THOUGHT THEY SHOULD ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE, BUT TURNED AWAY FROM IT AFTER READING THIS LETTER. FOR DETAILS, SEE AUSTRALASIAN UNION CONFERENCE RECORD, MARCH 15, 1903, OR S. R. GOLDSTONE, NOTHING TO FEAR, PP. 54-56. GOLDSTONE'S BOOK WAS PUBLISHED BY THE NORTH NEW ZEALAND CONFERENCE IN 1983.] Lift up the standard of truth; yes, lift it up. We have a Leader to whom has been promised all power--power against which the energies of earth and hell cannot prevail. Remember that the best way to combat error is to present truth.",
