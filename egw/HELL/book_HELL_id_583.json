    "word": "Christ Employed the Human Faculties to Comprehend Humanity.--Oh, what great privileges are granted to all who are not only professors, but doers of the words of Christ! The knowledge of Christ as the Sin-Bearer, the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, enables us to live a life of holiness. This is the only safeguard to preserve the happiness of the human family. Satan realizes that without this knowledge we should be thrown into confusion, divested of our strength, our faith weakened, and thus we should be deceived by every artifice he might choose to practice upon us. His plans have been wisely made to carry out his purpose to destroy man. He endeavors to throw his hellish shadow, like the pall of death, between God and man, that he may hide Jesus from our view, that we may forget His ministry of love and mercy, and that he may prevent further disclosures of God's great love and power to usward. He would intercept every ray of light from heaven. \n\n\n                                  -126-",
