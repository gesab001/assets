    "word": "\"Those who will study the manner of Christ's teaching and educate themselves to follow His way, will attract and hold large numbers now, as Christ held the people in His day. The Saviour is our example in all things. His love abiding in the heart will be expressed in words that will benefit the hearers, and win souls to Him. When the truth in its practical character is urged upon the people because you love them, souls will be convicted, because the Holy Spirit of God will convict of the truth. Satan will be on the ground, that with his hellish shadow he may obtrude himself between man and God, to intercept every ray of light that will shine on the soul. The great message is to be given as it is in Jesus.",
