    "word": "The word Peter signifies a stone--a rolling stone. Peter was not the rock upon which the church was founded. The gates of hell did prevail against him when he denied his Lord with cursing and swearing. The church was built upon One against whom the gates of hell could not prevail. . . . The church is built upon Christ as its foundation; it is to obey Christ as its head.",
