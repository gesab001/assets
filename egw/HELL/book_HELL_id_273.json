    "word": "\"In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\" Christ did not fail, neither was He discouraged, and His followers are to manifest a faith of the same enduring nature. . . . Though apparent impossibilities obstruct their way, by His grace they are to go forward. . . . They are to have power to resist evil, power that neither earth, nor death, nor hell can master, power that will enable them to overcome as Christ overcame. \n\n\n                        *     *     *     *     *",
