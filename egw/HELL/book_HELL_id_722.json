    "word": "The earth is corrupt and dark and idolatrous; but amid the darkness and corruption a pure, divine light, the Word of God, is shining. But although we have known the truth for many years, little advancement has been made by those who have been given light. Whose plan was it to produce that class of books that have been patronized in our schools? It was the plan largely of men who had not the experience of Moses and Joshua and Daniel, and the other prophets and apostle, who endured the seeing of Him who is invisible. Seeing God by faith given a conception of the divine character, the perfection of heaven. But to place in our schools the books that have been placed there as standard books, is an offense to God. In this age, as never before, when the two great forces of the Prince of Heaven and the prince of hell have met in decided conflict, our youth need instruction in Bible principles. Like the branches of the True Vine, the Word of God presents unity in diversity. There is in it a perfect, superhuman, mysterious unity. It contains divine wisdom that is the foundation of all true education; but this book has been treated indifferently.",
