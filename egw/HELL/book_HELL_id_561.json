    "word": "You complain of being treated coldly in Battle Creek. Did you go with a humble spirit to those who are spiritual and say, \"Will you examine the Scriptures with me? Shall we pray over this matter? I have not the light, I want it; for error will never sanctify the soul.\" Can you be surprised that they would not give you all that confidence you might think they should, after the experience they have passed through? Should not the words of Christ have any weight? \"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\" (Matthew 7:15). \"Lo here and lo there is Christ,\" will be multiplied. Let the believers heed the voice of the angel who has said to the church, \"Press together.\" In unity is your strength. Love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous. God hath a church, and Christ hath declared, \"The gates of hell shall not prevail against it\" (Matthew 16:18). The messengers the Lord sends bear the divine credentials. I have tender feelings toward you, but come to the light, I beseech of you.--Letter 16, 1893, pp. 1-7.
