    "word": "Present the Pledge \n\n     Ask those who attend the meetings to help you in the work that you are trying to do. Show them how evil habits result in diseased bodies and diseased minds,--in wretchedness, that no pen can described. The use of intoxicating liquor is robbing thousands of their reason. And yet the sale of this liquor is legalized by law. [Written in 1905.] Tell them that they have a heaven to win and a hell to shun. Ask them to sign the pledge. The commission of the great I AM is to be your authority. Have the pledges prepared, and present them at the close of the meeting.--MS-42-1905.",
