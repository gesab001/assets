    "word": "There is a heaven of bliss, free from all dissension, free from all selfishness, free from poverty, sickness, oppression. Then I entreat you who have a heaven to gain and a hell to shun, do not be presumptuous. Link up in the closest relationship with Christ, and depart from every species of iniquity. That character which expresses the glory, the character of Christ, will be received into the Paradise of God. A renovated race will walk with Christ in white, for they are worthy. The likeness of Christ's character is revealed in every soul. There is a new heaven, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. \n                                                                           1430\nO shall we not here form characters after the divine similitude? Shall we not become transformed into the likeness of God? If Christ died to destroy the work of the devil, it is essential for us to understand what these works are.",
