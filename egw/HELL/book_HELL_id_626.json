    "word": "Scenery viewed on Friday while nearing Ogden. At Green River is the place where specimens of fossils, petrifactions, and general natural curiosities are seen. Shells and wood in a petrified state can be purchased for a trifle. There is a high, projecting rock, in appearance like a tower, and there are twin rocks of gigantic proportions. The appearance of these rocks is as though some great temple once stood here and their massive pillars were left standing as witness of their former greatness.",
