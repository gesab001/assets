    "word": "How do fallen angels look upon this pure and uncontaminated One, the Prince of Life, through the different stages of His humiliation?

And every victory gained, how precious it is in behalf of the human family, exalting, elevating, ennobling the workmanship of God; and Satan has been at work for centuries, degrading, debasing, and prostituting all his powers to do his hellish work.",
