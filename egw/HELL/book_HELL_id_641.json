    "word": "Brethren and sisters, we had better come to our senses now, without delay. We had better cry for the vitalizing power of God to come upon us, and cure us of our spiritual paralysis. And, unless there is a thorough arousing, and you begin to cry unto God and change your course of action, you will be rated either with the unbeliever or you will be in that position that you have a name to live while you are dead; and your influence in the world is a living curse. Just because of your profession you lead people in the road to death and hell, and the account that God is to settle with you in the judgment you will not want the court to meet, for it decides your case forever.",
