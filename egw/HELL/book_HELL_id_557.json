    "word": "Bro. Bacheller, there is a lack with you, a neglect of your trust. You are not as faithful of your time and labor for the interest of the Association as is your duty. There is a great lack of devotion and consecration to God. You have been growing cold and careless in regard to your own salvation, and have not felt the moral obligations resting upon you to exemplify in your life the life of Christ. How have you let your light shine before the weak, and before unbelievers? Has it been such that they would be convinced that you were indeed a faithful servant of the cross of Christ? You have not shown the power of living faith and divine grace in your heart and life, and your lack of consecration unfits you for the sacred work in \n                                                                           32\nwhich you are engaged. Instead of overcoming the world, the flesh, and the devil, you are being overcome. A neglect to live up to the light you have had, has brought darkness and unbelief to your soul.",
