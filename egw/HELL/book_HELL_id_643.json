    "word": "Now I read some verses further than this: \"And now come I to Thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have\"--what?--\"My joy fulfilled in themselves.\" Well now, this is the privilege of every individual soul. The joy of Christ fulfilled in themselves. Think that this can be done; believe that it can be done. Act it; and you will find that you are brought into a purer atmosphere; you are breathing the atmosphere of heaven--not the atmosphere of hell, but the atmosphere of heaven--and when you breathe in that atmosphere, and this atmosphere surrounds the soul, all that come within the sphere of your influence are benefited and blessed.",
