    "word": "The last days are upon us, and Satan is working with all his hellish arts to deceive and destroy souls. Reproofs by testimony are met almost universally by the ones corrected and reproved, with, \"I believe the testimonies, but I do not understand them.\" The Lord has corrected their wrong ways in order to save them from unhappiness, \n\n\n                          [14] \n\ndeception, and ruin; but they pass on the same as if light and warnings had never come to them. If they were in harmony with God, they would not be departing from him. It is because they are so far separated from God that they do not hear his voice as he calls to them, \"Return unto me, and I will return unto you,\" \"and heal all thy backslidings.\"",
