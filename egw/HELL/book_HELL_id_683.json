Amid the dense darkness that covers the earth, every ray of light that has come from heaven must shine forth. The warnings and entreaties of the word of God and the fulfillment of prophecy in events daily taking place around us are but dimly comprehended by many who profess to believe the present truth. Satan would have men sleep, while he is actively at work sowing the seeds of error. Every eye in the unfallen universe is bent on the scenes unfolding before us, -- the final scenes of the great controversy, -- the consummation of the long struggle of evil against good, of hell with heaven. Satan with his miracle-working power is to deceive the world of the ungodly. But Christ, the atoning sacrifice, will be a refuge to every soul that trusts in Him. In the cleft of the Rock we may hide, secure from all the power and arts of the wicked one.",
