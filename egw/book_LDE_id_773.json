{"word": "Most Non-Adventists Will Reject the Warning \n\n     Many who hear the message--by far the greatest number--will not credit the solemn warning. Many will be found disloyal to the commandments of God, which are a test of character. The Lord's servants will be called enthusiasts. Ministers will warn the people not to listen to them. Noah received the same treatment while the Spirit of God was urging him to give the message, whether men would hear or whether they would forbear.--TM 233 (1895).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 210}
