{"word": "Then I was pointed to the glory of heaven, to the treasure laid up for the faithful. Every thing was lovely and glorious. The angels would sing a lovely song, then they would cease singing, and take their crowns from their heads and cast them glittering at the feet of the lovely Jesus, and with melodious voices cry, \\93Glory, Alleluia.\\94 I joined with them in their songs of praise and honor to the Lamb, and every time I opened my mouth to praise him, I felt an unutterable sense of glory that surrounded me. It was a far more, an exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Said the angel, \\93The little remnant who love God and keep his commandments, and are faithful to the end, will enjoy this glory, and ever be in the presence of Jesus, and sing with the holy angels.\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ExV", "page": 54}
