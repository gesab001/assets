{"word": "Chapter 2 \n\n     4 (Acts 5:31). Repentance the First Fruits of the Spirit's Working.--Repentance for sin is the first fruits of the working of the Holy Spirit in the life. It is the only process by which infinite purity reflects the image of Christ in His redeemed subjects. In Christ all fullness dwells. Science that is not in harmony with Him is of no value. He teaches us to count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord. This knowledge is the highest science that any man can reach (MS 28, 1905).", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1068}
