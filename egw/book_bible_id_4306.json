{"word": "Results of United Effort \n\n     Our work was not sustained by large gifts or legacies; for we have few wealthy men among us. What is the secret of our prosperity? We have moved under the orders of the Captain of our salvation. God has blessed our united efforts. The truth has spread and flourished. Institutions have multiplied. The mustard seed has grown to a great tree. The system of organization has proved a grand success. Systematic benevolence [SEE APPENDIX.] was entered into according to the Bible plan. The body has been \"compacted by that which every joint supplieth.\" As we have advanced, our system of organization has still proved effectual.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 27}
