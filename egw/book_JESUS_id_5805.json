{"word": "It was not the leaders in the church who had an understanding of this truth, and engaged in its proclamation. Had these been faithful watchmen, diligently and prayerfully searching the Scriptures, they would have known the time of night; the prophecies would have opened to them the events about to take place. But they did not occupy this position, and the message was given by another class. Said Jesus, \\93Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you.\\94 [John 12:35.] Those who turn away from the light which God has given, or who neglect to seek it when it is within their reach, are left in darkness. But the Saviour declares, \\93He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\\94 [John 8:12.] Whoever is with singleness of purpose seeking to do God's will, earnestly heeding the light already given, will receive greater light; to that soul some star of heavenly radiance will be sent, to guide him into all truth.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 312}
