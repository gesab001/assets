{"word": "A large portion of the time being spent in study should rather be spent in prayer and meditation.--I was shown that the time that is consumed in so much reading and study is often worse than thrown away. A large portion of the time spent over books and in studying should be spent before God imploring Him for heavenly wisdom and for strength and power to let the truth, which they do fully understand, shine out before the people in its clearness and harmonious beauty. There is too little time spent in secret prayer and in sacred meditation. The cry of God's servants should be for the holy unction and to be clothed with salvation, that what they preach may reach hearts. Time is so short and ministers of these last days are so few that they should throw all their energies into the work, and should be in close connection with God and holy angels, that a tremendous power may be in their preaching--a compelling power, to draw every soul who is honest and loves the truth right along to embrace it.--VSS 219.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 26}
