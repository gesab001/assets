{"word": "When errors arise and are taught as Bible truth, those who have a connection with Christ will not trust to what the minister says, but like the noble Bereans, they will search the Scriptures daily to see if these things are so. When they discover what is the word of the Lord, they will take their stand on the side of the truth. They will hear the voice of the True Shepherd saying, \"This is the way, walk ye in it.\" Thus you will be educated to make the Bible the man of your counsel, and the voice of a stranger you will neither hear nor follow.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 86}
