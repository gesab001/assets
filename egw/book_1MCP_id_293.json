{"word": "A New Heart Means a New Mind.--The words \"A new heart will I give you\" mean, \"A new mind will I give you.\" This change of heart is always attended by a clear conception of Christian duty, an understanding of truth.

He who gives the Scriptures close, prayerful attention will gain clear comprehension and sound judgment, as if in turning to God he had reached a higher grade of intelligence.-RH, Nov 10, 1904.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 95}
