    "word": "My husband came to the house after the forenoon meeting, saying that he had given an appointment for me to speak in \n                                                                           605\nthe afternoon. It seemed impossible for me to stand before the people. When my husband asked what subject I would speak upon, I could not gather or retain a sentence in my mind. But I thought: If God will have me speak, He will surely strengthen me; I will venture by faith; I can but fail. I staggered to the tent with a strangely confused brain, but told the preaching brethren on the stand that if they would sustain me by their prayers, I would speak. I stood before the people in faith, and in about five minutes my head and lungs were relieved, and without difficulty I spoke more than one hour to fifteen hundred eager listeners. After I ceased speaking, a sense of the goodness and mercy of God came over me, and I could not forbear rising again and relating my sickness and the blessing of God which had sustained me while speaking. Since that meeting my lungs have been greatly relieved, and I have been improving in health.",
