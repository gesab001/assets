{"word": "Solomon says, \"He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool;\" and there are hundreds of such to be found among professors of godliness. Says the apostle: \"We are not ignorant of his devices.\" Oh, what art, what skill, what cunning, is exercised to lead the professed followers of Christ to a union with the world by seeking for happiness in the amusements of the world, under the delusion that some good is to be gained!
