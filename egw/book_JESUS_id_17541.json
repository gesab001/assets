{"word": "We are ever to be thankful that Jesus has proved to us by actual life that we can keep the commandments of God, contradicting Satan\\92s falsehood that we cannot keep them. The great Teacher came to our world to stand at the head of humanity, to thus elevate and sanctify humanity by His holy obedience to all the requirements of God, showing it is possible to obey all the commandments of God. He has demonstrated that a lifelong obedience is possible. Thus He gives people to the world, as the Father gave the Son, to exemplify in their life the life of Christ.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 40}
