{"word": "Jesus, the world's Redeemer, knows all His children by name, and on those who believe shall come the glory of God. . . . Those who behold Jesus become changed to His image, become assimilated to His nature, and the glory of God that shines in the face of Jesus, is reflected in the lives of His followers. More and more the Christian is changed from glory to glory. . . . The more he looks on Christ, the more he loves and longs to look again, and the more light and love and glory he sees in Christ, the more his light increases. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 61}
