{"word": "You who love to speak of the faults of others, arouse, and look into your own hearts. Take your Bibles, and go to God in earnest prayer. Ask Him to teach you to know yourself, to understand your weakness, your sins and follies, in the light of eternity. Ask Him to show you yourself as you stand in the sight of Heaven. This is an individual work. . . . In humility send your petition to God, and do not rest day nor night until you can say, Hear what the Lord hath done for me--until you can bear a living testimony and tell of victories won.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 88}
