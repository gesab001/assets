    "word": "My brother, be kind, patient, forbearing. Remember that your wife accepted you as her husband, not that you might rule over her, but that you might be her helper. Never be overbearing and dictatorial. Do not exert your strong will power to compel your wife to do as you wish. Remember that she has a will and that she may wish to have her way as much as you wish to have yours. Remember, too, that you have the advantage of your wider experience. Be considerate and courteous. \"The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits.\" James 3:17. \n                                                                           49",
