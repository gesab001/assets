{"word": "Jesus was an earnest, constant worker. Never lived there among men another so weighted with responsibilities. Never another carried so heavy a burden of the world's sorrow and sin. Never another toiled with such self-consuming zeal for the good of men. Yet His life was a life of health. Physically as well as spiritually He was represented by the sacrificial lamb, \"without blemish and without spot.\" In body as in soul He was an example of what God designed all humanity to be through obedience to His laws. \n                                                                           132", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 131}
