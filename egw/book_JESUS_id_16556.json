{"word": "Believers are to shine as lights in the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. A church, separate and distinct from the world, is in the estimation of heaven the greatest object in all the earth. The members are pledged to be separate from the world, consecrating their service to one Master, Jesus Christ. They are to reveal that they have chosen Christ as their leader. The work in Cape Town is an important work and the church is to be as God designed it should be, a representative of God's family in another world.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 90}
