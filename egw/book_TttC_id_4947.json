    "word": "A young man came to Christ and said: \"Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\" Jesus bade him keep the commandments. He returned answer: Lord, \"All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?\" Jesus looked with love upon the young man, and faithfully pointed out to him his deficiency in keeping the commandments. He did not love his neighbor as himself. Christ showed him his true character. His selfish love of riches was a defect, which, if not removed, would debar him from heaven. \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me.\" Christ would have him understand that He required nothing of him more than He Himself had experienced. All He asked was that he should follow His example.",
