{"word": "Hereditary and Cultivated Tendencies Become Habits.--The great hereditary and cultivated tendency to evil with Judas was covetousness. And by practice this became a habit which he carried into all his trading. Christlike principles of uprightness and justice had no room in selling and buying. His economical habits developed into a parsimonious spirit and became a fatal snare. Gain was his measurement of a correct religious experience, and all true righteousness became subordinate to this. While he continued a disciple in outward form, while in the very personal presence of Christ, he appropriated to himself means that belonged to the Lord's treasury.--MS 28, 1897.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 598}
