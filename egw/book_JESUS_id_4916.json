{"word": "Jesus Christ is the knowledge of the Father, and Christ is our great teacher sent from God. Christ has declared in the sixth chapter of John that He is that bread sent down from heaven. \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" The disciples did not comprehend His words. Says Christ, \"It is the Spirit that \n                                                                           384\nquickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 383}
