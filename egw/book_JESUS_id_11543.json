{"word": "31 (Romans 2:4). Repentance the Gift of Christ.--[Acts 5:31 quoted.] Repentance is as much the gift of Christ as is forgiveness, and it cannot be found in the heart where Jesus has not been at work. We can no more repent without the Spirit of Christ to awaken the conscience than we can be pardoned without Christ. Christ draws the sinner by the exhibition of His love upon the cross, and this softens the heart, impresses the mind, and inspires contrition and repentance in the soul (RH April 1, 1890).", "paragraph": 8, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1056}
