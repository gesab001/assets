    "word": "Brother C has been occupying an unworthy position in standing as a prop for B. He has been mind for him, and has stood by to sustain and back him up. These two men are fanatics on the subject of health reform. Brother C knows much less than he thinks he does. He is deceived in himself. He is selfish and bigoted in carrying out his views; he is not teachable. He has not had a subdued will. He is not a man of humble mind. Such a man has no business to be a physician. He may have gained some little knowledge by reading, but \n                                                                           386\nthis is not enough. Experience is necessary. Our people are too few to be sacrificed so cheaply and ingloriously as to submit to being experimented upon by such men. Altogether too many precious ones would fall a sacrifice to their rigid views and notions before they would give up, confess their errors, and learn wisdom by experience.",
