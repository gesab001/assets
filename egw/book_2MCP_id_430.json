{"word": "No Time for Contention and Strife.--Men and women professing to serve the Lord are content to occupy their time and attention with matters of little importance. They are content to be at variance with one another. If they were consecrated to the work of the Master, they would not be striving and contending like a family of unruly children. Every hand would be engaged in service. Every one would be standing at his post of duty, working with heart and soul as a missionary of the cross of Christ. . . . The workers would carry with them into their service the prayers and sympathies of an awakened church. They would receive their directions from Christ and would find no time for contention or strife.--RH, Sept 10, 1903.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 498}
