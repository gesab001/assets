    "word": "\"I THOUGHT IN MY DREAM THAT I WAS IN MY NATIVE TOWN, AT THE FOOT OF A LONG SIDEHILL. I SPOKE WITH CONSIDERABLE EARNESTNESS AND SAID: 'OH, THAT I MIGHT FIND THAT ALL-HEALING FOUNTAIN!' I THOUGHT A BEAUTIFUL, WELL-DRESSED YOUNG MAN CAME ALONG AND SAID VERY PLEASANTLY: 'I WILL CONDUCT YOU TO THE SPRING.' HE LED THE WAY, AND I TRIED TO FOLLOW. WE WENT ALONG THE HILLSIDE, \n                                                                           603\nPASSING WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY THREE WET BOGGY PLACES, THROUGH WHICH SMALL STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER WERE FLOWING. THERE WAS NO WAY TO CROSS THESE ONLY BY WADING. HAVING ACCOMPLISHED THIS, WE CAME TO NICE, HARD GROUND AND A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A JOG IN THE BANK, AND A LARGE SPRING OF THE PUREST SPARKLING WATER WAS BOILING UP. A LARGE VAT WAS PLACED THERE, VERY MUCH LIKE THE PLUNGE TUB AT THE HEALTH INSTITUTE AT BATTLE CREEK. A PIPE WAS RUNNING FROM THE SPRING INTO ONE END OF THE VAT, AND THE WATER WAS OVERFLOWING AT THE OTHER. THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY, AND THE WATER SPARKLED IN ITS RAYS.",
