{"word": "Today He [Christ] is making an atonement for us before the Father. \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\" Pointing to the palms of His hands, pierced by the fury and prejudice of wicked men, He says of us, \"I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands\" [Isaiah 49:16]. The Father bows in recognition of the price paid for humanity, and the angels approach the cross of Calvary with reverence. What a sacrifice is this! Who can fathom it! It will take the whole of eternity for man to understand the plan of redemption. It will open to him line upon line, here a little and there a little.-- Manuscript 21, 1895.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "7ABC", "page": 481}
