    "word": "This strange fanaticism in Wisconsin grew out of the false theory of holiness, advocated by Brother K--a holiness not dependent upon the third angel's message, but outside of present truth. Sister G received this false theory from him, carried it out herself, and zealously taught it to others. This nearly destroyed her love for the sacred, important truths for this time, which, if she had loved and obeyed, would have proved an anchor to hold her upon the right foundation. But she, with many others, made this theory of holiness or consecration the one great thing, and the important truths of God's word were of but little consequence, \"if the heart was only right.\" And poor souls were left without an anchor, to be carried about by feeling, and Satan came in and controlled minds and gave impressions and feelings to suit himself. Reason and judgment were despised, and the cause of God was cruelly reproached.",
