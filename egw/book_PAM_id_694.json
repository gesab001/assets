{"word": "Ministers should see that their churches are given instruction in the conducting of Sabbath school.--Instruction in regard to conducting the Sabbath-school should, to a large degree, be given in the home churches; for the labor can be made more direct and the results will be more permanent if instruction is given at home. This work does not require the services of the ministers; they should be free to attend to the spiritual interests of the people. They are to teach others what to do. They must instruct the people as to how to come to the Lord and how to lead others to Him.--CSW 185.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 273}
