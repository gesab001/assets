{"word": "Tea, Coffee, and Flesh Meat Not to Be Prescribed \n\n                                     (1896) E. from U.T. 4, 5 \n     438. Physicians are not employed to prescribed a flesh diet for patients, for it is this kind of diet that has made them sick. Seek the Lord. When you find Him, you will be meek and lowly of heart. Individually, you will not subsist upon the flesh of dead animals, neither will you put one morsel in the mouths of your children. You will not prescribe flesh, tea, or coffee for your patients, but will give talks in the parlor showing the necessity of a simple diet. You will cut away injurious things from your bill of fare.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 294}
