    "word": "Chapter 16 \n\n     10, 11. David Accepted Humiliation as Necessary.--[2 Samuel 16:10, 11 quoted.] He [David] thus acknowledges, before his people and chief men, that this is the punishment God has brought upon him because of his sin, which has given the enemies of the Lord occasion to blaspheme; that the enraged Benjamite might be accomplishing his part of the punishment predicted, and that if he bore these things with humility, the Lord would lessen his affliction, and turn the curse of Shimei into a blessing. David does not manifest the spirit of an unconverted man. He shows that he has had an experience in the things of God. He manifests a disposition to receive correction from God, and, in confidence turns to Him as his only trust. God rewards David's humble trust in Him, by defeating the counsel of Ahithophel, and preserving his life (1SP 383).",
