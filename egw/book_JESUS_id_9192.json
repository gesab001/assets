{"word": "We are to be representatives of Christ, as Christ was a representative of the Father. We want to be able to attract souls to Jesus, to point them to the Lamb of Calvary, who taketh away the sin of the world. Christ does not clothe sin with His righteousness, but He removes the sin, and in its place He imputes His own righteousness. When your sin is cleansed, the righteousness of Christ goes before you, and the glory of the Lord is your rearward. Your influence will then be decidedly on the side of Christ; for \n302\ninstead of making self a center, you will make Christ a center, and will feel that you are a guardian of sacred trusts.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 301}
