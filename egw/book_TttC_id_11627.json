    "word": "God is to be recognized and honored by the people calling themselves Seventh-day Adventists. In the past the truth has, to the honor of God, been proclaimed with convincing power by the physicians and helpers in our sanitariums. God will accept no less of you, but will expect far more. You and your associates are to labor on in faith and firmness to prevent decline and to ensure progress. There must be no narrowing down of your work, no concealing of the principles of truth; there must be a widening of the base of operations. Many plants must be made in different places. There is need of more zeal, more faith, more influence, of more active, spirited workers.",
