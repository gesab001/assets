{"word": "With your Bibles open before you consult sanctified reason and a good conscience. Your heart must be moved, your soul touched, your reason and intellect awakened, by the Spirit of God; the holy principles laid down in His word will give light to the soul. I tell you, my brethren, our true source of wisdom and virtue and power is in the cross of Calvary. Christ is the Author and Finisher of our faith. He says, \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" Jesus is the only sure guarantee for intellectual success and advancement.--MS. 16, 1890.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 99}
