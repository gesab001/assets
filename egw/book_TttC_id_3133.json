    "word": "Those whom Brother D really desired to have come to Bordoville were those whom he considered the best of society, capable of exerting a good influence.

Such men of influence are in truth the salt of the earth. God would not be pleased to have them congregate together and narrow down their sphere of usefulness. Reliable men are very scarce for the reason that the hearts of men are so devoted to their own selfish interests that they know no other.",
