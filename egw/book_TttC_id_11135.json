    "word": "Unwise Changes \n\n     Many changes are made that might better never be made. Often, when workers become discontented, instead of being encouraged to stay where they are and make a success of their work, they are sent to another place. But they take with them the same traits of character that in the past have marred their work. They will manifest the same un-Christlike spirit, for they have not learned the lesson of patient, humble service.",
