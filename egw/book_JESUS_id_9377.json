{"word": "God permits every person to exercise his individuality. No human mind should be submerged in another human mind. But the invitation has been given, \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.\" Each person is to stand before God with an individual faith, an individual experience, knowing for himself that Christ is formed within, the hope of glory. For us to imitate the example of any man-- even a person who in our human judgment we might regard as nearly perfect in character--would be to put our trust in an imperfect, defective human being, who is unable to impart one jot or tittle of perfection to any other human being.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 108}
