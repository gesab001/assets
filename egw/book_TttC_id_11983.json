    "word": "His Providential Care \n\n     Our God has heaven and earth at His command, and He knows just what we need. We can see only a little way before us; \"but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\" Hebrews 4:13. \n                                                                           273\nAbove the distractions of the earth He sits enthroned; all things are open to His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He orders that which His providence sees best.",
