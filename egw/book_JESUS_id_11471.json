{"word": "20. Scenes to Be Repeated.--After speaking of the end of the world, Jesus comes back to Jerusalem, the city then sitting in pride and arrogance, and saying, \"I sit a queen, ... and shall see no sorrow.\" As His prophetic eye rested upon Jerusalem, He sees that as she was given up to destruction, the world will be given up to its doom. The scenes that transpired at the destruction of Jerusalem will be repeated at the great and terrible day of the Lord, but in a more fearful manner (MS 40, 1897).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1123}
