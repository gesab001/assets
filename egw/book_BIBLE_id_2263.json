{"word": "\"You should search the Bible; for it tells you of Jesus. As you read the Bible, you will see the matchless charms of Jesus. You will fall in love with the Man of Calvary, and at every step you can say to the world, 'His ways are ways of pleasantness, and all His paths are peace.' You are to represent Christ to the world. You may show to the world that you have a hope big with immortality. You may drink of the waters of salvation. Teach your children to love and fear God. You want the heavenly angels to be in your dwelling. You want the Sun of Righteousness shining in the darkened chambers of your mind, then your lips will speak thanksgiving to God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 293}
