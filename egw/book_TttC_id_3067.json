    "word": "\"God has given you your testimony, to set before the backslider and the sinner his true condition and the immense loss he is sustaining by continuing a life of sin. God has impressed this upon you by opening it before your vision as He has to no other one now living, and according to the light He has given you will He hold you responsible. 'Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.' Lift up your voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgressions, and the house of Israel their sins.\"",
