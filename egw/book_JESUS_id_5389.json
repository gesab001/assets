{"word": "Ministers of Christ, what have you to say for yourselves? What soul conflicts have you entered that have been for your good, for the good of souls, and for the glory of God? You who profess to be proclaiming the last solemn message to the world, what is your experience in the knowledge of the truth, and its effect upon your own hearts? Does your character testify for Christ? Can you speak of the refining, ennobling, sanctifying influence of the truth as it is in Jesus? What have you seen, and what have you known, of the power of Christ? This is the kind of witness for which the Lord calls, and for which the churches are suffering.\\97MS.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 103}
