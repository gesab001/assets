{"word": "Let not the testimony be borne concerning any of us, \"Religion has made them no better. They are as self-indulgent, as worldly, as sharp in trade, as ever.\" All who bear such fruit scatter from Christ, instead of gathering with Him. They place obstacles in the way of those whom they might by a consistent course have won to Jesus. It is our duty as Christians to give the world unmistakable evidence that we are obeying the great commandment, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,\" which is the same as our Saviour's golden rule, \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 241}
