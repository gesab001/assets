Do you allow your children to associate with other children without being present to know what kind of education they are receiving? Do not allow them to be alone with other children. Give them your special care. Every evening know where they are and what they are doing. Are they pure in all their habits? Have you instructed them in the principles of moral purity?

Then tell them that you mean now to do your God-appointed work. Ask them to take hold with you in the reform.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 114}
