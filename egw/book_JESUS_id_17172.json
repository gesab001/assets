{"word": "Satan will be highly pleased to have you cherish an unforgiving spirit instead of drawing together in even cords. But Jesus, who places a high value upon man, is grieved to see division among brethren. I wish we could all be as Jesus has given us an example in His life. He came not to destroy men's lives but to save them. He used His powers to bless but never to hurt. His words, His bearing, and His work were full of divine tenderness. Nothing could disturb His absolute patience or rouse Him to vindictiveness.--Letter 46, April 22, 1887, to Dr. J. H. Kellogg.", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 121}
