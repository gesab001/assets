{"word": "They remember how His love was slighted and His compassion abused. They think of how Barabbas, a murderer and a robber, was chosen in His stead, how Jesus was crowned with thorns and scourged and crucified, how in the hours of His agony on the cross the priests and rulers taunted Him, saying, \"Let Him come down from the cross, and we will believe Him. He saved others, Himself He cannot save.\" All the insult and despite offered to Christ, all the suffering caused to His disciples, will be as fresh in their recollection as when the satanic deeds were done.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 275}
