{"word": "(D) Moral Independence \n\n     The Law of Mutual Dependence.--We are all woven together in the great web of humanity, and whatever we can do to benefit and uplift others will reflect in blessing upon ourselves. The law of mutual dependence runs through all classes of society. The poor are not more dependent upon the rich than are the rich upon the poor. While the one class ask a share in the blessings which God has bestowed upon their wealthier neighbors, the other need the faithful service, the strength of brain and bone and muscle, that are the capital of the poor.--PP 534, 535 (1890).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 267}
