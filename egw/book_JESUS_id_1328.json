{"word": "Go to your neighbors one by one, and come close to them till their hearts are warmed by your unselfish interest and love. Sympathize with them, pray with them, watch for opportunities to do them good, and as you can, gather a few together and open the Word of God to their darkened minds. Keep watching, as he who must render an account for the souls of men, and make the most of the privileges that God gives you of laboring with Him in His moral vineyard. Do not neglect speaking to your neighbors, and doing them all the kindness in your power, that you \"by all means may save some.\" We need to seek for the spirit that constrained the apostle Paul to go from house to house pleading with tears, and teaching \"repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\"--Review and Herald, March 13, 1888.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 116}
