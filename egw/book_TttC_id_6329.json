    "word": "The prayer which Nathanael offered while he was under the fig tree came from a sincere heart, and it was heard and answered by the Master. Christ said of him: \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\" The Lord reads the hearts of all and understands their motives and purposes. \"The prayer of the upright is His delight.\" He will not be slow to hear those who open their hearts to Him, not exalting self, but sincerely feeling their great weakness and unworthiness.",
