{"word": "Results of Parent's Failure \n\n     How different would have been the Scriptural record of the history of Israel, a nation so highly favored of the Lord, if they had carried out the instruction given them from the pillar of cloud by the Son of the living God. But they did not diligently follow the admonitions given. They failed to teach their children the requirements of God; and the sad results are pictured before us in a nation rejected of God. They separated so far from the wisdom of God that when the Great Teacher, Jesus, the world's Redeemer, appeared, they cried, \"Away with Him!\" The tradition of men was more highly revered than the commandments of God. False practices and human inventions had taken the place of the pure teaching of God. That which was to have become a part of their being, was regarded as of small consequence and little worth.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 47}
