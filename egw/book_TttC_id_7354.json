    "word": "Chap. 25 - An Appeal\n[THIS APPEAL WAS WRITTEN AT \n      HEALDSBURG, CALIFORNIA, MAY 30, 1882, TO BE \n      READ AT THE CAMP MEETINGS. IT PRESENTS WARNINGS \n      AND INSTRUCTION WHICH THE WRITER, BEING ABSENT IN \n      PERSON, FELT URGED TO GIVE TO THE CHURCH. FOR THE \n      BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO WERE NOT PRESENT AT THOSE \n      MEETINGS, AND ALSO FOR ALL WHO MAY DESIRE TO \n      PRESERVE IT IN PERMANENT FORM, IT IS INSERTED \n      HERE.] \n\n     I am filled with sadness when I think of our condition as a people. The Lord has not closed heaven to us, but our own course of continual backsliding has separated us from God. Pride, covetousness, and love of the world have lived in the heart without fear of banishment or condemnation. Grievous and presumptuous sins have dwelt among us. And yet the general opinion is that the church is flourishing and that peace and spiritual prosperity are in all her borders.",
