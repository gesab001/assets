When it is perfectly pliable, he continues the work of making of it a vessel. He forms it into shape and on the wheel trims and polishes it. He dries it in the sun and bakes it in the oven.

We are not to try to do the work of the potter. Our part is to yield ourselves to the molding of the Master Worker.",
