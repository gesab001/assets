{"word": "The only remedy . . . is thorough discipline and organization. A spirit of fanaticism has ruled a certain class of Sabbathkeepers . . . ; they have sipped but lightly at the fountain of truth and are unacquainted with the spirit of the message of the third angel. Nothing can be done for this class until their fanatical views are corrected. Some who were in the 1854 movement have brought along with them erroneous views, such as the non-resurrection of the wicked, and the future age, and they are seeking to unite these views and their past experience with the message of the third angel. They cannot do this; there is no concord between Christ and Belial.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 198}
