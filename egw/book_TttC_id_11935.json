    "word": "Nature Testifies Of God \n\n     The things of nature upon which we look today give us but a faint conception of Eden's beauty and glory. Yet much that is beautiful remains. Nature testifies that One infinite in power, great in goodness, mercy, and love, created the earth and filled it with life and gladness. Even in their blighted state all things reveal the handiwork of the great Master Artist. Though sin has marred the form and beauty of the things of nature, though on them may be seen traces of the work of the prince of the power of the air, yet they still speak of God. In the briers, the thistles, the thorns, the tares, \n                                                                           257\nwe may read the law of condemnation; but from the beauty of natural things, and from their wonderful adaptation to our needs and our happiness, we may learn that God still loves us, that His mercy is yet manifested to the world. \n\n\n         \"The heavens declare the glory of God; \n          And the firmament showeth His handiwork. \n          Day unto day uttereth speech, \n          And night unto night showeth knowledge. \n          There is no speech nor language, \n          Where their voice is not heard.\" \n                                          Psalm 19:1-3.",
