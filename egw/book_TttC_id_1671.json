    "word": "You lack benevolence. You labor to save yourself from care, trouble, or expense for the cause of God. You have invested but little in the cause. The enterprise which man values the most will be seen by his investments. If he places a higher estimate upon eternal things than upon temporal things, he will show this by his works; he will invest the most, and venture the most, in that which he values the highest and which in the end brings him the greatest profit.",
