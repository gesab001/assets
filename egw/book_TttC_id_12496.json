    "word": "In Portland, Maine; in Boston and the towns round about; in New York and the populous cities close by; in Philadelphia and Baltimore and Washington, the Lord desires us to proclaim the third angel's message with power. We cannot exercise this power ourselves, but we can choose men of capability and urge them to go into these avenues of opportunity and there proclaim the message in the power of the Holy Spirit. We must plan to place in these cities capable men who can present the third angel's message in a manner so forcible that it will strike home to the heart. Men who can do this work \n                                                                           100\nwe cannot afford to gather into one place to do a work that others might do.",
