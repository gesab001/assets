{"word": "70 (Matthew 10:32; 26:63, 64; Mark 14:61, 62). A Time to Speak.-- When Jesus was asked the question, Art thou the Son of God? He knew that to answer in the affirmative would make His death certain; a denial would leave a stain upon His humanity. There was a time to be silent, and a time to speak. He had not spoken until plainly interrogated. In His lessons to His disciples He had declared: \"Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.\" When challenged, Jesus did not deny His relationship with God. In that solemn moment His character was at stake and must be vindicated. He left on that occasion an example for man to follow under similar circumstances. He would teach him not to apostatize from his faith to escape suffering or even death (3SP 127).", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1124}
