    "word": "These lessons must be forced upon young believers continually, not only by precept, but by example, that in their Christian experience they may realize similar results.

In such efforts, mingled with prayer for divine light, their own hearts will throb with the quickening influence of the grace of God; their own affections will glow with more divine fervor, and their whole Christian life will be more of a reality, more earnest, more prayerful.",
