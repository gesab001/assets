    "word": "I was shown that Brother and Sister E are in danger of having their thoughts centered too much upon themselves; especially is Sister E at fault here. She has almost supreme love for herself. You, my sister, are poorly prepared to stand amid the perils of the day of God. You do not imitate the true Pattern, Jesus. There was not one selfish act in His whole life. You have a work to do for yourself which no one can do for you. Divest yourself of selfishness, and learn the mind and will of God. Study to show yourself approved unto God. You are impulsive, and are naturally irritable and peevish. You work far beyond your strength. There is no virtue in this, for God does not require it. A selfish disposition is at the bottom of this. Your motives are not praiseworthy. You shun responsibility and caretaking, and have felt that you should be favored. It is to be regretted that from your childhood you have been petted and favored, and your will left unsubdued. Now, at a more advanced age, you have the work to do which should have been done in your childhood. Your husband has yielded to your wishes and indulged your whims, to your injury.",
