    "word": "We shall have a debt to settle with the Master by and by, when He shall say: \"Give an account of thy stewardship.\" If men prefer to set aside the claims of God and to grasp and selfishly retain all that He gives them, He will hold His peace at present and continue frequently to test them by increasing His bounties by letting His blessings flow on, and these men may pass on receiving honor of men and without censure in the church; but by and by He will say: \"Give an account of thy stewardship.\" Says Christ: \"Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me.\" \"Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price,\" and are under obligation to glorify God with your means as well as in your body and in your spirit, which are His. \"Ye are bought with a price,\" not \"with corruptible things, as silver and gold,\" \"but with the precious blood of Christ.\" He asks a return of the gifts that He has entrusted to us, to aid in the salvation of souls. He has given His blood; He asks our silver. It is through His poverty that we are made rich; and will we refuse to give back to Him His own gifts?",
