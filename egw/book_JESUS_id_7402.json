{"word": "Jesus pleaded, not for one only, but for all His disciples: \"Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am\" (John 17:24). His eye pierced the dark veil of the future and read the life history of every son and daughter of Adam. He felt the burdens and sorrows of every tempest-tossed soul, and that earnest prayer included with His living disciples all His followers to the close of time. . . . That prayer . . . embraces even us. . . .
