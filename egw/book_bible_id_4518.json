{"word": "God calls for all to come into harmony with Himself. He will receive them if they will put away their evil actions. By a union with the divine nature of Christ, they may escape the corrupting influences of this world. It is time for every one of us to decide whose side we are on. The agencies of Satan will work with every mind that will allow itself to be worked by him. But there are also heavenly agencies waiting to communicate the bright rays of the glory of God to all that are willing to receive Him. It is truth that we want, precious truth in all its loveliness. Truth will bring liberty and gladness.\\97The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Ellen G. White Comments, vol. 4, pp. 1153, 1154.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 378}
