{"word": "29 (2 Corinthians 3:18; Colossians 3:10). Moral Image of God Restored Through Christ.--Though the moral image of God was almost obliterated by the sin of Adam, through the merits and power of Jesus it may be renewed. Man may stand with the moral image of God in his character; for Jesus will give it to him. Unless the moral image of God is seen in man, he can never enter the city of God as a conqueror (RH June 10, 1890).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1078}
