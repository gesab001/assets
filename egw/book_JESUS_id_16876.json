{"word": "How can we remain in doubt, questioning whether Jesus loves us, sinful though we be and compassed with infirmities? He gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. He came to our world in the humble guise of a man, that He might become acquainted with the griefs and temptations that beset man's pathway, and that He might know how to help the weary with His offer of rest and peace. But thousands upon thousands refuse His assistance and only cling more firmly to their burden of care. He comes to the afflicted, and offers to soothe their grief and heal their sorrow. . . . To the disappointed, the unbelieving, and the unhappy He offers contentment, while pointing to mansions that He is preparing for them. . . . Jesus, our precious Saviour, should be first in our thoughts and affections, and we should trust Him with entire confidence. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 225}
