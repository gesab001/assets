{"word": "Chap. 4 - The Teacher and His Work\n\n      The Highest of All Sciences \n\n     It means so much more than finite minds can comprehend, to present in every missionary effort Jesus Christ and Him crucified. \"But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.\" \"For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.\" This is to be the burden of our work. If any one thinks he is capable of teaching in the Sabbath school or in the day school the science of education, he needs first to learn the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, that he may teach this the highest of all sciences.--FE 272.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 89}
