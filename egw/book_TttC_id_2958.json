    "word": "You have younger sisters whom you can bless with your influence. You can reflect a sweet, precious light in your father's family and make his heart glad; or you can be a dark shadow, a cloud, a storm which shall desolate. Your passion for reading is of such a character that if indulged it will pervert the imagination and will prove your ruin. Unless you restrain your thoughts, your reading, and your words, your imagination will become hopelessly diseased. Read your Bible attentively, prayerfully, and be guided by its teachings. This is your safety. \n                                                                           564",
