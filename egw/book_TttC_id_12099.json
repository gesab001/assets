    "word": "Historical and Theological Lore \n\n     Many who are seeking a preparation for the Lord's work think it essential to accumulate large volumes of historical and theological writings. They suppose that the study of these works will be a great advantage to them in learning how to reach the people. This is an error. As I see shelves piled with these books, some of them rarely looked into, I think: Why spend money for that which is not bread? The sixth chapter of John tells us more than can be found in such works. Christ says: \"I am the Bread of Life.\" \"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" John 6:35, 63.",
