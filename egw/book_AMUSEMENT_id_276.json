{"word": "Solomon says, \"He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool\" (Proverbs 28:26); and there are hundreds of such to be found among professors of godliness. Says the apostle: \"We are not ignorant of his [Satan's] devices.\" Oh, what art, what skill, what cunning, is exercised to lead the professed followers of Christ to a union with the world by seeking for happiness in the amusements of the world, under the delusion that some good is to be gained! And thus the unguarded walk right into the net, flattering themselves that there is no evil in the way. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 313}
