    "word": "\"Thou wast perfect in thy ways . . . till iniquity was found in thee.\" \"Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.\" All this was the gift of God. God was not chargeable with this--making the covering cherub beautiful, noble and good. \"By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: . . . thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick.\" In this place \"traffick\" is the emblem of corrupt administration. It denotes the bringing of self-seeking into spiritual offices. Nothing in spiritual service is acceptable to God except the purposes and works that are for the good of the universe. To do good to others will redound to the glory of God.",
