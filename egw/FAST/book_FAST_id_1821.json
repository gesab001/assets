    "word": "Let the many ministers of Christ sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, and seek God while He is to be found. Call upon Him while you are now lying at the foot of the cross of Calvary. Divest yourselves of all pride and as representative guardians of the churches, weep between the porch and the altar, and cry \"Spare Thy people, Lord, and give not Thine heritage to reproach. Take from us what Thou wilt, but withhold not Thy Holy Spirit from us, Thy people.\" Pray, oh, pray for the outpouring of the Spirit of God!--Manuscript 27, 1889.",
