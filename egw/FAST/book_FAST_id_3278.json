    "word": "Daniel was a man to whom God had given great skill and learning, and when he fasted the angel came to him and said, \"Thou are greatly beloved.\" And he fell prostrate before the angel. He did not say, Lord, I have been very faithful to You and I have done everything to honor You and defend Your word and name. Lord, You know how faithful I was at the king's table, and how I maintained my integrity when they cast me into the den of lions. Was that the way Daniel prayed to God? No. He prayed and confessed his sins, and said, Hear O Lord, and deliver; we have departed from Thy Word and have sinned. And when he saw the angel, he said, My comeliness was turned into corruption. He could not look upon the angel's face, and he had no strength; it was all gone. So the angel came to him and set him upon his knees. He could not behold him then. And then the angel came to him with the appearance of a man. Then he could bear the sight. \n\n\n                                      -349-",
