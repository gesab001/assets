    "word": "I know that God cannot approve of your connecting Brother Hanson with a committee or giving him any trust while he has cut himself loose from the church and stands dishonoring God in his business matters. It shows that the man has not true and sacred ideas of holy things, and you are fastening him in a fatal deception in thus treating his case. My brother, you have done more to keep him in this position of blindness than any other man could do. You have in your attitude said to the sinner, \"It shall be well with you.\" You say you could not labor with him or turn him out because he is not in the church, yet you have linked up with him and showed your preference for him and made him your confidant and counsellor. He has upheld you and you have upheld him, and God is dishonored by you both.",
