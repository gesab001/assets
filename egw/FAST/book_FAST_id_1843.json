    "word": "Abraham's Family Touched by False Worship.--In that age, idolatry was fast creeping in and conflicting with the worship of the true God. But Abraham did not become an idolater. Although his own father was vacillating between the true and the false worship, and with his knowledge of the truth false theories and idolatrous practises were mingled, Abraham kept free from this infatuation. He was not ashamed of his faith, and made no effort to hide the fact that he made God his trust. He \"builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord\" (YI March 4, 1897).",
