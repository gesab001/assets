    "word": "Intervals Between Discourses. \n\n     Do not immediately follow one discourse with another,  but let a period of rest intervene, that the truth may be fastened in the mind, and that opportunity for meditation and prayer may be given for both ministers and people. Thus there will be growth in religious knowledge and experience.",
