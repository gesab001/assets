Men in responsible positions, craving large buildings \"to make an \n\n\n                                  -200- \n\nappearance and give character to the work,\" have neglected the only means that can give character to the work. The only way they can do this is to abide in the Vine, and show by their good works that they are vitally connected with it. Thus they can represent Christ in the fruit they bear, and diffuse light to the world. \"Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?\" [Isaiah 58:6]. \"And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not\" [verse 11]. Christ says of His work: [Isaiah 61:1-3, quoted].",
