    "word": "The first sight of an English train gives anything but a favorable impression. The cars are lower, narrower, and shorter than the American cars; and they look even shorter than they really are, because they have no projecting platforms at the ends, and no overhanging roofs. The platform is not needed, because the car is entered from the side. As you approach the train, a gentlemanly official opens the door of a first, second, or third class compartment, according to your ticket, and if you object to one in which smoking is permitted, he finds one in which it is prohibited. Entering through the narrow door, you find yourself in a little room about seven feet by nine, with two seats and two doors, a seat on each side and a door at each end. The end of the compartment is the side of the car. On each side of the doors are stationary windows, and in the upper part of the door is a window which can \n168\nbe lowered or raised according to the amount of ventilation desired. Just before the train leaves the station, the doors are all closed and locked, and are at once unlocked on reaching another station. The conductor walks along a foot-rail on the outside of the car, clinging to rods placed there for this purpose, and receives the tickets through the window. On fast trains the tickets are usually examined at the stations.",
