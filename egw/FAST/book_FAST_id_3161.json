    "word": "I was shown that a terrible condition of things is seen to exist in our world. The angel of mercy is folding her wings, ready to depart. Already the Lord's restraining power is being withdrawn from the earth, and the power of Satan is working in the world to stir up the religious elements, under the training of the great deceiver, to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in the children of disobedience. Already the inhabitants of the earth are marshalling under the leadings of the prince of darkness, and this is only the beginning of the end. The law of God is made void. We see and hear of confusion, perplexities, want and famine, earthquakes and floods; terrible outrages will be committed by men; passion not reason bears sway. The wrath of God is upon the inhabitants of a world that is fast becoming as corrupt as were the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. Already fires and floods are destroying thousands of human beings and the property that has been selfishly boarded by the oppression of the poor. The Lord is soon to cut short his work, and put \n\n\n                         -7- \n\nan end to sin. O that the scenes which have come before me, of the iniquities practiced in these last days, might make a suitable impression on the minds of God's professed people.",
