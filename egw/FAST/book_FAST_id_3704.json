    "word": "I expect to meet in the judgment the words spoken to Sister Gates. Whatever report she has made which inspired Dr. Burke to speak with pen, words to me as no man or woman has ever addressed to me by pen or voice, reveals the spirit that has been fast becoming a controlling power in the Health Retreat. Now, all the words I uttered I did because I could not endure the wrong practices which were perverting souls, as is evidenced in the spirit and the manner of working that Sister Gates has been engaged in. The rebuke of God is upon her and upon those who have inspired her to engage in a work that God has never set her to do--to judge and accuse and condemn, while the one in error was left unwarned, uncorrected. This is the manner of Satan's working, but the rebuke of God is upon all who participate in this kind of work from the greatest to the least.",
