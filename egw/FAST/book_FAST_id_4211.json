    "word": "Every soul in this world is bought with a price. To every man is given his work. \"Ministers,\" this term includes all who do their appointed work, giving God honest service. No one is to apologize for recognizing his personal accountability to God by standing in his lot and in his place. God calls for every man's best energies. No man can find in any human being the strength that will enable him to serve God with all his powers. He must be a partaker of the divine nature. There is now a great work to be done in a short time, and it is essential for the men and women in God's service to look unto Jesus every moment. Brethren and sisters, break every yoke that man would fasten upon you. Take upon you the yoke of Christ. Learn of him who is meek and lowly in heart.",
