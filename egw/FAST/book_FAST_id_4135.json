    "word": "I have been instructed that it is not extravagant display which is now required in giving the last message of mercy to our world. We must go forth in the simplicity of true godliness. Our sanitariums, our schools, our publishing houses, are to be God's instrumentalities to represent the humble manner of Christ's teaching. In a marked manner the Lord will be the strength and power of His people. Maintain simplicity; and pray in faith constantly. Wherever you are, your only safety is in prayer. Hold fast the beginning of your confidence firm unto the end.",
