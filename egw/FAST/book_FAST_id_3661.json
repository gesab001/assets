    "word": "Christ has gone to prepare mansions for those who are faithful. To the immortal inheritance those who love God and keep His commandments have a clear title--a title that will never be questioned. Those who by faith take God at His word have an everlasting life-insurance policy. Those who now by faith enter the kingdom of God and hold fast their profession of faith, will possess the kingdom forever and ever.",
