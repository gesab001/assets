    "word": "Sister Harris and Clarissa were set entirely free and they prayed God with a loud voice. The spirit caused Clarissa to laugh aloud. James was healed every whit; the great distress he had had in his head was every whit removed and he looked as though he had got the holy anointing. The fever and all pain left him and he ate and was strengthened. He walked out upon his faith, harnessed his horse and he and I went to Port Byron, one mile and a half and back. He gained strength very fast. He is quite strong today. Praise the good Lord. \n\n\n                                   -209-",
