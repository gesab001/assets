    "word": "The first Adam fell: the second Adam held fast to God and His word under the most trying circumstances, and His faith in His Father's goodness, mercy, and love did not waver for one moment. \"It is written\" was His weapon of resistance, and it is the sword of the Spirit which every human being is to use. \"Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me\"--nothing to respond to temptation. Not one occasion has been given in response to His manifold temptations. \n\n\n                                  -20- \n\nNot once did Christ step on Satan's ground, to give him any advantage. Satan found nothing in Him to encourage his advances.",
