    "word": "C. T. & B. H.--19 \n     Christ fought the battle upon the point of appetite, and came off victorious; and we also can conquer through strength derived from Him. Who will enter in through the gates into the city?--Not those who declare that they can not break the force of appetite. Christ has resisted the power of him who would hold us in bondage; though weakened by His long fast of forty days, He withstood temptation, and proved by this act that our cases are not hopeless. I know that we can not obtain the victory alone; and how thankful we should be that we have a living Saviour, who is ready and willing to aid us!",
