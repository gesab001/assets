    "word": "These popular authors have not pointed out to the students the way that leads to eternal life. \"For this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent.\" John 17:3. The authors of these books current in our schools are recommended and exalted as learned men; their education is in every way deficient, unless they themselves have been educated in the school of Christ, and by practical knowledge bear witness to the Word of God as the most essential study for children and youth. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" Books should have been prepared to place in the hands of students that would educate them to have a sincere reverent love for truth and steadfast integrity. The class of studies which are positively essential in the formation of character to give them a preparation for the future life, should be kept ever before them. Christ should be uplifted as the first great Teacher, the only begotten Son of God, who was with the Father from eternal ages. . .",
