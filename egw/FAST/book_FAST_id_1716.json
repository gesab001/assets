    "word": "In his old age John revealed the life of Christ in his life.  He lived to be nearly one hundred years old, and over and over again he repeated the story of the crucified and risen Saviour.  Persecution came upon the believers, and those young in experience were often in danger of losing their hold on Christ.  But the old, tried servant of Jesus steadfastly maintained his faith.  -- 7 BC 947.",
