    "word": "Remember the words of the inspired apostle, \"Ye are not your own. For ye are bought with a price\" (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20). You are bought, . . . even if you perish. The Lord wants His own property. When we have given to God soul, body, and spirit; when we have kept appetite under the control of enlightened conscience, and wrestled against every lust, showing that we consider each organ as God's property, intended for His service; when all our affections move in harmony with the Lord's mind, fastening on objects \"which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God\" (Colossians 3:1)--then we have given the Lord His own. O God, \"all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee\" (1 Chronicles 29:14). . . .",
