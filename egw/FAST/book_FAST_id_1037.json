    "word": "On Sunday afternoon I spoke of the time of trial and persecution awaiting God's people, and their duty to hold fast the truth. God has presented in his word sacred truths, and he expects us to accept them without regard to our own convenience, or good name, or worldly profit. Whenever a doctrine or duty is brought before us, the all-important question to be decided is, Is it enforced by the word of God? Does the Lord require this of us? If so, whatever may be the cross involved, we should unhesitatingly accept it.",
