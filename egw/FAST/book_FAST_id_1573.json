    "word": "MOSES \n\nFOLLOW MOSES\u2019 EXAMPLE IN PRAYER.\u2014Talk less; much precious time is lost in talk that brings no light. Let brethren unite in fasting and prayer for the wisdom that God has promised to supply liberally. Make known your troubles to God. Tell Him, as did Moses, \u201cI cannot lead this people unless Thy presence shall go with me.\u201d And then ask still more; pray with Moses, \u201cShow me Thy glory.\u201d [Exodus 33:18.] What is this glory?\u2014The character of God. This is what He proclaimed to Moses.\u2014(Gospel Workers, 417.)",
