    "word": "We are to \"stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.\" No man or woman is to bind himself or herself to serve for a certain number of years under the control of a medical association. This is not God's plan, but a plan of human devising. Human beings belong to the Lord, body, soul, and spirit, and they are to be guided and controlled by him. He has bought us. We are under obligation to be laborers together with him. No one should bind himself to serve for a certain number of years in any institution.",
