To the Brethren in Southern California: \n\nDear Brethren: \n\n\n     I am instructed to say to you, Let every soul earnestly seek the Lord. We all need to understand clearly what is our duty, that we may make no false moves. We need to hold fast the experiences which in the past the Lord has given us. I have a great desire to see success attend every movement we shall make.",
