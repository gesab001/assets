    "word": "A child was sent to the field to tell Brother Abbey that four Sabbath keepers had come. He was in no hurry, however, to make our acquaintance; for he had previously been imposed upon by some who had often visited them. These, professing to be God's servants, had scattered error among the little flock who were trying to hold fast the truth. Brother and Sister Abbey had warred against them for so long that they dreaded to come into contact with them. Brother Abbey feared that we were of the same class. When he came into the house, he received us coldly, and then began asking a few plain, direct questions, as to whether we kept the Sabbath and believed the past messages to be of God. When he was satisfied that we had come with truth, he joyfully welcomed us.",
