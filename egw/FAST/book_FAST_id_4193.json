    "word": "We can not have a weak faith now; we can not be safe in a listless, indolent, slothful attitude. Every joy or ability is to be used, and sharp, calm, deep thinking is to be done. The wisdom of any human agent is not sufficient for the planning and devising in this time. Spread every plan before God with fasting, with humbling of the soul before the Lord Jesus, and commit thy ways unto the Lord; the sure promise is, He will direct thy path. He is infinite in resources. The Holy One of Israel, who calls the host of heaven by name, and holds the stars of Heaven in position, has you individually in His keeping. \n\n\n                                   -85-",
