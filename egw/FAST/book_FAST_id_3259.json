    "word": "May 30 [Monday]. We left Vohwinkel at 7:00 a.m. for Gladbach. We had an appointment to speak Monday night. We arrived at Gladbach about 10:00 a.m. We found friends waiting at the depot for us. We took a hack for Sister Doerner's, who owns the building where they live. Her daughter is living with her. We were shown to a very pleasant room which we were to occupy during our stay. Breakfast was ready, but I could barely taste of the breakfast because I was constantly so sick to my stomach. The breakfast was comprised mostly of cake and bread and coffee.",
