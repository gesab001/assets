    "word": "FAMILIES SHOULD HAVE FIXED TIMES FOR MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER.\u2014In every family there should be a fixed time for morning and evening worship. How appropriate it is for parents to gather their children about them before the fast is broken, to thank the heavenly Father for His protection during the night, and to ask Him for His help and guidance and watch care during the day! How fitting, also, when evening comes, for parents and children to gather once more before Him and thank Him for the blessings of the day that is past!\u2014(Child Guidance, 520.)",
