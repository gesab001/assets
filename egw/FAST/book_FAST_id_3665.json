    "word": "Christ came to adjust truths that had been misplaced and made to serve the cause of error. He recalled them, repeated them, placed them in their proper position in the framework of truth, and bade them stand fast forever. Thus it was with the law of God, with the Sabbath, and with the marriage institution. \n\n\n                                   -22- \n\nWe are to study His example. Satan seeks to obliterate everything that would keep the true God in remembrance; but the followers of Christ are to treasure up what God has revealed. No truth of His Word, opened to them by His Spirit, is to be set aside.",
