    "word": "Elder Olsen, I hope you will not permit anxiety concerning the neglect of duties of the church to so cloud your mind that you will fail to look steadfastly to Jesus. \"Behold the lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.\" It is proper to entreat the church to make individual work in repenting because they have left their first love; but never despair. Jesus loves all these souls better than you can love them. You have your work to do. It is a responsible work, but you are not to look at it until it assumes so large proportions, that it hides Jesus from your sight. You are pained because many are satisfied with the form of godliness, while denying the power thereof. They look with satisfaction in the performance of outward ceremonies, and yet there is no evidence that they are virtually connected with God. They are deceived in regard to their condition, and this deception \n\n\n                                    -10- \n\nis hard to break up. They know little of the depths of their own natural corruption, or of the infinite holiness of God. They do not realize that the foundation of all their faith and hope should only be the perfection of Jesus our surety. The only genuine saving faith is that which lays hold upon the imputed righteousness of Christ. He is the only source of virtue, of spiritual power and life. Each must have a knowledge of God for himself, must have faith in Jesus Christ whom God hath sent. When the members of the church have this experience Christian virtues will shine forth, and they will be clothed with humility. The fruit of this faith will be love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness and goodness, and the object of their lives will be to glorify God day by day.",
