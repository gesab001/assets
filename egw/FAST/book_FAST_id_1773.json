    "word": "\"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip [margin: \"run out as leaking vessels\"]. For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?\" (Hebrews 2:1-3). \"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end\" (Hebrews 3:12-14).",
