    "word": "Let your faith be pure and strong and steadfast. Bring all the pleasantness you can into the school, Let gratitude to God fill your hearts. Remember the words, \"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth God\" [see Psalms 50:23]. When you rise in the morning, kneel at your bedside and ask God to give you strength to fulfill the duties of the day and to meet its temptations. Ask Him to help you to bring into your work Christ's sweetness of character. Ask Him to help you to speak words that will draw those around you nearer to Christ.",
