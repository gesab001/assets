    "word": "In the Scriptures we read, \"Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" Every branch of God's work is worthy of diligence, but nothing could be more deserving than this work at this time. None should labor with the expectation of receiving his reward in this life, but with his eyes fixed steadfastly upon the prize at the end of the race. Men and women are wanted now who are as true to duty as the needle to the pole,--men and women who will work without having their way smoothed, and every obstacle removed. If we seek the Lord and become converted; if of our own choice we become free and joyous in God; if with gladsome consent of the heart we respond to his gracious call, wearing the yoke of Christ, which is one of obedience and service, our difficulties will be removed, our murmurings will be stilled, and many of the questions that may arise will be answered.",
