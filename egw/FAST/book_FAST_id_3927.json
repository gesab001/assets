    "word": "The other night, in a scene which passed before me, I saw one slipping down a precipice. A company was looking on indifferently, making no effort to save him. But one hand--the hand of Christ-- was stretched out, and the man was rescued. Christ drew him up, saying. \"Hold fast to Me.\" He then placed the hands of the rescued man in the hands of his brethren who stood near, saying, \"I have drawn him up that he may stand on vantage ground. Work for the salvation of souls, that you may all stand on vantage ground before God.\"",
