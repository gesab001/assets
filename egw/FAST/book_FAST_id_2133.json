    "word": "By the people of God a voice, clear and melodious, is heard, saying, \"Look up,\" and, lifting their eyes to the heavens, they behold the bow of promise. \n                                                                           453\nThe black, angry clouds that covered the firmament are parted, and like Stephen they look up steadfastly into Heaven, and see the glory of God, and the Son of man seated upon his throne. In his divine form they discern the marks of his humiliation; and from his lips they hear the request, presented before his Father and the holy angels, \"I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am,\" Again a voice, musical and triumphant, is heard, saying, \"They come! they come! holy, harmless, and undefiled. They have kept the word of my patience; they shall walk among the angels;\" and the pale, quivering lips of those who have held fast their faith, utter a shout of victory.",
