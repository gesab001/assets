    "word": "Significance of the Test\n \n\n     When Christ bore the test of temptation upon the point of appetite He did not stand in beautiful Eden, as did Adam, with the light and love of God seen in everything His eye rested upon; but He was in a barren, desolate wilderness, surrounded with wild beasts. Everything around Him was repulsive. With these surroundings, He fasted forty days and forty nights, \"and in those days he did eat nothing.\" He was emaciated through long fasting and felt the keenest sense of hunger. His visage was indeed marred more than the sons of men.",
