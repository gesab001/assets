    "word": "In the Place of a Father \n\n     All our institutions should be missionary agencies in every sense of the word. No work is to be allowed to hinder the work of soul saving. In every institution there is missionary work to be done. From the manager down to the humblest worker, all should feel a responsibility for the unconverted among their own number. They should put forth earnest efforts to win them to Christ. As a result of such effort many will be won to the Saviour and will become faithful and true in service to God. The consistent, religious life, the holy conversation, the unswerving integrity, the godly example--these are the means God uses to fasten conviction on the hearts and consciences of unbelievers.",
