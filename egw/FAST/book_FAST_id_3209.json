    "word": "My husband has divorced himself from the interest of his family to supply the want of labor in others. He has had no social enjoyment with his family. After his increased labor during the Conference of 1872, his strength seemed to give way. He could do no more. He could not sleep or rest nights. Nearly every night I was obliged to be up with him from two to four hours, giving him treatment to relieve his sufferings. We then felt clear to drop the burdens that we had borne, and flee for our lives from Battle Creek. We are in Colorado mountains, and my husband is now fast improving in health. His physical and mental vigor are returning. The first of next week we leave the retired mountains of Colorado for California.",
