    "word": "But with the world there is a sacrifice made that is amazing to the heavenly intelligences. Satan is master of their appetites and inclinations, and he leads them to gratify and indulge perverted, unnatural appetites. He leads them to suppose that this is the very sum and substance of their happiness. A created appetite is the only law that controls the tobacco devotee, and it will continue to be thus to the close of this earth's history. Men and women and children are corrupting their ways before the Lord. They are fast reaching the boundary line when the Lord will speak, and His words, going forth from His exalted throne, will not return unto Him void.",
