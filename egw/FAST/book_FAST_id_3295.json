    "word": "(Colorado,) Monday, Aug., 19, 1872. It is a beautiful morning. We took breakfast with our nephew and niece, Mr. and Mrs. Fair. Had a short season of prayer and then walked about one mile and a quarter to Sister Bental's. She welcomed us heartily. We have been writing, preparing copy for [The Health] Reformer. Wrote Edson about eight pages. Sister Stocker brought me specimens. In returning home the horses balked, and we were obliged to walk miles.",
