    "word": "You have pushed aside this known and tried laborer, and have readily accepted a stranger. You have hunted down the man to whom you were so greatly indebted, and have given your confidence to one whose plans and principles are new and untried. Then there appears in the Review a notice of the celebration of Longfellow's birthday. You deify a man of whose heart you know nothing, of whose relation to God you know nothing. This is similar to the course pursued by Aaron, when he made the golden calf in the absence of Moses, and offered sacrifice before it, while the people proclaimed, \"These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\" Have the church at Battle Creek put out their eyes, that they cannot see the tendency of these things? If I did not know how God regards your course, I would not write thus. The time spent in paying honor to a mere man, might better have been employed in fasting and praying before God.",
