    "word": "God has a great work to be done in a short time. He has committed to the young, talents of intellect, time, and means, and He holds them responsible for the use they make of these good gifts. He calls upon them to come to the front, to resist the corrupting, bewitching influences of this fast age and to become qualified to labor in His cause. They cannot become fitted for usefulness without putting heart and energy into the work of preparation. . . .",
