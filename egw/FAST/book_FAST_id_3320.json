    "word": "November 27 we were among strangers in a place we had never visited before. We had both E. G. W. and Miss Sara McEnterfer become so thoroughly chilled that it was very difficult to get the blood to the surface for good circulation. We walked out, Sara and I, about one mile, and the air was sharp and bracing. I came to the breakfast table at nine o'clock. Oh, how hungry I was! I ate very heartily. Dinner was at three o'clock and I was again \n\n\n                                    -43- \n\nhungry for dinner. It was Thanksgiving Day. . . . Brother Miles talked that night to the few assembled. The people are very much scattered and cannot readily assemble at the meetinghouse.-- Ms 49, 1890, pp. 1, 2. (Diary, Nov. 26-Dec. 3, 1890. \"In Norwich, Connecticut.\")",
