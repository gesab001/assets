    "word": "Dying Charity Versus Living Benevolence \n\n     I saw that many withhold from the cause while they live, quieting their consciences that they will be charitable at death; they hardly dare exercise faith and trust in God to give anything while living.  But this deathbed charity is not what Christ requires of His followers; it cannot excuse the selfishness of the living.  Those who hold fast their property till the last moment, surrender it to death rather than to the cause.  Losses are occurring continually.  Banks fail, and property is consumed in very many ways.  Many purpose to do something, but they delay the matter, and Satan works to prevent the means from coming into the treasury at all.  It is lost before it is returned to God, and Satan exults that it is so.",
