    "word": "Support for Review and Signs Urged.--Do not neglect as you have done to recommend and urge the people everywhere to take the Review as well as the Signs of the Times. I think the Review publishing house has not been treated by you as it should have been. You had your mind fastened on one thing, the extension of the Signs, and you have let this absorb everything else. This is seen and felt by our people at large. You should come out in the Signs frequently and urge your brethren to take the Review, our church paper. But do not let there be a divorcing of your interests from the Review.--Lt 1, 1881.",
