May the Lord help you as His servant to appeal to the ministers and to arouse the sleeping churches. Let your labors as a physician and a minister be in harmony. It is for this that our sanitariums are established, to preach the truth of true temperance. . . .  {TSDF 170.10}  \n     Christ entered upon the test upon the point of appetite, and for nearly six weeks resisted temptation in behalf of man.
