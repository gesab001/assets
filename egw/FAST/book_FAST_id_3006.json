    "word": "This is a testimony similar to that I have borne in many places where carelessness in words and spirit have been manifest, revealing a low spiritual standard. God wants to work through ministers, through physicians, and through all connected with sanitarium work; and there will be a great work done here when all cheapness and frivolity are put away. In a marvelous way God has worked to give us this and other similar institutions; but it is represented to me that these institutions are not reaching the high standard that God requires them to reach. The workers can not attain this of themselves, but God can give them the right mold of character if they feel the necessity of looking to Him and holding fast to His promises.",
