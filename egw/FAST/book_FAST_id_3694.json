    "word": "The leaders are responsible not only for their own unsanctified mistakes, but for the mistakes of those who follow their example. When reproved for bringing in wrong principles they manifest a perverse spirit, a spirit that will not be corrected or humbled. \"Shall I not judge for these things, saith the Lord of hosts?\" Their own wisdom and their own judgment they hold fast as a precious possession, and sullenly pursue their own ways. This is the reason that the Holy Spirit of God is not manifest in our churches.",
