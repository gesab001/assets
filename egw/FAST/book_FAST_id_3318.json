    "word": "The colored race have been passed by with some deplorable expressions of regret, but with eyes fastened on the more promising fields nigh their own strong borders. Suppose God's people shall lift up their eyes and look on destitute fields that have not been worked. The missionary spirit must prevail if we individually shall form characters after the pattern, Christ Jesus. The colored people have souls to save. They are our neighbors in the sight of God, and we can not merely look and deplore the discouraging appearance of the field, and pass by on the other side. We must unitedly take hold, and interestedly seek to work the field. We are not only to look, but we are to go in and reap. It is those in the most need that God calls us to consider and help. As workers together with God we are to engage in labor. We are not only to pity the Southern people, but we are to help them as they shall need help. . . . There is no time to be lost. . . .",
