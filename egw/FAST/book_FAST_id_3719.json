    "word": "Medical Missionary Training Schools \n     W. C. WHITE: IN BATTLE CREEK, ONE REASON WHY THE SANITARIUM DID NOT PAY ITS DEBTS FASTER WAS BECAUSE THEY FELT THE BURDEN OF EDUCATING WORKERS FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. IF THE BURDEN OF EDUCATING WORKERS ON THE PACIFIC COAST IS EVER TAKEN UP AND BORNE BY THE PEOPLE ON THE COAST, IT WOULD SEEM TO REST HERE. WE HAVE ALWAYS DEPENDED LARGELY UPON DRAWING EXPERIENCED WORKERS FROM BATTLE CREEK, BUT IT SEEMS AS IF THE TIME HAS COME WHEN WE OUGHT TO MAKE AN EARNEST EFFORT TO EDUCATE WORKERS HERE.",
