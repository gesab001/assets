    "word": "Thursday morning we arose from our berths refreshed with sleep. At eight o'clock we took a portion of the food liberally furnished us by our friends and the sanitarium, and enjoyed our breakfast. I limited myself to but one meal per day during the entire journey. When the train stopped for any length of time at stations, we improved the opportunity by taking a brisk walk. Generally in approaching Cheyenne and Sherman I have difficulty in breathing, but did not realize any inconvenience \n\n\n                                     -302- \n\nthis time. We reached Cheyenne Thursday noon, but as it was snowing and cold we did not walk much that day.",
