    "word": "Did Jesus meet with no discouragement? Was He never disappointed in men? Oh yes, again and again and again! He kept steadfastly to the work of saving humanity. We must do as Christ did, with confidence and love for those for whom He died. All coldness and indifference in regard to the souls of our fellow men is a condemning sin. We must connect with Jesus Christ, and be like Him in character, unselfish, pure, holy, undefiled. We must be wide-awake to the interest and advancement of Christ's work.",
