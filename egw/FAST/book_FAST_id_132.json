    "word": "Sinners seldom feel right in regard to reproof. . . .How little sympathy they feel for the one who has carried the heavy load the Lord has laid upon him! They assume the role of a martyr and think they deserve great pity, because they are reproved and counseled contrary to their own ideas and feelings. They may admit some things, but with dogged persistency they hold fast to their errors, their own ideas. \u201cFor rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.\u201d To all intents and purposes the Word of God is rejected. . . .",
