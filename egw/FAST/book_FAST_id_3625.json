    "word": "We lose much, very much, by lack of love for our brethren and sisters. Our ministering brethren--by their unity, their steadfast love, their delicacy in dealing with their brethren, firmly sustaining one another, their forbearance and sympathy and tender compassion for each other--can give to the churches an example that will rightly represent the life of our Redeemer. The truth of God is not designed merely to deal with errors and vices, and the ministers to feel that they must be reined up to censure and condemn even if they see existing wrongs. Frequently the very best way to cure the evil is to let those who are wrong see the heart of the minister of God softened and tender and pitiful, His bosom full of the milk of human kindness.",
