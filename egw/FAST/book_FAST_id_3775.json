    "word": "There are great and important truths to be revealed, and these cannot be understood unless minds shall grasp them and love them. If we incorporate them into our lives, then, like an overflowing fountain, we will not be able to restrain them or bind them about. That which we have heard and seen and experienced will be to us a living reality, and we cannot but speak and write the things which we know, which have been stamped upon our mind's experience. [Let us] hold fast the profession of our faith, Christ dwelling in us by faith.",
