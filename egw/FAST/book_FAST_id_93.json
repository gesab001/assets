    "word": "Judas the betrayer did not forget the part he was to act. When the mob entered the garden, he had led the way, closely followed by the high priest. To the pursuers of Jesus he had given a sign, saying, \u201cWhomsoever I shall kiss, that same is He: hold Him fast.\u201d Matthew 26:48. Now he pretends to have no part with them. Coming close to Jesus, he takes His hand as a familiar friend. With the words, \u201cHail, Master,\u201d he kisses Him repeatedly, and appears to weep as if in sympathy with Him in His peril.",
