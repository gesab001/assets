    "word": "Daniel a Noble Example.--Nowhere shall we find a more comprehensive and forcible illustration of true temperance and its attendant blessings than in the history of the youthful Daniel and his associates in the court of Babylon. When they were selected to be taught the learning and tongue of the Chaldeans, that they might \"stand in the king's palace,\" \"the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank.\" \"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank.\" Not only did these young men decline to drink the king's wine, but they refrained from the luxuries of his table. They obeyed the divine law, both natural and moral. With their habits of self-denial were coupled earnestness of purpose, diligence, and steadfastness. And the result shows the wisdom of their course.",
