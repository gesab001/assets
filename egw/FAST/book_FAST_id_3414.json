    "word": "Rest in Christ's love, my sister. This is all that He requires of you. Look unto Jesus, not yourself Christ is the Author and Finisher of your faith. Trust the One who has helped you in the past to hold fast to the faith. In the hour of death Christ cried out, \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" Had God forsaken Him? No, no. Neither has He forsaken any soul who trusts in Him. He will bring them off victorious, and give them the crown of life.--Letter 299, 1904, p. 4. (To \"An Aged Sister,\" October 31, 1904.) Released November 10, 1975.",
