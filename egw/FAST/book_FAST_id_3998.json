We had to meet with prejudice and with ridicule and with sneers and with criticism of the very same character that we have had to meet here in this conference. The opposition seemed almost crushing in its influence. What if we had held our peace and been controlled by the ministers who thought we were heretics, disturbing the peace of churches? Nevertheless, we did move forward, and while many bent beneath the power of opposition and yielded their faith to preserve the unity with their brethren, and retained their place in the churches, many could not conscientiously do this. They held fast their faith. And what was the result? They were turned out of the churches.
