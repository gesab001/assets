    "word": "[Elder White:] \"Then at one time I remember very distinctly \n\n\n                -89- \n\nabout your saying that, 'As we approach nearer the end I have seen our camp meetings with less preaching and more Bible study; little groups all over the ground with their Bibles in their hands, and different ones leading out in a free conversational study of the Scriptures.'\"  {2SAT 88.10}  \n     [Sister White:] That is the work that has been shown me, that our camp meetings would increase in success and interest. There are those who want more definite light. There are some who take a longer time to get hold of things and get what you really mean. If they could have the privilege of having it made a little plainer, they would see that and would catch hold of that. It would be like a nail fastened in a sure place, and it would be written on the tablets of their hearts.",
