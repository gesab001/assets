    "word": "My soul is sick and discouraged in regard to those who have been so long rebellious in Waukon. \"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry\" (1 Samuel 15:23). Souls in Waukon have rebelled and stood fast in their rebellion, and very recently they have professed to see themselves, and their stubbornness is changed to a spirit of witchcraft or divination. I call upon all who have the cause of God one particle at heart to rise in the name of the Lord and put down the manifestations among them.",
