    "word": "Stephen committed the keeping of his soul to Him whom he saw in his yielding up his life. \"But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.\" He said \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\" He committed his soul unto Jesus. He only is able to take care of it. We are not our own selves able to appreciate or take care of our souls. And if we do not commit our souls to God in faith and trust every day, Satan himself will take the soul committed to his will. None should be entrusted with the soul but He [line left out] things we may say, \"My soul is as an angel before God: its worth I can only estimate by the cross of Calvary. It is more precious than gold, silver, and precious stones. Its value is to be estimated by the price paid to redeem it.\" [1 Peter 1:18-22, quoted.]",
