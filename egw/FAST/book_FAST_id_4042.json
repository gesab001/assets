    "word": "Those who entertain this belief, do not know who they are about. They are cherishing a love for darkness, and just as long as these Christless souls are retained in positions of responsibility, the cause of God is imperilled. They are in danger of fastening themselves so firmly with the dark leader of all rebellion, that they will never see light; and the longer they are retained, the more hopeless is their chance of receiving Christ, or of having a knowledge of the true God. How uncertain they make everything that is spiritual and progressive in the truth. Under the influence of their leader, they become more and more determined to work against Christ. But through good and bad report, through darkness, through all the antagonism of the agencies of Satan, the Sun of Righteousness calmly shines on, searching out evil, repressing sin, and reviving the Spirit of the humble and contrite ones. \"Lord, to whom shall we go:, thou hast \n                                                                           1600\nthe words of eternal life.\"",
