    "word": "Venturesome investments must be strictly avoided. Those that have been made in the past should never have been made. Let the workers in Nashville bind about the edges. Let them guard themselves as with a fence of barbed wire from the inclination to go into debt. Let them say firmly, \"Henceforth we will not advance any faster than the Lord shall indicate and the means in hand will allow, even though the good work has to wait for a while. In beginning the work in new places, we will do our work in narrow quarters rather than involve the Lord's work in debt.\"",
