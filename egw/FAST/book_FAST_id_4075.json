    "word": "We are today in great peril of following in false paths. If negotiations are made with the Wessels family, God must give direction as to how they shall be framed. Let all remember that this is a time when Satan is working to lead the Lord's people in various countries to tie themselves up as his people in America have done. There there is little freedom and little means because the conference, which in the fear of the Lord should have stood stedfast to principle, departed from the right way. Alliances with men need prayerful adjustment. We are God's stewards and are dealing with his money, with his talents. That which in our human judgment would appear to promise much at the beginning may through the unwise movements of some one in the alliance create much disappointment and endless perplexity.",
