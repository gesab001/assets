    "word": "Monday, Sept. 22, 1873. Willie started over the range today to either get supplies or get the axletree of the wagon Walling is making. We cannot either move on or return to our home at the Mills without our wagon. . . . There is very poor feed for the horses. Their grain is being used up. The nights are cold. Our stock of provisions is fast decreasing. . . . Willie and Brother Glover returned today. Brother Glover was on his way with the new axletree when Willie met him. . . . We were glad to see them and made preparations to start the next morning for Grand Lake in Middle Park. We had a cold night, but our noble bonfire of big logs and our little stove in the tent kept us comfortable.",
