    "word": "The long-expected day of God will soon test every man's work. \"The fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.\" In the great day of God the worthless material will be consumed; but the gold of true, simple, humble faith will never lose its value. It can never be consumed; for it is imperishable. All selfishness, all false religion, will then appear as they are. One hour of transgression will be seen to be a great loss, while the fear of the Lord will be seen to be the beginning of wisdom. The pleasure of self-indulgence will perish as stubble, while the gold of steadfast principle, maintained at any cost, will endure forever.--Ms 130, 1899, pp. 13, 14. (\"The Test of Obedience,\" typed September 8, 1899.)",
