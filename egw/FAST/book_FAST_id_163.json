    "word": "In history and prophecy the Word of God portrays the long, continued conflict between truth and error. That conflict is yet in progress. Those things that have been will be repeated. Old controversies will be revived, and new theories will be continually arising. But God\u2019s people, who in their belief in fulfillment of prophecy have acted a part in the proclamation of the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages, know where they stand. . . . They are to stand firm as a rock, holding the beginning of their confidence steadfast unto the end.",
