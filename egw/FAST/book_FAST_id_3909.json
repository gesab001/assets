    "word": "Brethren, those that have experience, come to the front. You that have professed the name of God in Battle Creek, I call upon you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to come to the front. We want the help of every soul. If you have a jot of influence, give it. Don't give your influence to tearing down. We need your influence to build up the cause of God, for I tell you the crisis is right upon us. We want now to be seeking God in our homes, with weeping and with fasting and with prayer.",
