    "word": "Now in regard to the school, you seem to think that the plant is to put forth full bloom, lilies, roses, and pinks before the root is fully set deep to do this grand work. You must begin small, and not think that you can show all strength in establishing a school after an advanced order, taking in higher studies, and do not worry about leading teachers or under teachers before you have sufficient students to warrant the steps you take. Let not human pride hurt your record. Do not you suppose the Lord sees and is acquainted with the favorable and unfavorable presentations? Has not the Lord an oversight over His own work? You may suppose, my brethren, that you have to do all the devising, all the strengthening, and all the organizing, and I ask you, Is it not best to show that you have confidence in God? Is it not best to consider that our God is manager--that He is director? You must not be anxious to develop too fast. The hand of providence is holding the machinery. When that hand starts the wheel then all things will begin to move.",
