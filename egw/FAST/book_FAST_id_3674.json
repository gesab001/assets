    "word": "You are not called upon to fast forty days. The Lord bore that fast for you in the wilderness of temptation. There would be no virtue in such a fast; but there is virtue in the blood of Christ. Will you not believe that there is power in His sacrifice to purify and refine you, power in His grace to make you a laborer together with God?--Letter 206, 1908. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May 7, 1987. Entire Letter.",
