    "word": "Walk in Christ's footsteps and hold fast that which you have received and heard, and put away any exposition of Scripture which means, \"My Lord delayeth His coming.\" In such a day as ye think not the Son of man cometh, and then how will it be with you and those whose minds you have confused? Stop right where you are, for God has not given you this message to bear to the people. Those who receive your interpretation of Scripture regarding the sanctuary service are receiving error and following in false paths. The enemy will work the minds of those who are eager for something new, preparing them to receive false theories and false expositions of the Scripture.",
