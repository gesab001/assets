    "word": "I can write no more now. I am bidden to present this to my brethren, for them to carry to others, who are not at this meeting. Work with all diligence in harmony with Christ. We have not a moment to spend in contention. Every soul is to be hidden with Christ in God. There is to be a time of trouble such as was not since there was a nation. Those who have any realization of this will not regard it as a virtue to make little differences a hindrance to their own spirituality and to the advancement of the work of God. Let the Lord's entrusted means be put in operation, that new fields may be opened. Let lines of work be set in operation to warn the cities and villages as fast as possible; for the time will soon be upon us when the enemy will imbue all wicked men with his devising. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him, and He will show them His covenant. God calls upon His people to assist with their means, that in the places which He has specified should be worked, there may be wise men to carry the work forward.",
