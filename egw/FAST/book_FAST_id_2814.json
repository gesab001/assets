    "word": "The Lord has given us the promise \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him\u201d (James 1:5). It is in the order of God that those who bear responsibilities should often meet together to counsel with one another, and to pray earnestly for that wisdom which He alone can impart. Talk less; much precious time is lost in talk that brings no light. Let church leaders unite in fasting and prayer for the wisdom that God has promised to supply liberally. Make known your troubles to God. Tell Him, as did Moses, \u201cI cannot lead this people unless Thy presence shall go with me.\u201d And then ask still more; pray with Moses, \u201cShew me thy glory\u201d (Exodus 33:18). What is this glory? The character of God. This is what He proclaimed to Moses.",
