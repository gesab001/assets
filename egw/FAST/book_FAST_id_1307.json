    "word": "Will you not, without delay, place yourself in right relation to God? Will you not say, \"I will give my will to Jesus, and I will do it now,\" and from this moment be wholly on the Lord's side? Disregard custom, and the strong clamoring of appetite and passion. Give Satan no chance to say, \"You are a wretched hypocrite.\" Close the door, so that Satan will not thus accuse and dishearten you. Say, \"I will believe, I do believe that God is my helper,\" and you will find that you are triumphant in God. By steadfastly keeping the will on the Lord's side, every emotion will be brought into captivity to the will of Jesus. You will then find your feet on solid rock. It will take, at times, every particle of will-power that you possess, but it is God that is working for you, and you will come forth from the molding process a vessel unto honor.",
