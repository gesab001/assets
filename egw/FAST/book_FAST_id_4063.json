    "word": "The physician should be a man of earnest prayer, that he may impart to others the light and hope and faith which he receives. He should himself possess the hope which is sure and steadfast, the hope that Jesus is a very present help in every time of trouble. He should reverence the Word of God. This Word is exceedingly precious to the receiver; for it sanctifies the soul. The Christian physician studies the Word of God, and is prepared to soothe those who are tossed by doubt and fear. He knows the value of the Redeemer's love and presence. He can speak with assurance of the soul hovering between \n\n\n                                   - 42 - \n\nlife and death.

Who knows but that the compassionate Saviour may speak the word, \"You shall live to sound forth my praises.\"",
