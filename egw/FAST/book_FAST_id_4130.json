Some who have stood in positions of sacred trust have sullied their integrity. They have not, in their individual responsibility, stood in moral power before God. Those who were not worthy have been flattered while those who have stood fast for truth and for righteousness, because their ideas did not agree with those of their brethren have been denounced, discredited, and misjudged. Evil has been imagined against them.",
