{"word": "In the introduction to his epistle, he asserted his own position as an apostle, \"not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.\" He had been commissioned by the highest authority, not of earth, but in Heaven. After giving his salutation to the church, he pointedly addresses them: \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel, which is not another.\" The doctrines which the Galatians had received, could not in any sense be called the gospel; they were the teachings of men, and were directly opposed to the doctrines taught by Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LP", "page": 189}
