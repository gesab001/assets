{"word": "Chap. Seventy-Four - Every Home a Church\n\n     Parents to Be God's Representatives.--Every family in the home life should be a church, a beautiful symbol of the church of God in heaven. If parents realized their responsibilities to their children, they would not under any circumstances scold and fret at them. This is not the kind of education any child should have. Many, many children have learned to be faultfinding, fretful, scolding, passionate children, because they were allowed to be passionate at home. Parents are to consider that they are in the place of God to their children, to encourage every right principle and repress every wrong thought.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 480}
