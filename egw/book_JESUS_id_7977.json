{"word": "I am so glad that we can come to God in faith and humility, and plead with Him until our souls are brought into such close relationship with Jesus that we can lay our burdens at His feet, saying, \"I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day\". The Lord is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think. Our cold, faithless hearts may be quickened into sensibility and life, until we can say in faith, \"The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God.\" Let us seek for the fullness of the salvation of Christ. Let us follow in the footsteps of the Son of God, for the promise is, \"He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\"--MS. 63, 1908.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 203}
