    "word": "My Instructor said, This in no case must be. They have had warnings in the past over and over again, for eighteen or twenty years, but have not fully heeded these warnings. There are those who have had no heart in the matter of moving out of Oakland, but have been opposing their resistance to the instructions that have been given; and their unbelief has strengthened with the spirit of opposition to the movement. The Lord's message was, \"Out of the cities; break up the continual temptation to engage in commercial business, which has been such a great injury to the work.\" A failure to heed the messages given, and repeated for years, has been a decided injury to the souls of many.--Ms 57, 1906, pp. 1, 2.
