    "word": "Here was one man in high position who had been entrusted with a vast amount of property. But upon an examination of his accounts he was found unfaithful; he owed his lord ten thousand talents. This, at the lowest computation, amounts to not less than fifteen million dollars. When the king saw the evidence of his servant's unfaithfulness he commanded him to be sold, with his wife and children, his house, his lands, and all that he had, that payment might be made. Alarm seized the unfaithful man as he saw the ruin before him, and he pleaded for delay: \"Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\" But his lord knew that he could never pay the debt. While the servant acknowledged the justice of the sentence against him, he begged for mercy. \"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.\"",
