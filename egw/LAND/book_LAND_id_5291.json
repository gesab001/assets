    "word": "Time is short, and that work which is essential must be done quickly. Satan has seen this, and he has worked with his deceptive, intriguing power to entangle everything in America, so that the work that you and others could and should have done, has been made impossible. And the work which should have been done in England has been blocked by the very same power that has swayed things in America. The wisdom of men disconnected and out of touch with the wisdom of God, the spirit of arbitrary authority which has manifested itself so decidedly in America, has not been confined to that country, but has extended its power to leaven other countries. I am afraid of the men who have moved like blind men. The cause and work of God demands men who will attend to the work God has given them; and had this been the case, men would have listened to the counsel of God, and not to the wisdom of fools, wise only in their own conceits.--Letter 71, 1898, pp. 1, 2. (To Brother and Sister W. W. Prescott, Aug. 27, 1898.)",
