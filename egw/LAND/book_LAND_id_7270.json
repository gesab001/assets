    "word": "Brother Ballenger, I am very desirous that the buildings and land that we designed to purchase shall not be allowed to pass into other hands. I think we ought to obtain this property, even if four thousand dollars are asked for it. If we had only purchased it before the rain came, what a good thing it would have been. We must ask the Lord so to arrange matters that we can obtain this property. We shall need every foot of the land.",
