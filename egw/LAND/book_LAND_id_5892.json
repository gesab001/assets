    "word": "En Route to Europe, 1885--(En route east) July 13, 1885: We left Oakland. There were twelve in our party. We were well accommodated. About twelve more occupied one end of the car until we reached Mojave. Then we changed cars, Wednesday noon. There were only three men in our car besides our party. The heat was very great, but we had no dust. We passed over heavy sand. We passed over a very large body of sand which was like a lake almost as white as snow.",
