    "word": "There should be a decided change in the spirit and character of the work, where men and women have received increased light. What are they doing to warn men and women who do not understand that the Lord is soon coming? He goeth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the world for their iniquity. \"The earth shall disclose her blood and no more cover her slain.\" Where, I asked, is the burden for souls that are perishing out of Christ? Who will go forth without the camp, bearing the reproach? Who will leave pleasant homes and dear ties of relationship, and carry the precious light of truth to far-off lands, but not beyond the domain of God? Every day and every moment comes to those who have entrusted to them the light of truth with the terrible significance that men and women in every clime and land are fitting themselves for weal or woe, fixing their own destinies for eternity.",
