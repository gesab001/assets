    "word": "Meeting Objections\n     Time and strength can be better employed than in dwelling at length upon the quibbles of our opponents who deal in slander and misrepresentations. While precious time is employed in following the crooks and turns of dishonest opponents, the people who are open to conviction are dying for want of knowledge. A train of senseless quibbles of Satan's own invention, is brought before minds, while the people are crying for food \u2014 for meat in due season.",
