    "word": "MR No. 623 - Publications for Non-SDA Readers\n\n     The cut in Gospel Reader--Moses Viewing the Promised Land--does great injustice to the subject. . . . What sort of an impression will it make on the readers of the book? It is not in any sense a correct representation of Moses. It looks more like a picture of the great deceiver, Satan, after he had lost Paradise.",
