    "word": "Parents. [Written from] Toowoomba, Queensland, September 20, 1899. The past night has been one of experience. I was standing in the council meeting at Battle Creek. The Spirit of the Lord was upon me. I said many words to the managers of the work. I will not here state the message I was burdened to bear. \n\n\n                                    -317- \n\nBut One, a heavenly messenger, stood before the people. We did not know when He came into the assembly. He said, \"As representative men, you do not understand the work for this time. You need to be converted. The soul temple needs to be cleansed. You do not see things clearly; you must have your eyes anointed. If you only knew yourselves, you would be alarmed.\"",
