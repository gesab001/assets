    "word": "Training of Students \n\n     Brother Sutherland, be careful not to go to opposite extremes. We very much dislike to present wrongs to be corrected, lest the opposite extreme shall be taken. You must not let the students suppose that their education is to be loose and haphazard. Let the students, the young especially, study books that are free from infidelity. As fast as possible let the youth perfect their knowledge of the common branches. Bring in the Word of God and its principles as the foundation of a solid education. Not all the youth are to receive a medical education in order to be fitted for labor. Young boys and girls need to go through the proper period of discipline in the study of the common branches and Bible lessons. But let them have no encouragement that they can engage in medical missionary work, unless they give evidence of thorough conversion.",
