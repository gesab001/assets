    "word": "There will no doubt always be difficulty in reaching the higher classes. But the truth will often find its way to the noblemen by first reaching the middle and poorer classes. This was the case in Paul's day. The truth entered Caesar's household through one who was held in bonds, and men and women of high rank became disciples of Christ. Some who are now employed in England as servants and ladies\u2019 maids are quietly working to get the truth before those for whom they labor. Thus through servants or relatives the truth will reach the honest-hearted among the highest as well as the lowest.",
