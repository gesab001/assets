    "word": "The Land Is to Be Our Lesson Book--Plans were laid to build cottages on the school campus [Avondale College]. I was glad I was here at the time that this subject was brought up, for I had something to say. I told them that the grounds were not to be occupied by buildings. The land is to be our lesson book. After being cleared, it is to be cultivated. Orange, lemon, peach, apricot, nectarine, plum, and apple trees are to occupy the land, with vegetable gardens, flower gardens, and ornamental trees. Thus this place is to be brought as near as possible to the presentation that \n\n\n                                   -186- \n\npassed before me several times, as the symbol of what our school and premises should be. Dwelling houses, fenced allotments for families were not to be near our school buildings. This place must by the appointment of God be a representation of what school premises should be--a delight to the eyes.",
