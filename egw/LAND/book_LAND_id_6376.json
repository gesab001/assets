    "word": "Sunday morning, May 6, we left Maitland to fill our appointment at Mount Vincent. Our meeting was held in the Good Templar's Hall, a small building. Brethren and sisters from Cooranbong met us at the hall. The attendance was good, better than we expected. There were thirty people from the neighborhood and fifteen of our people from Cooranbong, including ourselves. The Lord gave me freedom in speaking from 1 John 2:1-6. The best of attention was given by the youth as well as those of mature age. I had been invited to speak in this place some time ago, but this was the first time I responded. I do not think it will be the last.",
