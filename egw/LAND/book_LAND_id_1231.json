    "word": "In that day, multitudes will desire the shelter of God's mercy which they have so long despised. \u201cBehold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.\u201d [Amos 8:11, 12.]",
