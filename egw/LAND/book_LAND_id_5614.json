    "word": "When we landed on the ground to be explored, we found a blue-gum tree about one hundred feet long lying on the ground. There was a fire in the center, and the smoke came out of the forked ends, and the main trunk, which . . . formed three chimneys. Several feet of one fork was a burning mass of glowing coals. The day before Willie and Brother Reekie had taken their dinner at this place and had kindled a fire in a knot of wood and it had been burning ever since. There was no danger of setting the woods on fire, and it was a pretty sight. Willie, Emily, and I rested here for a little while, but the rest of the party took their shovels and went on to examine portions of the land that they had not yet passed over. The place where we tarried had a very nice grade. It was a ridge, not abrupt, but slightly elevated. Around us were immense trees that had been cut down and parts were taken out which could be used. I thought, if one of these trees could lie in our dooryard at Granville, we should not need to question as to where our fuel would come from; for we would have an abundance for a long time.",
