    "word": "MR No. 1259 - Earnest Effort Needed in the Cooranbong - Maitland - Newcastle Area\n\n     (Written September 12, 1899, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, New South Wales, to \"Dear Son Edson.\") \n     Be careful how you move. The last move you made in reference to your boat resulted in injury to yourself. Your course of action must not be a temptation to those who would excuse their neglect of the field where you have worked so hard. Do not give them a semblance of excuse for selfishness and hardheartedness. Do not lay a stumbling block in their path. This is the work of the enemy, and he is a wonderfully skillful worker. You are now to seek the Lord as never before. \"Make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way\" [Hebrews 12:13].",
