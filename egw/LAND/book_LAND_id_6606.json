Our reward will be proportionate to our work. \"My reward is with Me,\" Christ declares, \"to give unto every man according as his work shall be.\" Let all who can, go forth to work in wisdom and grace and the love of Christ for those nigh and afar off. The Master calls for every man to do the work given him according to his several ability.--Letter 131, 1900. \n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nApril 18, 1991. Entire Letter.",
