    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     In England a minister went to his church to preach one rainy morning, and found that he had only one man for audience. But he would not disappoint his hearer, and he preached to him with earnestness and interest. As a result the man was converted, and became a missionary, and through his efforts thousands heard the good news of salvation. One discourse did the work for him, and he gathered abundantly for the Master.",
