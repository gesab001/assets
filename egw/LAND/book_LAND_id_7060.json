We left St. Helena on Friday morning to spend Sabbath and Sunday in Oakland. I spoke both afternoons in the tent. On Sabbath afternoon the tent was filled, mostly with our own people; and all present were interested. I had special freedom in speaking from the seventh chapter of Revelation. This is a most interesting chapter.",
