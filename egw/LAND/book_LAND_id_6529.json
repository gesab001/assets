Kellogg.) \n\n\n     I thought I should have time to write you a letter to go by this mail, but we were fully employed in writing to Africa, and then word came to us from Brother Haskell that he had arrived in Sydney last Sabbath from New Zealand, and would very much like to converse with me in reference to furnishing the Health Home. In three hours we were speeding to the train with our fastest team, conjecturing all the four miles and a half whether or not we would be able to catch the train to Sydney. We were in season, the train was out of season--delayed in Newcastle, twenty miles from Morisset Station. We reached Strathfield, changed cars for Summer Hill, and arrived at the Health Home at 11:00 o'clock p.m.",
