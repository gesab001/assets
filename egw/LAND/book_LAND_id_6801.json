    "word": "I found a retired home in the Oakland Mission. Bro. and Sister McClure were attentive to my every want. I was not made strong at once, but the Lord gave me strength and grace to be upon the camp-ground a part of the time, and to bear my testimony before the people. The burden of the work was rolled upon me, and although unable to sit up much of the time, I labored in public, and with individuals. I felt great burden of soul for certain cases, especially for some in the ministry whose condition had been presented before me, and I knew that they were unfitted to minister to the flock of God, until they were transformed by the divine grace and power of God. The truth preached to others was not permitted to sanctify their own souls. Their changeable, unconsecrated life was a stumbling block to many, and they were like guide posts pointing the wrong way, and directing souls on the road to death. How I longed to have the spirit of God do a work in that meeting which God alone could do, that souls who were blinded by the enemy, walking in the sparks of their own kindling, might realize their condition and be saved. In the fear of God, I had counseled, warned, entreated and reproved when under the influence of the Spirit of God, but the testimony had been unheeded.",
