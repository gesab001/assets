    "word": "Counsels After Pacific Press Fire. [BECAUSE IT OFTEN INTERFERED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF DENOMINATIONAL PUBLICATIONS, THE LARGE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL WORK BEING DONE AT THE PACIFIC PRESS CREATED A GROWING PROBLEM. EVENTUALLY, IN RESPONSE TO ELLEN G. WHITE'S COUNSEL, THE BOARD VOTED IN 1902 TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF COMMERCIAL WORK. SINCE BY THIS TIME THE CITY OF OAKLAND HAD GROWN UP AROUND THE PLANT, THE BOARD ALSO TOOK ACTION TO SEEK A RURAL SITE FOR A NEW PLANT. THIS DECISION RESULTED IN THE REMOVAL TO MOUNTAIN VIEW, 38 MILES SOUTH OF SAN FRANCISCO, IN 1904.
