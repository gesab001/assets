BELDEN, THE WELL-KNOWN HYMN WRITER, WAS THEIR SON.  SARAH DIED IN 1868.  STEPHEN WAS LIVING WITH HIS THIRD WIFE ON NORFOLK ISLAND, NORTHEAST OF AUSTRALIA, WHEN THESE LETTERS WERE WRITTEN.] \n\n\n     Be assured that I do not forget you.  I pray for you, that the Lord will open up ways whereby you will be enabled to do good on Norfolk Island.  I shall try to send you some money now and then.  All that I have sent you since coming to this country has been hired on interest, but while I live, I will care for you. May the Lord give you peace and comfort.  He is our only Hope and our only Helper.  I shall be glad to hear from you as often as you can write, and I will write to you as often as I can. When it is not possible for me to write I will communicate to you through others.  In this mail I will send you copies of letters I have written to the brethren in Australia. -Letter 146, 1902.",
