    "word": "While in southern California I spent three weeks at San Diego, in the new sanitarium in Paradise Valley, which is soon to be opened for the reception of patients. The lack of water was the only thing against the use of this place for sanitarium purposes. I am glad to be able to tell you that an abundant supply of soft, pure water has been obtained. A well 95 feet deep has been dug on the lower part of the sanitarium land. When the workmen had gone down about 80 feet they found some water, and they went on digging through the clay to the gravel below. One morning Brother Palmer came to my room, his face full of joy, to tell us that a stream of water as big as his hand was running into the well. The next morning there was 14 feet of water in the well.",
