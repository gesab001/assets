    "word": "JEHOSHAPHAT'S PRAYER GIVES THE TRUE IDEA OF THE RELATION OF THAT LAND TO THE SANCTUARY: \u201cART NOT THOU OUR GOD, WHO DIDST DRIVE OUT THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND BEFORE THY PEOPLE ISRAEL, AND GAVEST IT TO THE SEED OF ABRAHAM THY FRIEND FOREVER? AND THEY DWELT THEREIN, AND HAVE BUILT THEE A SANCTUARY THEREIN FOR THY NAME.\u201d 2 CHRONICLES 20:7, 8. THIS CORRESPONDS TO THE COMMAND IN EXODUS 25:8: \u201cAND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY; THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG THEM.\u201d IN THIS SAME BOOK IS GIVEN A MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF THE SANCTUARY, ITS ERECTION, AND APPROVAL BY THE LORD. THE PROCESS OF CLEANSING THE SANCTUARY IS DESCRIBED IN LEVITICUS 16. WHILE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL POSSESSED CANAAN, SOLOMON BUILT A TEMPLE, IN WHICH WAS A HOLY AND A MOST HOLY PLACE; AND THE VESSELS OF THE MOVABLE SANCTUARY, WHICH WAS MADE IN THE DESERT OF SINAI, WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE TEMPLE. THIS WAS THEN THE SANCTUARY,\u2014THE DWELLING-PLACE OF GOD'S GLORY UPON THE EARTH.",
