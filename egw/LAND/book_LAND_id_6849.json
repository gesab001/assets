SWIFT DIED AT CLEVELAND, OHIO, OCT. 23, 1889, AND WAS BURIED IN BATTLE CREEK OCTOBER 25, AND A FUNERAL DISCOURSE WAS DELIVERED SABBATH AFTERNOON, OCTOBER 26.--REVIEW AND HERALD, NOV. 26, 1889, P. 750; NOV. 5, 1889, P. 696.] This day a fellow laborer was brought in his coffin from Ohio to this place to be buried in Battle Creek. Brother Swift died in Ohio October 23. The delegates, one hundred and thirty-two in number, walked in procession to Oak Hill Cemetery, while fifteen carriages slowly moved on their way, to lay the body in the vault. It was a solemn sight to see this large number with the funeral badges, following their brother, now silent in death in his coffin. Oh, it is a sad thing that one of the earnest, faithful workers will no more be present at our General Conferences, to bear his testimony!",
