    "word": "\"Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings:  and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob. For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron:  I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee:  but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.\" Isaiah 60:16-19.",
