    "word": "There were good high grounds in East Maitland but we wanted to find a place in West Maitland where there is the largest population. We drove around for nearly three hours and found that all the unoccupied ground around West Maitland is low and subject to floods. In past years this city has suffered greatly from the floods, and about four weeks ago much of the land around the city was under water. At last we gave up the effort to find a campground nearer than that which Elder Starr had selected, near East Maitland. This matter settled, we drove rapidly to the five o'clock train, which we reached just in time to get on board. I found room to lie down and slept a portion of the way. At nine-thirty we reached Strathfield, where we were met by Brother J. J. Wessels, who took us to his home. I thought it was a pretty busy day for one seventy-two years old.",
