    "word": "JUST BEFORE THE GENERAL MEETING AT LOMA LINDA HELD IN MAY, 1910, WHEN SISTER WHITE WAS AGAIN WITH US, SHE EXPRESSED THE CONVICTION THAT WE SHOULD SECURE THE PROPERTY IN FRONT OF THE SANITARIUM. WE TOLD HER IT HAD NEARLY DOUBLED IN VALUE SINCE WE PURCHASED LOMA LINDA. NEVERTHELESS SHE EXPRESSED HER ANXIETY THAT WE SHOULD SECURE THESE LANDS SO CLOSE TO THE INSTITUTION. WE THEN OBTAINED AN OPTION ON THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACRES LYING WEST OF PEPPER DRIVE, OR THAN PORTION THAT REMAINED UNSOLD, AT $250 AN ACRE. WHILE WAITING FOR THE GENERAL MEETING TO CONVENE IN MAY, THE PARTIES WERE ABOUT TO BACK OUT ON THEIR OPTION, SO THE LOCAL BOARD TOOK THE MATTER UNDER ADVISEMENT AND COMPROMISED BY SECURING THIRTY-SIX ACRES OF THE PROPERTY LYING NORTH OF THE RAILWAY, AT $225 AN ACRE, AND PURCHASED MOST OF THE ACREAGE THAT HAD BEEN SOLD OFF IN FRONT OF THIS PIECE ALONG PEPPER DRIVE, PAYING $500 AND $600 AN ACRE FOR IT.",
