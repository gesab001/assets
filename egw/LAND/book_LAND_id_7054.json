    "word": "Loma Linda cost us forty thousand dollars. The original (297) cost was nearly three times this sum. There were seventy-six acres of land in the tract, and thirty have been added since. As a sanitarium site, the property is a valuable one. The grounds have been carefully laid out at great expense to the original owners, and are beautified by well-kept lawns and flower-gardens. The surrounding scenery varies, in many respects from that seen from the grounds of the New England Sanitarium; but the extensive view is fully as magnificent as the Melrose view. There is more improved land about Loma Linda, including many square miles of bearing orange groves. Like Melrose, one of the chief advantages of situation at Loma Linda is the pleasing variety of charming scenery. We believe that both places have come into our possession to be used to the very best advantage possible for sanitarium purposes.",
