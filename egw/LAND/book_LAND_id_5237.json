    "word": "God sent a word of comfort to the bereaved mothers of Bethlehem that the weeping Rachels should see their children coming from the land of the enemy. \n\n\n                                     -148- \n\nChrist took little children in His arms and blessed them and rebuked the disciples who would send away the mothers, saying, \"Suffer little children and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\" Christ blessed the children brought to Him by the faithful mothers. He will do this now if mothers will do their duty to their children and teach their children and educate them in obedience and submission. Then they will bear the test and will be obedient to the will of God, for parents stand in the place of God to their children.",
