    "word": "The Lord has thought it essential to give reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness on many things in regard to the management of schools among Seventh-day Adventists. All the light that has been given must be carefully heeded. No man or woman should be connected with our schools as educators, who have not had an experience in obeying the Word of God. That which the Lord has spoken in the instruction given to our schools is to be strictly regarded: for if there is not, in some respects, an education of altogether a different character in our schools than has been given in Battle Creek, then we need not get to the expense of purchasing land, and erecting school buildings.",
