    "word": "As the children of Israel celebrated the deliverance that God wrought for their fathers, and His miraculous preservation of them during their journeyings from Egypt to the Promised Land, so should the people of God at the present time gratefully call to mind the various ways He has devised to bring them out from the world, out from the darkness of error, into the precious light of truth. . . . We should gratefully regard the old waymarks, and refresh our souls with memories of the loving-kindness of our gracious Benefactor. . . .",
