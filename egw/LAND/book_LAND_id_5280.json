    "word": "The work has moved slowly in England, unbelief has exerted its power to retard the work in various ways. Satan is doing his utmost to barricade the way, and not all who are engaged in the work have a decided wholeness for God, so that He can use them as chosen vessels. It is a serious matter when there is not a thorough consecration of heart, mind, and the whole being to God so that the strong human will is submerged in the will of God. Self has had much to do with the work. If self had been hid in Christ, the workers would have submitted their individual plans to God, would have moved in His way.",
