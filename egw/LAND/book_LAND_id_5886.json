    "word": "On the Train, Nearing Chicago, 1875--I left Oakland none too soon. We have had the most favorable, pleasant trip across the plains this time that we ever had. There has been no dust or cinders. Our companion travelers have been, with scarcely an exception, agreeable, very courteous. We have not been crowded any of the way. Some have kept their berths made up all day. We have had an entire section to ourselves. I am rested on this journey and shall step off the car with improved health.--Letter 15, 1875, pp. 1-2. (To Edson and Willie White, May 4, 1875.)",
