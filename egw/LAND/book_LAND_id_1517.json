    "word": "Appearance of the Country\n     A large part of Sweden is lowland, yet it has mountains so high as to be covered with eternal snows. There are extensive forests of spruce and hemlock, and a great number of beautiful lakes. It is said that one-tenth of the entire area is covered with lakes. The larger of these have been connected by canals, so that small ships can cross the country, from Stockholm on the east coast to Gottenberg on the west. These numerous bodies of water serve to moderate the climate, which, from the position of the country, would naturally be very severe.",
