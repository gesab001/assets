    "word": "MR No. 1108 - Look to Jesus, Not to Anna Phillips\n\n     (Written November 1, 1893, from Gisborne, New Zealand, to Brother and Sister Rice.) \n\n\n     I have thought I should get time to write to you ere this. Letters have come to me presenting before me the case of Sister Phillips, and inquiries have been made to me what I thought of the matter. I have not felt called out to encourage or condemn so long as I had no special light in reference to this case, but I now feel constrained to write. Matters have been presented before me which I will now mention. I can have time to express the matter only briefly.",
