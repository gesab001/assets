    "word": "During my visit to the Southern field a year ago, we tried to find, near Nashville, a property suitable for a sanitarium. We examined several places, but arrived at no definite decision. Recently I have been rejoiced to learn that there has been found a desirable property four miles south of the city, and near the terminus of a street-car line. In this tract there are thirty-three acres of land. Our brethren regard the location as an ideal site for a sanitarium. [THIS PROPERTY, KNOWN AS THE RENALLIS PLACE THOUGH PURCHASED AND HELD FOR A TIME, WAS AFTERWARD RELEASED, AS ANOTHER PROPERTY EVEN MORE SUITABLE WAS FOUND AND SECURED.] An ample supply of water comes from a lithia spring, pure, and clear as crystal.",
