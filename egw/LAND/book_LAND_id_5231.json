    "word": "Kettering, England, June 30, 1887. We slept but little the past night. Suffered with heat. We have fair weather in England this time of the year. I arose at four. Have been awake since three o'clock. Engaged in writing. Corrected several morning talks given in Basel. We learned here that the party who left Christiania--Elder Waggoner, W. C. White, Elder Whitney, Elder Haskell--were all very sick. They had a very rough passage on the Baltic Sea. . . . We walked out and did some purchasing in the city in the great market place. Purchased shoes. . . .",
