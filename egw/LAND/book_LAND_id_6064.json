Kellogg.) \n\n\n     W.C.W. must meet the Pitcairn when it should arrive, for trouble was in the ship's crew. And there must be changes made in the seamen, and W.C.W. received many letters from Captain and passengers. He must also counsel with the Auckland people, and get their consent to have the [camp] meeting held in or near Wellington. Telegram received that they consented; and W.C.W. went on to Kaeo to see the brethren there, and also that the Pitcairn would call near Kaeo. Here we are soon to be engaged in another camp meeting.--Letter 36, 1893, p. 3. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. September 27, 1984",
