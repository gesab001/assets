    "word": "Ananias and his wife Sapphira had the privilege of hearing the gospel preached by the apostles. . . . While under the direct influence of the Spirit of God, they made a pledge to give to the Lord certain lands; but when they were no longer under this heavenly influence, the impression was less forcible, and they began to question and draw back from fulfilling the pledge which they had made. . . . Covetousness was first cherished; then, ashamed to have their brethren know that their selfish souls grudged that which they had solemnly dedicated and pledged to God, deception was practiced. . . . When convicted of their falsehood, their punishment was instant death.",
