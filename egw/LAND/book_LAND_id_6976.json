    "word": "\"Judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter. Yea, the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. . . . According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.\"",
