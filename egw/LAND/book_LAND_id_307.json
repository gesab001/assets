PREDICTING THE COMING OF THE MESSIAH, HE SAID, \"THE LORD THY GOD WILL RAISE UP UNTO THEE A PROPHET FROM THE MIDST OF THEE, OF THY BRETHREN, LIKE UNTO ME; UNTO HIM YE SHALL HEARKEN.\" DEUTERONOMY 18:15. GOD GAVE MANY REVELATIONS TO THIS FAITHFUL MAN; AND THOUGH THE DIVINE GLORY WAS NOT FULLY REVEALED TO HIM, YET THE WORD DECLARES THAT GOD TALKED WITH HIM \"FACE TO FACE.\" DEUTERONOMY 34:10.",
