    "word": "In pursuit of Israel the vast armies of Egypt ventured to traverse the sea by the same path. A dark cloud was before them, and yet they pressed on. When the whole army\u2014\u201call Pharaoh\u2019s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen\u201dwere in the very bed of the sea, the Lord said unto Moses, \u201cStretch out thine hand over the sea.\u201d Israel had passed over on dry land, but they heard the shouting of the armies in pursuit. As Moses stretched out his rod over the sea, the embanked waters that had stood as a great wall rolled on in their natural course. Of all the men of Egypt in that vast army, not one escaped. All perished in their determination to have their own way and to refuse God\u2019s way. That occasion was the end of their probation.",
