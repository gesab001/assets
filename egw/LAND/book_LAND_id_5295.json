    "word": "We drove directly from the station to the house which has been rented for us in Takoma Park. This is a three-story building standing in about ten acres of land, and is built on the highest rise of ground near here. Five hundred feet below and six miles away is the city of Washington, reached either by the streetcar or the train. The house is very comfortable. I have a room nearly as large as my room at home.--Letter 141, 1904, pp. 1-7. (To Edson and Emma White, April 27, 1904.)",
