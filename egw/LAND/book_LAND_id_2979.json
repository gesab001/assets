    "word": "\"My herb drink.\"--We need not go to China for our tea, or to Java for our coffee. Some have said: \"Sister White uses tea, she keeps it in her house;\" and that she has placed it before them to drink. They have not told the truth because I do not use it, neither do I keep it in my house. Once when crossing the waters I was sick and could retain nothing on my stomach and I did take a little weak tea as a medicine, but I don't want any of you again to make the remark \n                                                                           302\nthat \"Sister White uses tea.\" If you will come to my house I will show you the bag that contains my herb drink. I send to Michigan, across the mountains, and get the red-clover top. In regard to coffee, I never could drink it, so those who reported that Sister White drinks coffee made a mistake.-- Manuscript 3, 1888 (Sermon, Oakland, California).",
