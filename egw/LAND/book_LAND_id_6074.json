    "word": "We found the workmen busy digging a well on the lower part of the land. This work has gone forward successfully, without incident of any kind, and I am very glad to be able to tell you that a good supply of soft, pure water has been found. The workmen went down 90 feet, and one morning, when they went to work, they found 18 feet of water in the well, with all their tools at the bottom. That morning Brother Palmer and your father came to my room, \n\n\n                                   -233- \n\ntheir faces lighted up with smiles, to tell me about the water in the well. Oh, I wish you could have seen the joy in their faces.",
