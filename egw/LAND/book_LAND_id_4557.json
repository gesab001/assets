    "word": "Most Poor Could Help Themselves.--There are very few in our land of plenty who are really so poor as to need help. If they would pursue a right course, they could in almost every case be above want. My appeal to the rich is, Deal liberally with your poor brethren, and use your means to advance the cause of God. The worthy poor, those who are made poor by misfortune and sickness, deserve your special care and help. \"Finally be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another; love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous.\"--Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 481.",
