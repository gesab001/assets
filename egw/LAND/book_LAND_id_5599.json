    "word": "Large tracts of beautiful land lie uncleared, unworked. The timber business has brought the settlers a meager pittance, and almost every day we see a drove of bullocks used to draw one, or sometimes two or three large logs. We count six, seven, or eight span, moving slowly along with their burden. Six span of bullocks were used to plow our land for cultivation. They are under discipline, and will move at a word and a crack of a whip, which makes a sharp report, but does not touch them. They wheel into line when it seems that they must get tangled up, but the creatures understand their business, and they plod patiently with the immense plow used to break up the unworked soil.",
