    "word": "The ride from London to Dover occupied several hours, and was very pleasant. Although it was September, the country through which we passed looked as fresh and green as though it had been spring-time. This formed a striking contrast to the dry, brown fields of a rainless California autumn, and is no doubt due in a large degree to the humid climate of England. Were it not for the numerous manufacturing towns and villages thickly dotted here and there, the country would seem like one vast park, as everything is kept in such a high state of cultivation.",
