    "word": "For many years there has not been a special work carried forward, and now we are here and much light has been given me recently that Portland and these cities in the Eastern States, that ought to have been labored for many years ago, must be worked. For years very little has been done to build up the work that ought to have been done in many places. Proper men should have been duly appointed and special efforts made, and not leave such a place almost destitute of help. Workers must now be appointed who will make most determined efforts, working and praying and drawing in even cords. Men must be appointed who will first lay hold of the Lord's gracious promises and then, under subjection to the Holy Spirit, do the very work which has been neglected--build a church or hire a suitable place to build up the work, all under the Holy Spirit's guidance.",
