    "word": "At the station, an effort was made to \u201ccheck\u201d the trunks to Basle. But on the English roads there are no checks. After we had paid for all that was in excess of fifty-five pounds for each ticket, they pasted onto each piece of baggage two strips of paper, one with the word \u201cBasle\u201d written on it, the other containing the number \u201c103.\u201d To us they gave one of the papers numbered \u201c103\u201d, after they had written on it the number of pieces we had left in their charge. This is the nearest thing to our American checking system that is to be found in Europe. And on many of the local roads in England, even this is not practiced. There each person has to look out for his own \u201cluggage,\u201d as it is called, and see that it is put in and taken out at the right station.",
