    "word": "The truth which we profess will be of no avail to us unless we are sanctified through it. . . . While error is prevailing to such an extent in our land, we want to know what is truth, because we cannot be sanctified by error. The better we understand the truth as it is in God's Word, the better we shall know how to sanctify our lives through God's Word.",
