    "word": "MR No. 266 - The Roth Family\n\n     I carried a heavy burden while in Europe, and while there I left about two thousand [dollars] of the Lord's entrusted money to advance the work in its different branches. I accepted the charge of Mary and her brother Paul from the hands of a very dear family who love and fear God, pledging myself to be their friend and do to the utmost of my influence to see that they were properly cared for, and that Mary should at my expense receive treatment at the sanitarium at Battle Creek and that Paul, who is a conscientious young man, should be placed where he could be qualifying himself to become a laborer in Switzerland or wherever duty may call him to labor. Those who have shared with me in this work I am truly grateful to, for I consider it a good work.--Letter 4, 1888, p. 1. (To \"Dear Brother and Sister W. W. Prescott, September 10, 1888.)",
