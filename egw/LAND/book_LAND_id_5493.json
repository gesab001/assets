    "word": "Two years ago I purchased a horse for forty dollars. She was a good-looking gray horse, but was very poor, and for a time it was a question as to whether or not I should give her away or what I would do with her; but kind treatment, and plenty of good feed have brought her up both in flesh and spirits. She has paid her way in one year. At one conference she transported our ministers from Prahan to North Fitzroy, and thus saved the conference twenty-five dollars in carfare. When I went to New Zealand, the school needed \n\n\n                                     -136- \n\nher, and she served them well. When I returned, she was in good condition. She is a perfectly safe animal, frightened at nothing, and is not up to any mean tricks. We transported her to New South Wales. She has had an attack of rheumatism, and for weeks we have been unable to use her. Your Uncle Belden went to the stockyard sale in Sydney, and from a herd of wild horses selected a horse for me for which he paid five pounds--twenty-five dollars. I paid three pounds for breaking the horse. So I have now a three-year-old colt which I put by the side of Maggie, and so have a nice team to draw my phaeton.--Letter 89a, 1894, pp. 4, 5, 9, 10. (To Edson and Emma White, August 22, 1894.)",
