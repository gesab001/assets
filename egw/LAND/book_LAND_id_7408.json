Moran, \n          315 West Third Street \n                Los Angeles, California \n\nDear Brother Magan:-- \n     Your letter from Chicago received yesterday. I am very sorry that circumstances have taken the shape that they have, but why are you so faithless? Thank the Lord that you have few students, because you are not prepared for a large number. Brother Sutherland and yourself have done bravely and well, and why will you worry yourself out of the arms of your precious Saviour? Has the bank of heaven failed? Have you overdrawn the resources? Is Christ, the Light of the World, in Joseph's new tomb? Do we not read, \"Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by Him, seeing that He ever liveth to make intercession for them?",
