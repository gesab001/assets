    "word": "Areas of Special Instruction in SDA Schools--Thorough instruction will be given in Bible Study, physiology, the history of our message; and special instruction will be given regarding the cultivation of the land. It is hoped that many of these students will eventually connect with schools in various places in the South. In connection with these schools there will be land that will be cultivated by teachers and students, and the proceeds from this work will be used for the support of the schools.--Letters 215, 1904, p. 10.
