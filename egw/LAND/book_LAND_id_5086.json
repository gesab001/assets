    "word": "Healdsburg, Cal. Aug. 10, 1888. \n     Dear Brother and Sister Daniels: I have not yet received the letter which I sent you from Burrough \n\n\n                      [58] \n\nValley. I requested that it should be sent to me. Will you please send it, for I am anxious to see the character of the letter I wrote to you, which brought the answer you sent me in return. I asked you to return it to me, or a copy of it, but probably you have forgotten all about it. I would be pleased to have you send me a copy of the letter which I sent you from Basel, Switzerland, for the Healdsburg church. Sister Daniels said that she had the letter, or a copy of it. I am anxious to hear from you. How is Sister Daniels? Was she very sick.",
