    "word": "In the night season a representation had been given me that revealed this lack of faith. I seemed to be on the Avondale land, and while the horses were breaking away through the forest, I walked in an open space \n\n\n                                   -56- \n\nclose to where our school buildings now stand. I saw a furrow made in the soil one foot deep and about four in length. Two of the brethren stood at the furrow, one at each end; they were examining the soil, and declaring it to be of no value. But one stood by who said, \"You have misjudged the worth of this land.\" He then explained the value of the different strata in the soil and their uses.",
