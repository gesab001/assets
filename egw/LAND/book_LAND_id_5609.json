    "word": "MR No. 563 - Visit To Waitsburg, Washington\n\n     We are in Waitsburg [Washington], a small town surrounded by hills. It is a very pleasant place. The trees and hills are beautifully green. Walla Walla is twenty miles from here, and we think now of leaving here Thursday morning, call at Walla and see the school, and in the evening take a sleeper for Portland.",
