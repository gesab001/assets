    "word": "I will write no more now. It is just daylight. I must write a few words to Edson. Be sure and see Edson. Do not neglect this. Please read this to Edson and please see that he has all the matter I send you to read. Herbert [Lacey] is at the health home. Lillian is with me. He is reduced to skin and bones. The case is critical, but I believe the Lord will raise him up. We are praying for him. He is having everything done for him possible. Sara returned evening after the Sabbath and bears the report I now give you. She could not do anything. Brother Semmens gives his whole time to the sick man, and they are having Dr. Deek, who is watching the case of the hygienic methods of treatment with great interest. He says he is doing just as well as he could possibly do under this attack.--Letter 181, 1897. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nDecember 13, 1990. Entire Letter.",
