    "word": "May Walling came home to me last Friday morning from Nevada. She looks strong and I think her stay there has not done her any harm. I am glad to have her here.

I tell May I will give her two \n\n\n                                     -324- \n\ndollars per week with which she can get her clothing, or a portion of it. Brother Lockwood, Sister Lockwood, and I will go over to St. Helena tomorrow, or Wednesday. Willie is at Oakland. He left Healdsburg this morning in answer to a call to attend an important business meeting in Oakland. W. C.

He has no desire to go, but what does the Lord want is the question.",
