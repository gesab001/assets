    "word": "\"The school is the Lord's property, and the grounds about it are his farm, where the great Sower can make his garden a lesson book. The results of the labor will be seen, first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. The land will yield its treasures, bringing the joyousness of an abundant harvest, and the produce gathered, through the blessing of the Lord, is to be used as nature's lesson book, from which spiritual lessons can be made plain and applied to the necessities of the soul. . . . There needs to be patient, painstaking effort made for the uplifting of the surrounding communities and for their education in industrial and sanitary lines. The school and everything connected with it should be object lessons, teaching the ways to improve, and appealing to the people for reform, so that taste, industry, and refinement may take the place of coarseness, uncleanness, disorder, ignorance, and sin.\"--P.C. \"The Avondale School Farm.\"",
