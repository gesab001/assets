    "word": "God has a faithful people upon the earth. The company of the Lord's precious ones are not now all in sight to be distinguished and counted. They are hidden now, but the proclamation of the third angel's message is to bring them to sight ere long. We are becoming acquainted \n\n\n                                     -11- \n\nwith some of these precious hidden ones, and my soul is glad that they take their position firmly and gladly. Thus it has been in Maitland. Said our Lord, \"I give unto them eternal life; ... neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand\" [John 10:28].--Letter 254, 1899. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. October 20, 1988. Entire Letter.",
