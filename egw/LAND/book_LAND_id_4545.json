    "word": "Women Can Reach Hearts.--To these our friends who expect soon to go from us to other lands I wish to say: \"Remember that you can break down the severest opposition by taking a personal interest in the people whom you meet. Christ took a personal interest in men and women while He lived on this earth. Wherever He went He was a medical missionary. We are to go about doing good, even as He did. We are instructed to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and comfort the sorrowing.\"",
