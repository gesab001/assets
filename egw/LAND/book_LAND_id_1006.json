    "word": "In the capital of strength a precious talent has been entrusted to men for labor. This is of more value than any bank deposit, and should be more highly prized. . . . It is a blessing that cannot be purchased with gold or silver, houses or lands; and God requires it to be used wisely. No man has a right to sacrifice this talent to the corroding influence of inaction. All are as accountable for the capital of physical strength as for their capital of means. . . .",
