    "word": "The redeemed will meet and recognize those whose attention they have directed to the uplifted Saviour. What blessed converse they have with these souls! \u201cI was a sinner,\u201d it will be said, \u201cwithout God and without hope in the world, and you came to me and drew my attention to the precious Saviour as my only hope. . . .\u201d Others will say, \u201cI was a heathen in heathen lands.

I am saved, eternally saved, ever to behold Him whom I love. . . .\u201d",
