    "word": "Traveling by Train From San Francisco to Battle Creek, 1873-- Thursday, Feb. 27, 1873: Left San Francisco at 7:00 a.m. We arose at five o'clock to get our breakfast, finish our packing, and get to the boat which took us to Oakland. The people were unwilling to let us leave them, but as there was no one to accompany my husband we felt that it must be right for us to go with him. We took seats in the cars at Oakland at 8:00 a.m. We had a stateroom, retired if we chose to be [apart] from the passengers. I was sick in consequence of passengers being allowed to smoke on the cars. I could not eat; lay down much of the time. We passed much beautiful scenery. Passed Cape Horn, a most romantic and fearful spot, about dark. We felt to lift our hearts to God for His care and protection on the journey, especially in passing such dangerous places. \n\n\n                                -120-",
