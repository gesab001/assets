    "word": "The cars had run about three miles from Jackson when their motion became very violent, jerking backward and forward, and finally stopped. I raised the window and saw a car standing upon one end, and heard most distressing groans and great confusion. The engine had been thrown off the track. But the car we were in was on the track, and was \n                                                                           190\nseparated from those before it about one hundred feet. The express car was crushed to pieces, the goods scattered, and many of them destroyed. The baggage car not much injured, and our large trunk of books was safe. The second-class car was crushed, and the pieces, with the passengers in it, were thrown from the track on both sides of it. The car in which we tried to get a seat was much broken, and one end was raised upon the heap of ruins. The coupling did not break, but the cars separated, as if an angel had unfastened them. Another train was expected in a few minutes, and the greatest excitement was raised. The broken pieces of the cars were used to build a large fire, and men with torches went upon the track in the direction the cars were expected. We hastily left the car, and my husband took me in his arms and carried me, wading in the water, and placed me upon the fence, got over, then carried me across a swampy piece of land to the main road. Four were killed or mortally wounded. One of them was the young bookbinder referred to. Many were much injured.",
