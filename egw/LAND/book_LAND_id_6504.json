    "word": "The Lord has been your Helper. He will be your Helper still. But you must remember the longing desire of your father. Remember the command that God has placed in the Decalogue: \"Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\" This is God's charge to you. Upon every child rests the responsibility of doing all in his power to minister to the happiness of his parents. Whoever seeks to lead you to disregard your father's wishes might better repent before God.",
