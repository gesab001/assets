From Glendale we went to San Diego, where we spent three weeks at the Paradise Valley Sanitarium. I think I have told you before about this property. It consists of a 50-room house and 30 acres of land, and cost the original owners $50,000. Three years ago it was offered to us for $15,000. We could not then see our way clear to purchase it, though we realized that it would be an excellent place for a sanitarium. The next year it was offered to us for $12,000. Still we delayed purchasing, and about a year ago we bought it for $5,500.",
