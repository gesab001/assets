Jones\n\n         Cautions About Making Doctrinal Differences Prominent; \n        Contemplating the Marvels and Mysteries of the Incarnation \n\n\n     (Written February 18, 1887, from Basel, Switzerland, to E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones.) \n\n\n     I have something to say to you that I should withhold no longer. I have been looking in vain as yet to get an article that was written nearly twenty years ago in reference to the \"added law.\" I read this to Elder [J. H.] Waggoner. I stated then to him that I had been shown [that] his position in regard to the law was incorrect, and from the statements I made to him he has been silent upon the subject for many years.",
