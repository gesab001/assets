    "word": "A wonderful blessing was represented to me as falling upon a congregation who were seeking the Lord with fasting and prayer. Their countenances were lighted up with the glory of God, and angels were passing from one to another, ministering to them. That is what we wish to see here in Mountain View. We wish to see it in the meetings that shall be held in Oakland and San Francisco. These cities are just as needy as are other mission fields. Many in them are as great sinners as can be found in any part of the world. If they are properly approached, many of them will be saved. They do not know what the Bible says, nor what it means.",
