White, Grimsby, England, September 19, 1886.] \n\n\n     [1 John 3:1-3, quoted.] \n\n\n     Here the beloved disciple is trying to present before us the great love of God to fallen man. He cannot find language broad enough and deep enough to express this wondrous love, and he calls upon the world to behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. How can we behold this love? By looking to the cross of Calvary. The light from the cross expresses the love God had for fallen man. John says, \"Behold, what manner of love.\" Behold the Man of Calvary; behold Him who is equal with the Father; behold the Majesty of heaven; behold the King of glory. God's own dearly-beloved Son--He gave Him a freewill offering for us, and here we see the wonderful condescension of the Father.",
