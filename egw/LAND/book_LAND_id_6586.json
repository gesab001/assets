Haskell Regarding Delay to Leave for Europe; Defense of Sister Harris\n\n     (Written January 14, 1887, from Bale, [THE FRENCH NAME FOR BASEL.] Switzerland, to S. N. Haskell.) \n\n\n     I have been meaning to write to you for some days, but have been very sick with malaria. I am now improving. It is three weeks since I first was taken sick. I have suffered much, and I feared much how it would turn with me, but I kept praying and putting my whole trust in God, and He has blessed me. I hope to improve now faster that I have done.",
