    "word": "MR No. 1448 - A Call to Service\n\n     (Diary entry June 22, 1901, written at Oakland, California.) \n\n     Today, Sabbath, I spoke to a large congregation in the tent, from the fourteenth chapter of John. I was led out to speak on faith in the promises of God, and I urged all to exercise faith and to express cheerfulness and gratitude. This is the last time I shall speak in the tent. I shall then have spoken eleven times. I think Brother A. T. Jones will speak tomorrow.",
