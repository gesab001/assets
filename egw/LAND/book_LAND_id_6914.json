    "word": "Apart from this, the sum of $1200.00 has been loaned me, which I have given my pledged word that I will repay when ever it is called for. I have used every dollar of this money in the work, so you see this takes more than my year's wages. You are aware that the entire amount of my last year's wages was donated to purchase land upon which to erect the school building. I have not a word to say in reference to the cutting off of two dollars per week from my wages; it will only cut off some opportunities where I should invest in the cause as I should discern its needs, thus limiting me on this end of the line. But I wish that you would carefully consider the cases of the workers, and see who are the men that are constantly obliged to use means in the interests of the work, and in starting the work in new fields, and who will not hold back for any selfish considerations. It is an encouragement that such men will not become selfish. W.C.W. will not, whatever the circumstances. But I know how it mortifies and galls him when his hands are bound, so that he does not feel at liberty to give.",
