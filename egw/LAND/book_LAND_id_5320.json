    "word": "Above everything else, be at peace among yourselves. Strive to see eye to eye and be members of the royal King and the blessing of God will rest upon you as it rested upon Solomon's Temple. And from this place may light and truth go out, and work upon the hearts of the people, and then your testimony will be felt. We must weave the principles of truth into our character and thus we can be prepared for the temple of God and be privileged to join in the anthem, Worthy is the Lamb.--Ms 49, 1886, pp. 1-6. (Sermon at the dedication of the church at Tramelan, Switzerland, Dec. 25, 1886.) \n\nReleased December, 1965.",
