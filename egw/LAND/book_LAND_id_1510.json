    "word": "Denmark has considerable moorland, from which a great quantity of peat is obtained. When burned, this produces much heat, and it is largely used by the \n179\ncountry people for fuel. The black turf is cut in square blocks like brick, and laid in long rows to dry in the sun; when dry, it is stacked, ready for market. About the homes of the people it was piled in neat stacks, rounded on the top, like beehives. This is one of God's merciful provisions for the poor. The laboring class are so poorly paid that without this it would be extremely difficult for them to obtain fuel.",
