    "word": "MR No. 1455 - Education of Youth and Women Needed; Moving Discreetly\n\n     (Written March 20, 1893, from Napier, New Zealand, to Brother and Sister Maxson.) \n\n\n     I have written to you twice, and other duties rushed in before I had completed the letters, and so the mail went without them. Now I am going to write to you first, and make sure you have that which I have written. Heretofore I received your letter with a little tract enclosed, but the same went to Melbourne and returned to me as I was on the boat en route for Auckland; on which boat I had a genuine seasick time, and Sister Starr was very sick, and Emily Campbell was sick the whole voyage. Willie was well, and he cared for us as much as he possibly could. I did not recover from the effects of this sickness for some time.",
