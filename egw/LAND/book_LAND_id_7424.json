    "word": "Often prayers are solicited for the believing souls in adversity and sickness. But those who are suffering reverses are represented by the bush, which, though burning, was not consumed. As Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro in the land of Midian, \"The angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush, and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.\" Moses draws near to see a strange thing. The fire in the bush does not consume the bush. He learns that the Lord is in the midst of the bush. So it is in life. It is not deprivation and affliction that is to be most dreaded; for the Lord is in it all, helping and sustaining. Our prayers need most to be offered for the men in high places. They need the prayers of the whole church, because they are entrusted with prosperity and influence.",
