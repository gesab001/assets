    "word": "Fathers and mothers, tell your children about the miracle-working power of God. Take them into the garden, and explain to them how he causes the seed sown to grow. As the children study the great lesson book of nature, God will impress their minds. The farmer plows his land and sows his seed, but he can not make the seed grow. He must depend upon God to do that which no human power can do. The Lord puts his own vital spirit into the seed, causing it to spring forth into life. Under his care the germ of life breaks through the hard crust encasing it, and springs up to bear fruit. First appears the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. As children are told of the work that God does for the seed, they learn the secret of growth in grace.",
