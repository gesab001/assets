    "word": "Many of the houses present a very ancient appearance, with their steep roofs and small-paned windows. Often  a considerable part of the house appears to be above the eaves. There may be only three or four stories below the \n176\neaves, while there are sometimes four or five above, with as many rows of odd little dormer-windows on the roof. Many of the houses in the small villages and in the outskirts of the towns serve the purpose both of barns and dwellings, the people living in one end of the building and the cattle in the other. Sometimes each end is occupied by a family, while the beasts have the center; these are usually kept in the stable by day as well as by night, for most of the land is too valuable to be used for pasturage.",
