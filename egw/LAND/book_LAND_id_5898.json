    "word": "Distance of Schools to Cities--The Lord has designated that distance from the cities affords the most favorable situation for our institutions. You ask if 25 miles is far enough from the city to establish a school. I think it is; and if nearer places can be found where there is good land for cultivation, let it be nearer. But if such places are not obtainable, let not the distance of a few miles be a hindrance to the establishment of the school.--Letter 156, 1906, pp. 2, 3. (To N. D. Faulkhead, May 29, 1906.) \n\n\n                                   -165-",
