Rand, Hamilton, Newcastle, New South Wales.) \n\n\n     I wish to express to you my satisfaction at your connection with the Hamilton Bath Business and the Retreat. There is a large and progressive work to be done in Newcastle and Maitland. I look upon this work as a growing work, and if it is not hindered by unChristlike, unwise movements it will do much good.",
