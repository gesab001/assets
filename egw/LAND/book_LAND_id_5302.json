    "word": "A few days ago Sister Hall, Sara, and I went for a long drive in Rock Creek Park. This is a most beautiful place. I have seldom driven over finer roads. This is the National Park. Here the President takes his rides. The drives are equal to, yes, more than equal to anything I saw in Denmark or Switzerland. On our drive we met the President. He bowed to us as we passed him.",
