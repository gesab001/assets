    "word": "WHAT HAS BEEN DONE.--A NUMBER OF CHURCH SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN STARTED DURING THE PRESENT SCHOOL YEAR, WITH VERY SATISFACTORY RESULTS. IT IS ALMOST THE UNIVERSAL OPINION IN THE CHURCHES WHERE THESE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN PLANTED THAT THEY \n\n\n                       -39- \n\nHAVE BEEN A GREAT HELP TO THE CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND PARENTS; ALSO, THAT THE CHURCHES HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED THROUGH THE INTEREST AROUSED AMONG OUTSIDE PEOPLE, A NUMBER OF WHOM HAVE SENT THEIR CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THE PROPER KIND OF EDUCATION, AND TO AVOID THE EVIL ASSOCIATIONS TO WHICH THEY MUST BE EXPOSED IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS. IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF NEARLY ALL CHURCH SCHOOL-TEACHERS THAT TEACHING IN THESE HUMBLE SCHOOLS IS THE MOST PRECIOUS MISSIONARY WORK THEY HAVE EVER DONE. MANY CHURCHES HAVE NOT STARTED SCHOOLS, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A TRUE MISSIONARY TEACHER. IF THE RIGHT KIND OF TEACHERS CAN BE PROCURED THERE WILL BE A LARGE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS STARTED NEXT FALL, AND, INSTEAD OF JUST A FEW PUPILS RECEIVING A CHRISTIAN EDUCATION IN SOME OF OUR COLLEGES AND ACADEMIES, THERE MAY BE HUNDREDS OF THEM ATTENDING OUR SCHOOLS, IF OUR PEOPLE WILL MOVE OUT BY FAITH AND DO WHAT THE LORD HAS TOLD THEM TO DO. WE TRUST THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL MOVE UPON THE HEARTS OF EARNEST YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO PREPARE THEMSELVES TO TEACH THE CHILDREN, NOT ONLY IN AMERICA, BUT IN FOREIGN LANDS AS WELL.",
