    "word": "A good work has been done in England. The work has necessarily moved slowly; more might have been done. But when we consider there is quite a little army of souls that have been added to the church, let us praise God. In Grimsby there are some precious souls. Some are not what they might be and yet their influence has done much for the cause of truth. I was made to rejoice while there that a young man teaching the school was under deep conviction and had commenced to keep the Sabbath, but his exercises came upon the Sabbath and he solicited the prayers of the brethren for wisdom how to manage this matter. He frankly confessed his faith and was favored. God was in this. I know of no more striking circumstance that has occurred in America showing evidence of genuine conversion.",
