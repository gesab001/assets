    "word": "\u201cTHE DAY BEFORE THEY REACHED TOPSHAM, HENRY CAME IN FROM HIS WORK IN THE AFTERNOON, AND THREW HIMSELF UPON THE SOFA, SAYING THAT HE NEVER HAD FELT SUCH A GLOOM RESTING UPON HIS MIND IN ALL HIS LIFE. HE SAID THAT IT WAS NOT ANYTHING HE HAD DONE WHICH CAUSED SUCH FEELINGS, BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. WHEN THE PARENTS ARRIVED, THE NEXT DAY, THEY FOUND THEIR THREE SONS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DEPOT. WHEN THE CARS STOPPED, HENRY BOUNDED THROUGH THE CROWD WITH MORE THAN USUAL ACTIVITY, AND EMBRACED HIS MOTHER MOST AFFECTIONATELY, WHILE IN HER HEART SHE THANKED GOD FOR SUCH A SON. THEY WENT DIRECTLY TO BROTHER HOWLAND'S HOUSE, AND WHEN THE SALUTATIONS WERE OVER, HENRY PLAYED AND SANG ONE OF HIS FAVORITE PIECES, \u2018HOME AGAIN,\u2019 SO APPROPRIATE FOR THE OCCASION.",
