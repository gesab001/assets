    "word": "Oh Lord, increase our faith, I was praying in the night season. I thought we were upon an island, and I saw a man who seemed much pleased, holding out a pocketbook to us, and saying, Help is coming. He was waiting for a boat. Then some person we could not quite discern in the long distance reached out his hand and took the pocketbook and put it in his inside coat pocket, and the hand which had held the pocketbook was stretched out to us empty. This dream caused me great disappointment, and I groaned aloud. I awoke and could sleep no more. This was about one o'clock in the morning.",
