    "word": "We have had storms and clouds most of the time since we have been here, and we long for the sunshine. The residents say that at this time of the year it is generally quite hot, and the grass begins to look gray. Now everything is in its glory. As we ride to and from the city, and pass the homes of the people, we see the orange trees covered with blossoms, the fragrance of which fills the air. Park lands extend around the city, and are to be found in different parts of the city. Yesterday we drove into a most beautiful park. In it were cultivated the pine, fir, and maple trees besides a variety of shrubs and other trees. The orange trees were there also, sending forth their fragrance nigh and afar off.",
