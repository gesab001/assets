    "word": "Wednesday, Sept. 17, 1873. We have some wind which draws down the canyon. We have to move our little stove several times in the day as the wind changes from one end of the tent to the other. . . . Travelers came by with wagon and men on foot driving sheep. They said there were thirteen hundred in the flock. They have taken up land in the Park and will spend the winter there and feed their sheep. Two other travelers passed.",
