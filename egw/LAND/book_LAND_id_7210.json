    "word": "Elder Simpson has been holding tent meetings in Los Angeles with good results. Many souls have been converted to the truth. We thank the Lord that we have a good sanitarium at Paradise Valley, seven miles from San Diego; a sanitarium at Glendale, eight miles from Los Angeles; and a large and beautiful place at Loma Linda, sixty-two miles east from Los Angeles, and close to Redlands, Riverside, and San Bernardino. The Loma Linda property is one of the most beautiful sanitarium sites I have ever seen. There has been expended on the place more than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and it was purchased by our people for forty thousand. Of the seventy-six acres of land comprised in the property, about one half forms a hill which stands one hundred and twenty-five feet above the valley. On this hill the buildings are situated. \n\n\n                                                    199.",
