I have learned that Brother Butler has thought of marrying Sister Keck's sister.  Some of the brethren, in talking with me about this matter, expressed their disapproval, saying that they thought that such a step would hurt Brother Butler's influence, especially should he marry so soon after his wife's death.  At the time I gave the subject scarcely a thought, but in the night season I was talking with one in regard to the matter, and the subject assumed a different aspect.",
