    "word": "I am charged with a message to all upon whom the light of truth has shone. They are to labor patiently and perseveringly for the thousands perishing in their sins, scattered in all lands like wrecks on a desert shore. All who share in Christ's glory must share in His ministry, helping the poor, the weak, the homeless. We must be intensely in earnest, using every capability in the Lord's service. Precious results will surely follow unselfish efforts. From the Great Teacher, the workers will receive the highest of all education.",
