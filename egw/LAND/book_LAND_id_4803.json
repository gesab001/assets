    "word": "I have been hoping that you would see the advantage of establishing the sanitarium on the school farm that has been purchased near Edgefield. The reason given me for saying that this would be an advantage, is that the school to be established there would be an encouragement and help to the sanitarium, and the sanitarium to the school. The matter has been presented to me this way several times, and I know that the sanitarium should not be permanently established in buildings in Nashville. If there could be found, four or five miles from the city, buildings which could be secured for a low price, and which could readily be adapted to sanitarium work, it might be well to secure them. [INASMUCH AS, ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF LATER, A PROPERTY SUITABLE FOR SANITARIUM WORK WAS FOUND WITHIN THIS DISTANCE OF THE CITY, THIS PASSAGE IS WORTHY OF CAREFUL NOTICE.] But such buildings have not yet been found, and as a large tract of land has been secured for school purposes, I can not see why there should be any hesitation in regard to establishing the sanitarium somewhere near the school.",
