    "word": "Those addressed in the message to the church in Sardis have heard and received the principles of truth. We are to be true to the evidences that God has given us in the representation of heavenly things. We are to hold fast the things that we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. The right path is plainly outlined before us. Those who misinterpret the precious things God has given me for His people, those who take the sentiments by which God so beautifully shows the difference between the earthly and the heavenly, removing these sentiments from the position in which God has placed them, and making them testify to seducing errors, are removing the landmarks. They cherish sentiments which they should resolutely have discarded. In an unmistakable, decided manner the reproof of God has come to them, forbidding them to spoil the people of God, forbidding them to teach sophistry for truth.",
