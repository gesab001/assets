    "word": "MR No. 780 - Work for the Cities of the East\n\n     Here we are, July 3. Our journey was rather trying from South Lancaster [Massachusetts] to Portland, Maine. The cars seemed inferior and there were some who for a time could not obtain seats. I had a seat with a stranger and the cars were crowded. We thought this a very uninteresting part of our journey.",
