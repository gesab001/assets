    "word": "We are informed in Scripture as to the number, and the power and glory, of the heavenly beings, of their connection with the government of God, and also of their relation to the work of redemption. \u201cThe Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.\u201d And, says the prophet, \u201cI heard the voice of many angels round about the throne.\u201d  In the presence-chamber of the King of kings they wait\u2014\u201cangels that excel in strength,\u201d \u201cministers of his, that do his pleasure,\u201d \u201chearkening unto the voice of his word.\u201d [Psalm 103:19-21; Revelation 5:11.] Ten thousand times ten thousand \n512\nand thousands of thousands, were the heavenly messengers beheld by the prophet Daniel. The apostle Paul declared them \u201can innumerable company.\u201d [Daniel 7:10; Hebrews 12:22.] As God's messengers they go forth, like \u201cthe appearance of a flash of lightning,\u201d [Ezekiel 1:14.] so dazzling their glory, and so swift their flight. The angel that appeared at the Saviour's tomb, his countenance \u201clike lightning, and his raiment white as snow,\u201d caused the keepers for fear of him to quake, and they \u201cbecame as dead men.\u201d [Matthew 28:3, 4.] When Sennacherib, the haughty Assyrian, reproached and blasphemed God, and threatened Israel with destruction, \u201cit came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand.\u201d There were \u201ccut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains,\u201d from the army of Sennacherib. \u201cSo he returned with shame of face to his own land.\u201d [2 Kings 19:35; 2 Chronicles 32:21.]",
