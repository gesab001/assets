    "word": "There may be instrumentalities which we do not prefer because they do not exactly meet our ideas. They do not work in the very line we have marked, and in the place of leaving them with God we begin to lay difficulties and barricades in the way and cherish a grieved feeling because we see that they are doing a work which we ourselves cannot do. Then comes the picking, the dissecting of character, the talking, the gathering up of tidbits of complaint, and faultfinding and slander magnifies little occurrences and events into grave sins. This has been done with the church at Lemoore until you are a weak church, and you always will be weak until this narrow order of things is changed. May the Lord show you all what to do that you may be filled with thanksgiving, gratitude, and praise to God for the precious gift of the Son of God, and not with envying, jealousies, and rivalries. Then true love and unity will exist.",
