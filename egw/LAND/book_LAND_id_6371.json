    "word": "MR No. 1463 - The Need for Christ's Spirit in Our College; Teachers to Reflect Christ\n\n        (Read to General Conference delegates in Battle Creek, December, 1881.) \n\n\n     We have many fears that our college is fast degenerating. It stands today in a position that God does not approve. I was shown that this would be the danger that would threaten it, and if the responsible men in the college should seek to reach the world's standard, or to mold it after the fashion of the colleges of our land, the woe of God would be upon it.",
