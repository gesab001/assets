    "word": "Brother Fulton, a man who loves and fears God, requested an interview with me during our conference in Oakland, and then stated that the burden was upon him day and night to connect with the Health Retreat at St. Helena. This looked like the work of the Lord, and we set this matter before the board, and he was given a place there with his pleasant, good wife. This is what we needed, a man and his wife. This would close the door to scandal, and these two, united, we knew would place a different mold upon the institution.",
