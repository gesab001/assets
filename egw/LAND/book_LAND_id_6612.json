My garden was made in the low land, and twice it has been overflowed. Now we hope there will be a spell of dry weather so that we can work the land. We have had one week of most beautiful weather. Bear in mind that it is our winter now. I can scarcely write, the paper is so cold to my hands. I have not kindled a fire in my stove for one week, for a fire is only necessary in the few early morning hours. I am so thankful that we have so healthful a climate. When you come to Australia, I will build you a home of your own if the Lord prospers me. I think we have far more sunshine and fine weather here than in any country I have ever visited. All who come here improve in health. It is a very unusual thing to have foggy or cloudy weather.",
