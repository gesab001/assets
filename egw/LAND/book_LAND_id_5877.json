    "word": "Landscape and Travel in the Mountains of Colorado, 1872--We have been slowly climbing the ascent with two engines drawing the train. We are upon the summit. One engine has been run off. We are now descending. We are eight thousand feet above the level of the sea. We are one hundred and thirty-some miles from Denver. The scenery is not charming. No farms or cultivated lands from Denver to Cheyenne. It was plains with nothing to relieve the monotony but large herds of cattle, two thousand or more in a herd.",
