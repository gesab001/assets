    "word": "The Israelites as a nation still continued in a state of irreligion and idolatry, and as a punishment they remained in subjection to the Philistines.

After suffering the oppression of their enemies for twenty years, the Israelites \"mourned after the Lord.\" Samuel counseled them, \"If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only\" (1 Samuel 7:3).",
