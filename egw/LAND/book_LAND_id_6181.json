    "word": "How we shall find things when we arrive at Oakland, we cannot say. May the Lord make my duty plain. I believe He will, for I have not had a will of my own but I have inquired most earnestly to know the will of God, and then without murmuring have followed in the path of duty, often contrary to my wishes and inclination. Light will shine. I shall see my way clearly. I shall know the will of God.",
