    "word": "There is a great diversity in the railway carriages on the roads in Switzerland, Germany, and Scandinavia. On some roads they are divided, like those in England, into small compartments between which there is no communication; on other roads, especially in Switzerland, they are more like our American coaches, where they are entered at the end. The first-class compartments are elegantly furnished. The second-class compartments, which often occupy part of the same car with the first-class, are usually clean and comfortably furnished, and when not overcrowded are more comfortable than our American day-coaches. Many of the second-class cars are divided into two compartments, two-thirds of the room being devoted to the smokers, and one-third to those \n175\nwho do not smoke. The third-class cars are often closely seated with narrow, hard seats. On some roads, fourth-class cars without seats are run for the accommodation of the very poorest classes. Most of the express trains run first, second, and third class coaches, and so different are the patterns that it is not uncommon to see a long train with no two cars alike.",
