    "word": "Chap. XLVII - In Confirmation of Confidence\n\n     During the summer of 1890, Mrs. White devoted much of her time to writing. In October she was urged to attend general meetings in Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, and Maryland. After a few days spent in Adams Center, N. Y., she attended a general meeting at South Lancaster, Mass. On the journey from South Lancaster to Salamanca, N. Y., she caught a severe cold, and found herself at the beginning of the Salamanca meeting much wearied as the result of the ten days of arduous labor at South Lancaster, and heavily burdened with hoarseness and a sore throat.",
