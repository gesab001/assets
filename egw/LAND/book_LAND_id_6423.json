    "word": "MR No. 1485 - School to Start Small; Have Faith; Do Not Overwork\n\n     (Written December 7, 1901, from South Lancaster, Massachusetts, to P. T. Magan.) \n\n\n     Your letter from Chicago received yesterday. I am very sorry that circumstances have taken the shape that they have, but why are you so faithless? Thank the Lord that you have few students, because you are not prepared for a large number. Brother Sutherland and yourself have done bravely and well, and why will you worry yourself out of the arms of your precious Saviour? Has the bank of heaven failed? Have you overdrawn the resources? Is Christ, the Light of the world, in Joseph's new tomb? Do we not read, \"Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them\" (Hebrews 7:25)? Now look away from every discouraging presentation, because we have a living Christ, to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him.",
