    "word": "We feel better today. It is a most beautiful morning. We shall be in Cheyenne tonight at five o'clock. We shall not reach Omaha until Monday night or Tuesday morning and will have to wait over twelve hours there, be attached to express train for Chicago. We have very scrimped time. Shall shift off if we see we shall be too late for appointment at Alma. We can but just make it at the best. We feel the need of that Sunday we spent in Oakland ever so much. We shall want to hear from you all. I have not written anything. I dread even the exertion of writing letters. We want to hear from you as soon as possible, for I worry about Willie.--Letter 38, 1880, pp. 1, 2. (To W. C. and Mary White.)",
