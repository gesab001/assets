    "word": "Christ is our example. Do you imitate the great Exemplar? Christ often wept but never was known to laugh. I do not say it is a sin to laugh on any occasion, but we cannot go astray if we imitate the divine, unerring Pattern. We are living in a sad age of this world's history. Violence is in the land, corruption is on every hand, the inhabitants of the earth are fast filling up the measure of the cup of their iniquity. Everywhere we go we see men and women controlled by Satan, captives to do his will. They are blinded and know not that their destruction is near. When the deception shall be removed, they will find how much is meant in being without God and hope in the world. A day of destruction and anguish removes the security which enclosed them, and then fierce anguish comes upon them. Probation is ended and they must remain filthy forever.",
