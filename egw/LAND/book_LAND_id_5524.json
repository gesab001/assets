    "word": "MR No. 409 - The Work in New Zealand\n\n     There is a work to be done in New Zealand that has not yet been done. The impress of human imperfections has bound about the work. But the Lord's eye is upon His people in New Zealand. He wishes them to reach a higher standard. He desires them to overcome all self-exaltation. No envy or jealousy is to be manifested, no evil surmisings entertained. We are laborers together with God. One laborer plants, another waters or cultivates, and God gives the increase. The progress of the work in each individual soul determines the strength of the church. The church advances as God gives the increase.",
