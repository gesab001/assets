    "word": "I have been writing to Rebekah Winslow and Frances Howland. They were among our best friends. They took care of Henry when he was a little child, and our family and their family were one. This is the first letter I have addressed to them for 20 years. Recently they sent me a very handsome shawl, and I thought I would acknowledge the receipt of it and send them a letter. I ought to have written them long ago.",
