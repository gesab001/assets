    "word": "You will be glad to know that we have obtained an ample supply of water for the Paradise Valley Sanitarium. The scarcity of water was the one thing against the place. Some time ago workmen began digging a well on the lower part of the sanitarium land. They went down 80 feet, and one evening Brother Palmer came to my room to tell me that a stream of water as large as his hand was running into the well. The next morning early he and Willie \n\n\n                                 -249- \n\ncame to my room to tell me that there was 14 feet of water in the well. The water is soft and pure. This well is a treasure more valuable than gold or silver or precious stones.",
