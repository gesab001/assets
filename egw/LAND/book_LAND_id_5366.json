    "word": "The cities of the South have been long neglected. Light that has been given me in the past has been repeated, concerning the work to be done in New Orleans, in Memphis, and other cities. Yet how little has been done. I encouraged Brother Washburn to feel that if the call came for him to engage in ministerial work for these needy cities, he should regard it as the call of the Lord to him. Brother Staines has purchased land near to Nashville, \n\n\n                                    -31- \n\nwhere he is erecting a school for the colored people. This will answer the present needs until the way is made more plain. It would not be wise to start too many enterprises at one time, and then find ourselves unable to carry them successfully. The Huntsville school must be finished, and students from that place fitted to take hold of the work of educating their own people.--Letter 317, 1907, pp. 1, 2. (To the Nashville church, September 24, 1907.)",
