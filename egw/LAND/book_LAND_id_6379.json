    "word": "In our meeting at Hamilton, held the week before, the power of God was present, and we have every reason to thank and praise our heavenly Father. The labors of our ministering brethren were of a character to establish and settle and uplift the believers. Some were there from Maitland who were keeping their first Sabbath. In the Sabbath afternoon meeting, many excellent testimonies were borne. Some souls were in trial through the manifold temptations of the enemy, but the Lord gave them His blessing, and their feet were established upon the only sure foundation--the word of the Lord.",
