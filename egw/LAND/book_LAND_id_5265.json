    "word": "Thursday we were promised a horse and cart, and rode over the hills to call on some of our people. We found then that it was some miles they had to walk--fathers and mothers and children--to the meetings. Most preferred to walk rather than to drive their horses up and down the steep hills. We found cultivated lands surrounded with \"bush,\" as they called them. We should call them small cottages and a few acres of cleared land in the woods. The trees, which were very small, were loaded with nice apples. I have seldom seen such small trees bearing. Most of the people seemed comfortably situated, but poor in this world's goods. \n\n\n                                     -263-",
