    "word": "The condition of the world under the Romish power presented a fearful and striking fulfillment of the words of the prophet Hosea: \u201cMy people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee; . . . seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.\u201d \u201cThere is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.\u201d [Hosea 4:6, 1, 2.] Such were the results of banishing the Word of God.",
