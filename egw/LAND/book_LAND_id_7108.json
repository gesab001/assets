    "word": "Recently the question arose about securing more of the nearby land that is for sale. One piece, a tract of 86 acres, has already been purchased, and there is another of 47 acres joining the Loma Linda property, which is now offered for sale. Because this piece of land is so near to our Loma Linda buildings, we do not want to see it sold to outsiders, who will divide it up, and sell it to those who may desire to crowd into this neighborhood. In the night season I was talking to our brethren, telling them that this must not be allowed, and pointing out what unfavorable results would follow. If this \n\n\n                              -580- \n\npiece of land should be purchased by outsiders, and divided up and sold to those who would be no help to our work, the injury to Loma Linda would be serious and lasting. I cannot bear the thought of this. Cannot a group of individuals who are alive to the vital interests of the Lord's work, unite together and make this land our property? Then if we wish to sell any portion of it, let it be sold to our people. There is an orange orchard on the place, and this could be handled to advantage by the sanitarium. The institution is hardly complete (958) without the control of this orange orchard.",
