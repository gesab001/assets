    "word": "First Visit to Scandinavia \n\n     During the two years spent by Mrs. White in Europe, she visited Denmark, Sweden, and Norway three times. At the close of the Missionary Council held in Basel during September, 1885, the delegates from Scandinavia pleaded that she should visit their field as soon as possible; and although her friends in Switzerland pointed out that summer was a better time to travel in northern Europe, she decided to venture out by faith, trusting in God for strength to endure the hardships of the journey.",
