    "word": "Heathen nations had reproached the Lord and His people because the Hebrews had not possessed the land of Canaan, which they expected to inherit soon after leaving Egypt. Their enemies had triumphed because they had so long wandered in the wilderness, and they proudly lifted themselves up against God, declaring that He was not able to lead them into the\n178\nland of Canaan. They had now passed over Jordan on dry land, and their enemies could no longer reproach them.",
