    "word": "Since we returned from Australia, the Lord has opened the way for the establishment of the sanitarium work in southern California. The brethren there have found opportunity to buy several properties at a price very much below the original cost. The first of these was an opportunity to purchase the Fernando school buildings. These buildings were in every way adapted for school work, and I advised their purchase. The property consists of a large school building, a dwelling house, twelve-and-a-half acres of land partly set out to orange trees; and the price paid was eleven thousand dollars. I asked how this price compared with the real value of the property, and the answer was that we had obtained the property for about one-third of its value.",
