    "word": "A Famine for the Word \n\n     Those who do not now appreciate, study, and dearly prize the Word of God spoken by His servants will have cause to mourn bitterly hereafter. I saw that the Lord in judgment will at the close of time walk through the earth; the fearful plagues will begin to fall. Then those who have despised God's Word, those who have lightly esteemed it, shall \"wander from sea \n                                                                           235\nto sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the Word of the Lord and shall not find it\" (Amos 8:12). A famine is in the land for hearing the Word.--Ms 1, 1857.",
