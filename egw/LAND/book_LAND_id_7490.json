    "word": "A good work was done by Brethren Magan and Sutherland at Berrien Springs, and in their labors in that place they labored beyond their strength, imperilling their health, and even their lives. In their work at Madison, they are working too hard, \n\n\n                             -401- \n\nand amid many difficulties. These brethren need not only our confidence, but also our help, that they may place the Madison School where it can accomplish the work that God designs it to do. I pray that the Lord will sanctify the understanding of our people that these men will not be left to so work as to sacrifice their health in what they are trying to do. I pray that teachers and students may have wisdom and courage to act well their part, and that they may be especially blessed in making the school a success.",
