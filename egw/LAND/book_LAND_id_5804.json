    "word": "The place that we have just purchased here in California for our school contains wonderful advantages. It is situated on Howell Mountain, five miles from the Sanitarium. There are over 1600 acres of land in the property, 105 of which is good arable land. There are twenty acres of orchard, bearing apples, pears, plums, prunes, peaches, figs, grapes, and English and black walnuts. There are thirty acres of alfalfa. Forty-five tons of prunes have been gathered from the orchard this year, and 2000 quarts of canned fruit were in the cellar when the place was purchased.",
