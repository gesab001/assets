    "word": "I would say to our brethren in the Southern field, Let there be no restrictions laid on the Madison School to limit its work in the field of its operation. If Brethren Sutherland and Magan have promised not to draw students to their school from the Southern states, they should be freed from any such restrictions. Such a promise should never have been asked nor granted. I am instructed to say that there should be no restrictions limiting their freedom to draw students from the Southern field. There is need of such an institution as has been established near Nashville, and let no one endeavor to hinder the attendance of those who can at that school best receive the training that will fit them to labor in the Southern states, and in other mission fields.",
