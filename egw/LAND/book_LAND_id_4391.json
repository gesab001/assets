    "word": "Do all things without murmurings and disputings, without grumbling, without envy. Do not repeat or believe the old slander that the man of one talent brought against God, \"I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layest not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow\" (Luke 19:21). This parable represented the many professors of religion who gauged their piety to reach the lowest standard possible, and escape perdition.",
