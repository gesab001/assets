    "word": "Brother and Sister Howland and Brother and Sister Foy are sleeping in Jesus. They died true to the faith. Brother Howland's daughters are still living. John, a son of Brother and Sister Foy, has for years been connected with the Battle Creek Sanitarium as gardener. A few weeks ago I learned, to my surprise, that the other son, Stephen, is at the Veterans' Home in Yountville. I last saw him--then a lad of seven years--in Brunswick, Maine. Yesterday we renewed our acquaintance. He is now 50 years old. It was a most interesting meeting to us both.",
