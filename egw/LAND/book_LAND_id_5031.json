    "word": "When the children of Israel were on their journey through the wilderness, the Lord protected them from the venomous serpents; but there came a time when, because of Israel's stubbornness and impenitence and transgression, the Lord removed his restraining power from these reptiles whose sting was deadly, and many were bitten and died. Then it was that the brazen serpent was uplifted, that all who repented and looked to it in faith might live. In the time of confusion and trouble, such as never was since there was a nation, the uplifted Saviour will be presented to the people in all lands and in all places, that all who look may live.",
