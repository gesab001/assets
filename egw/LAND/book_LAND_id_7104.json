Burden. \n     . . . . \n\n\n     I wish to say to Elder Burden that the money which I pledged to help purchase the eighty-five acres will be sent without fail. Please let me know if a couple of weeks' delay will trouble you seriously. I am truly glad that I gave my promise to help to purchase this land, under the influence of the Spirit of God. I felt that the land must be secured; otherwise that we should have reason to regret that we did not obtain it. \n\n                                               -",
