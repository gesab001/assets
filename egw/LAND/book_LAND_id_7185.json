    "word": "Basle, Switzerland, February 18, 1887 \nDear Brethren Waggoner and A. T. Jones: \n\n\n     I have some things to say to you that I should withhold no longer. I have been looking in vain as yet to get an article that was written nearly twenty years ago in reference to the added law. I read this to Elder Waggoner; I stated then to him that I had been shown his position in regard to the law was incorrect, and from the statements I made to him he has been silent upon the subject for many years.",
