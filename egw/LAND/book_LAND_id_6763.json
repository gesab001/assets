    "word": "Is not this remarkable? Has not the Lord blessed? From one of the reports received, we learn that last \n\n\n                 -254- \n\nyear 7000 pounds of honey of the best quality had been made on the school estate. Large quantities of vegetables have been raised, and the sale of the surplus has been a source of considerable revenue to the school.
