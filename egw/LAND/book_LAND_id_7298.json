Mrs. White toured the Southern sites to see the progress of the work and provide encouragement. She gives Marian Davis a rather thorough account of the status of affairs efforts at Graysville, Huntsville and Nashville. Ellen White treats on the Oakwood situation extensively in this letter, perhaps her most lengthy account of the particulars of the school. Her insights are keen and accurate.\nJune 30, 1904\n     Early on Monday morning we took the train for Huntsville. We reached the school at one o\u2019clock the same day. That afternoon we were taken over a portion of the school farm. We find that there are nearly 400 acres of land, a large part of which is under cultivation. Several years ago Brother S. M. Jacobs was in charge of the farm, and under his care it made great improvement. He set out a peach and plum orchard, and other fruit trees. Brother and Sister Jacobs left Huntsville about three years ago, and since then the farm has not been so well cared for. We see in the land promise of a much larger return than it now gives, were its managers given the help they need.",
