    "word": "The Lord God is the strength of His people, and as you are, in the providence of God, situated on one of the islands of the sea [Norfolk Island], if you make God your dependence and your trust, you will be a great blessing to diffuse light. The endowment of grace you need daily, in order to walk circumspectly. Seek to cultivate the traits of character that will win souls to Jesus. We cannot for a moment entertain the idea that we have any sufficiency of ourselves, but we can through faith and cultivation of every trait of character, striving not for the supremacy but to be more Christlike, grow up into Christ our living head, and become complete in Him.",
