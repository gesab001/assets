    "word": "Brother B lives at Kellyville. He has been a real-estate agent, earning from twenty to forty pounds sterling a month. When the tent was pitched \n\n\n                                       -94- \n\nat Kellyville, he, with his wife and older children, embraced the truth. This is a most precious family, intelligent and devoted. They had purchased and cleared twenty acres of land, which cost them thirty pounds sterling an acre, and set it out to fruit trees. It was entirely paid for, and, expecting to be as prosperous as he had been, Brother B built himself a nice cottage and had it expensively furnished. But the financial crisis came, and he with hundreds of others was thrown out of employment, for men had no money to purchase land and dwelling houses.--Letter 50, 1894, pp. 1-4. (To Harmon Lindsay, June 14, 1894.)",
