    "word": "We have had the light of health reform, and the Lord requires us to live that light. God will not daily work a miracle to counteract the unhealthful, selfish doings of man. Man is required to care for his health building, which the Lord has given him. He must not eat unwisely, and then ask the Lord to give him health. He must not contract habits which will have a tendency to debilitate and enfeeble his presence. Our ministers must become increasingly intelligent in regard to their bodies and how to treat them. The minister is to set an example to the people and the world, to reveal that he has sound judgment, that he is sober-minded. The charge of the apostle is: \"Young men likewise to be sober minded. In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you\" [Titus 2:6-8]. --Ms 104, 1898. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nNovember 16, 1989. Entire Ms.",
