    "word": "SDA Schools and Degrees--In view of all this, our schools should have little to say now of \"degrees,\" and of long courses of study. The work of preparation for the service of God is to be done speedily. Let the work be carried forward in strictly Bible lines. Let every soul remember that the judgments of God are in the land. Let \"degrees\" be little spoken of.--Letter 382, 1908, p. 4. (To G. A. Irwin, Dec. 23, 1908.)",
