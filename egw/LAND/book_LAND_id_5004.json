    "word": "The Southern Highlanders \n\n     A work that God approves has been done in the South. God has wrought with the workers. But there is much more to be done. Every movement made in this field must be made intelligently. There are men who can do acceptable service in the South. But it is impossible for those who have not visited this field, who have not gained an experience in working for those in the South, to understand what this work demands. The work will not be done by those who wait for all difficulties to be removed. . . .",
