    "word": "We purchased this building, with 20 acres of land, for $5,000. Since then eight acres of land have been bought for $800. There is a piece of property adjoining, consisting of ten acres of orange orchard, a packing house, a dwelling house, and a large barn. This property was offered for $3,500, and we may buy it if it can still be secured for this price. In order to do this, I should have to borrow money, but I do not think that the property ought to be allowed to pass into the hands of worldlings.",
