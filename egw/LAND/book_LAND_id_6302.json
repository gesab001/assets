    "word": "I must confess that I have little confidence in Dr. Maxson's remaining contented long at the Health Retreat. He loves to be making money. He has tried it and considers it a grand success, and should he for some excuse step out, who would go in his place? I think Dr. Gibbs should be, in some way, connected with the institution. This might be arranged in such a way so that he could spend some time in Healdsburg, Oakland, and some surrounding towns; and if Dr. Maxson and Hattie should step out, which I fear they will, then you would have Dr. Gibbs. I know of no one I would rather trust than Dr. Gibbs, if he has a faithful superintendent.",
