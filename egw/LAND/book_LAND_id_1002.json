    "word": "Our educational institutions are to do much toward meeting the demands for trained workers for the mission fields. Workers are needed all over the world. The truth of God is to be carried to foreign lands, that those who are in darkness may be enlightened. Cultivated talents are needed in every part of the work of God. God has designed that our schools shall be an instrumentality for developing workers for Him, --workers of whom He will not be ashamed. He calls upon our young people to enter our schools, and quickly fit themselves for service.--Review and Herald, August 22, 1912.",
