    "word": "Before my husband's death this matter in regard to the publishing house at Battle Creek and the publishing house at Oakland was presented to me under the figure of the vine, and since that time it has been presented to me under the same figure. The Lord has shown me that these two institutions are to be kept as separate as two branches which, though distinct, both center in the parent vine. They are not to be merged into one, but are to be kept distinct, yet each is to derive its nourishment from the same source. Said Christ, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.\" \"I am the true vine, ye are the branches.\" Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\" \"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye except ye abide in me.\" \"He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.\" \"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.\" \"And now also the axe is laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire..\" \"Ye shall \n                                                                           1518\nknow them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles. Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.\" \"Herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit, so shall ye be my disciples.",
