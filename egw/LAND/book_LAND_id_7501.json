    "word": "In their work at Madison Brethren Sutherland and Magan and their associates have borne trial nobly. They have taught the students to raise their own crops, to build their own houses, and to care wisely for cattle and poultry. The students have been learning to become self-supporting, and a more important training than that they could not receive. Thus they have obtained a valuable education for useful labor in missionary fields.",
