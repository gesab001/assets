    "word": "I wish to call your attention to one point. We receive no outside donations. Our churches here are not favored as in America with donations from outside parties. If there are men and women in America who donate to the Orphans' Home and the Old People's Home, we thank the Lord for this. Let thanksgiving ascend to God that He has inclined the hearts of men and women who are able to give of their means for these institutions. These buildings stand, making their calls, and will draw money, when not one dollar would be given to advance religious interests. The demand made constantly upon the treasury is keeping it empty. I see no help for us in this field; for if those in America are solicited to help personally, they will say, \"Oh, there are home interests which demand all our money. Australia and New Zealand are so far off. We see plenty of places where we can devote our means nearer home.\" These words have been literally spoken. \n                                                                           1154",
