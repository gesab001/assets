    "word": "Those who encourage this close application to books, working the brain, and neglecting the education they should gain by using the muscles \n\n\n                                    -111- \n\nproportionately with the brain, are simply incapable of retaining the lessons they endeavor to learn. If one third of the time now occupied in the study of books, using the mental machinery, were occupied in learning lessons in regard to the right use of one's own physical powers, it would be much more after the Lord's order, and would elevate the labor question, placing it where idleness would be regarded as a departure from the Word and plans of God. The right use of one's self includes the whole circle of human obligations to one's self, to the world, and to God. Then use the physical power proportionately with the mental power.--Letter 103, 1897, p. 1. (To E. A. Sutherland, July 23, 1897.) \n\nReleased September 26, 1977.",
