    "word": "One thing, I am thinking, you are crowding families all together too near the school. I advise that a large space of land be reserved without settling families so near the school. We see the folly of this. Let them locate at some distance from the immediate school lands. When families come in that can render moral strength to the workers in the school, then you have accomplished a good job, but from the light given me there will be, as there is now, those who shall settle on the land who will be thorns in our sides.-- Letter 167, 1897, pp. 6, 7. (To W. C. White, January 14, 1897.) \n\n\n                                    -257-",
