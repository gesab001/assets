    "word": "The work of our missions in foreign lands must be extended; and if the converting power of God shall come to our youth, we shall see them pressing into the ranks of the workers. Greater effort should be made to afford them facilities to prepare for labor in these foreign fields. A fund should be raised to be devoted to assisting those to prepare for the work who will give themselves unreservedly to God and his cause, and who will labor, not for large wages, but for the love of Christ, to save souls for whom he died. In every mission established there should be a school for the training of laborers. The very best talent among the Germans, the French, and the Scandinavians should be enlisted in the education of promising young men and women of the different nationalities. And in all our educational institutions special facilities should be provided for the instruction and training of those who want to become missionaries among their own people in foreign lands.",
