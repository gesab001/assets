    "word": "MR No. 1126 - Thoughts While Traveling on a Train\n\n (Written May 24, 1876, near Laramie Plains, Wyoming, to \"Dear Children.\") \n\n\n     We rested well last night. Our quarters are not nearly as good as in the stateroom when we left Oakland. But we are making the best of the situation and therefore are quite comfortable. Our comfortable condition is made by the tone of our feelings within. None can but be happy if they take the happy with them. If we are connected with heaven, the content and peace and happiness of heaven will be ours. Our slights, our neglects, our sorrows and griefs, will not, cannot, depress the heart that is borrowing its strength and serenity from heaven.",
