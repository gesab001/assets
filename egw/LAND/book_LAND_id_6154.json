    "word": "September 20. I had a private interview with Brother [A. A.] John in regard to his manner of labor in holding open-air meetings. He now thinks that he had better connect with Elder R. F. Andrews in Ireland. Sister Ribton has written to him an urgent letter for labor where she is. I had talked with Brother Whitney in regard to Brother and Sister Mallon uniting their talent with the publishing house in Basle. It is thought best to carry this through. May the Lord help in working up this matter.",
