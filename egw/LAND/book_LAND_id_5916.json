    "word": "While affording the benefits of country life, our sanitarium will be sufficiently near Sydney to secure the advantages of connection with the city. There are two railway lines leading into Sydney. The stations are about twenty minutes' drive from the sanitarium farm, and trains run almost hourly into the city. Five or six little villages within a few miles of our site are fast filling up with the residences of businessmen from the city. This district seems destined to be the most desirable of all the suburbs of Sydney. Not a person who has seen our location of land has one word of criticism to offer. All are surprised that we have purchased it so cheaply. We are sure that it possesses advantages above any other place we have seen.",
