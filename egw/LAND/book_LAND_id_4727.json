Dear Brother,-- \n     I write to ask you to interest yourself in the school at Madison. Brethren Sutherland and Magan have worked diligently, far beyond their strength, to open up the school work in this place, which is of the Lord's appointment. They have endeavored to establish a school that would fit young men and young women to act as missionaries in the Southern field.",
