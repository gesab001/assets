Daniels (1890)\n\n\n                        Basel, Switzerland, August 6, 1886. \n\n     Dear Brother and Sister Daniels: Again my mind is much exercised in regard to you. I dreamed that I was in your home sitting at your table, but I could not see that the teachings that you have given others on self-denial and health reform were carried out. I groaned in spirit, and said, \"Brother Daniels, you are going into darkness.\" The Lord has shown me that you have such traits of character that, should you be prospered financially, you would be in danger of losing your soul. You would not be economical; you would use your means too freely; your wants would increase, and you would not practice self-denial. I was shown that the Lord in mercy has kept you in the school of poverty that he might save your soul.",
