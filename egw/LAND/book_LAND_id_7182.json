    "word": "The Lord is giving me strength for my labors in Southern California. I am trusting Him for strength to speak to our people in Redlands and Riverside and San Bernardino. Never have I felt more deeply the necessity of keeping the way of the Lord, and of doing His will at all times. Wherever I speak to our people, I tell them that now is the time to do a thorough work for eternity. We must be humble, yet trustful. We must make use of every talent the Lord gives us.",
