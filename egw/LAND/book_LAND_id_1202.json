    "word": "Said Miller, in describing that work: \u201cThere is no great \n401\nexpression of joy; that is, as it were, suppressed for a future occasion, when all Heaven and earth will rejoice together with joy unspeakable and full of glory. There is no shouting; that, too, is reserved for the shout from Heaven.  The singers are silent; they are waiting to join the angelic hosts, the choir from Heaven.\u201d \u201cThere is no clashing of sentiments; all are of one heart and of one mind.\u201d Another who participated in the movement testified: \u201cIt has produced everywhere the most deep searching of heart and humiliation of soul. . . . It caused a weaning of affections from the things of this world, a healing of controversies and animosities, a confession of wrongs, a breaking down before God, and penitent, broken-hearted supplications to him for pardon and acceptance. It caused self-abasement and prostration of soul, such as we never before witnessed. As the Lord commanded by the prophet Joel, when the great day of God should be at hand, it produced a rending of hearts and not of garments, and a turning unto the Lord with fasting, and weeping, and mourning. As God said by Zechariah, a spirit of grace and of supplication was poured out upon his children; they looked to Him whom they had pierced, there was great mourning in the land, . . . and those who were looking for the Lord afflicted their souls before him.\u201d",
