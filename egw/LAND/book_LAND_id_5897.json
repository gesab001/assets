    "word": "Do Not Sell School Land; Raise Crops on It--Instruction was given me that a mistake was being made in selling so much of the school land. The land should have been kept by the school, to be utilized in raising crops that would have done much to sustain the school. I have said that if some of the land that was sold could be purchased back, it would be well.--Letter 61, 1905, p. 1. (To A. J. Breed, Feb. 5, 1905.)",
