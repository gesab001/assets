Let him fix in his memory the promise, \u201cThe angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.\u201d Psalm 34:7. Let him read that wonderful story of Elisha in the mountain city, and, between him and the hosts of armed foemen, a mighty encircling band of heavenly angels. Let him read how to Peter, in prison and condemned to death, God\u2019s angel appeared; how, past the armed guards, the massive doors and great iron gateway with their bolts and bars, the angel led God\u2019s servant forth in safety. Let him read of that scene on the sea, when the tempest-tossed soldiers and seamen, worn with labor and watching and long fasting, Paul the prisoner, on his way to trial and execution, spoke those grand words of courage and hope: \u201cBe of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man\u2019s life among you. . . . For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.\u201d In the faith of this promise Paul assured his companions, \u201cThere shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.\u201d So it came to pass. Because there was in that ship one man through whom God could work, the whole shipload \n317\nof heathen soldiers and sailors was preserved. \u201cThey escaped all safe to land.\u201d Acts 27:22-24, 34, 44.",
