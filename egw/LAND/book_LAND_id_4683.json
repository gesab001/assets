    "word": "To all who obey him the Lord will say, \"Dwell with me as my servants.\" \"He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. . . . Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off, him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.\"",
