    "word": "When we go out to visit in the country, we have no opportunity to send them word beforehand, so we carry our provisions with us, place an abundance of simple food on the table, and eat with the family. This privilege we highly value, because it gives us an opportunity to see the family together, and have conversation with them, but we could not enjoy it that day, for we spent most of our precious time on the road. When we reached the first place, Brother L's, the family had taken their noonday meal. We had a conversation with them, and were convinced that they were letting go their hold upon the truth because of discouragements. Just before Brother L received the truth, he purchased a place in the country, at Castle Hill. The locality is very beautiful. The land boom was then sweeping over New South Wales, and he paid twenty-five pounds sterling per acre for ten acres of land. He has planted orchards of orange and other fruit trees, and has cleared and cultivated the land. Then he built a good-sized, two-story house. His brother, who is an unbeliever, pledged himself to help him out, but a few months ago the bank panic struck through this section, and the bank in which his brother had all his money closed. It has not failed, but the brother cannot get his money out. The same bank holds the obligation of Brother L, and they may come down on him any day and take his all, because he cannot raise five hundred pounds for the necessary payment. This brother sees no way out. He has a wife and five children. He feels that he is under the shadow. \n\n\n                                   -79-",
