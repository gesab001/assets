    "word": "We have just passed a mud village, houses made of mud smoothed so nicely they really looked nice, so nice. We thought them now in process of building, but we learned it was an old settlement left to decay. The village was moved to another section of this barren waste country. We have now passed a village of houses composed of mud, wood, and cloth. Many roofs are covered with cloth and mud placed on the top of cloth. No trees are to be seen anywhere, no cultivated lands. In these villages the railroad men reside. Nothing can be raised here.--Letter 26, 1872, pp. 1-2. (To Edson and Emma White, Sept. 23, 1872.)",
