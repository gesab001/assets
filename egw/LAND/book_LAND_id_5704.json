    "word": "MR No. 691 - Ellen White's Regard for the Poor\n\n     Now we must secure for this family a spot of land, and put them in a way to get a little house on the land. This is missionary soil. Brother A is one of the most conscientious, self-denying, self-sacrificing, uncomplaining men I have ever seen. He is just such a man as will do credit to the truth. We should keep the land reserved for such ones as, without help to obtain a situation, cannot possibly provide a home and support their families. Now Brother A will have a chance to help himself. He is a hard worker, but circumstances he could not control have kept him in poverty. We must help such ones. They are God's precious jewels. Now we have this family where we can do something for them. We packed a basket full of the clothing you left to be appropriated. Brother B received his portion, and Brother A will receive his portion, which will be highly appreciated. I want you to know that they feel highly favored with these goods.--Letter 61, 1899, p. 3. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, April 2, 1899.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. February 15, 1979",
