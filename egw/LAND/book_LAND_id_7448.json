    "word": "If a change does not take place during the council meeting now being held in Washington, it may be that I shall have to go to Battle Creek, and bear a decided testimony for God and for the truth in behalf of God's people. Things have been allowed to drift so far and so fast that I dare not hesitate now. If the Lord bids me to go, be assured that I shall be in Battle Creek this winter; and the things that I could have said at the conference in Oakland, but that I hoped I would never need to say, God will strengthen me to say. I will speak whatever may be the consequences. I can not stand by silent, and see God dishonored and his people divided and spoiled by Satan's workings. Were I to do so, I should be unfaithful to my trust. I will continue to stand for truth, for exalted principles.",
