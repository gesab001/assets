Let the sale of \"Christ's Object Lessons\" be taken hold of interestedly in our large cities and in the smaller \n\n\n                                   -204- \n\nsettlements. Brethren, wake up. The good hand of the Lord has been with our people in the selection of a good place to locate the school. This place corresponds to the representations given me as to where the school would be located. It is away from the cities, and there is an abundance of land for agricultural purposes, and room so that the houses will not need to be built one close to another. There is plenty of ground where students shall be educated to educate the land. \"Ye and God's husbandry: ye are God's building.\"",
