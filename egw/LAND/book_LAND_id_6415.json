    "word": "Will you inquire of Mrs. Dr. Larkins if she is free to engage in the Crystal Springs Sanitarium? If she should, make arrangements for her to do so. This institution is located in St. Helena. She may have seen it. It has almost every advantage healthwise, but needs physicians who understand their business. I go to St. Helena next week and then will write again.
