    "word": "During the [early] days of the Advent Movement, the first and the second angels' messages were proclaimed with power in Portland, Maine.

In times past we have attended camp meetings in that city that have been well attended. The power of God has been manifested. Those connected with the courts, and others high in office, have come out to hear.",
