    "word": "\"It has been a strange thing to me that there were so few who felt a burden to labor for the Jewish people, who are scattered throughout so many lands. Christ will be with you as you strive to strengthen your perceptive faculties, that you may more clearly behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. The slumbering faculties of the Jewish people are to be aroused. The Old Testament Scriptures, blending with the New, will be to them as the dawning of a new creation, or as the resurrection of the soul. Memory will be awakened as Christ is seen portrayed in the pages of the Old Testament. Souls will be saved from the Jewish nation, as the doors of the New Testament are unlocked with the key of the Old Testament. Christ will be recognized as the Saviour of the world, as it is seen how clearly the New Testament explains the Old. To them the words will be fulfilled, 'As many as received Him to them \n                                                                           10\ngave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.' They will be changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. They will be partakers of the divine nature. The image of divinity will be stamped upon their souls. If they will continue to learn of Christ, they will attain to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.",
