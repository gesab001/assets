    "word": "MR No. 1288 - Consultation Regarding the Work of G. C. Tenney; Prayer Offered for G. A. Anderson and Others\n\n     (Diary entry written April 26, 1893, in Wellington, New Zealand.) \n\n     Willie and I have [had a] consultation in regard to Elder Tenney. Shall a telegram be sent to Elder Tenney to remain in America, or to return to Australia? We felt--both Willie and myself--that for several reasons it would be wisdom for him to return. The impression has been entertained by some that it was a scheme concocted by our American brethren to have him go to America to the General Conference and then manage to have him remain there. We do not want the brethren in Australia to have this impression--that W.C.W. and I have been working in an underhanded manner, because it is not true. We looked the situation all over and decided that Elder Tenney should attend the General Conference. After being separated so long from the great center of the work he had lost the impressions that are essential for him to have in regard to the management and progress of the work.",
