Beginning with an open attack on the pope's supremacy, they were soon silenced by the authorities; but being unwilling to relinquish their purpose, they had recourse to other measures. Being artists as well as preachers, they proceeded to exercise their skill. In a place open to the public they drew two pictures. One represented the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem, \u201cmeek, and sitting upon an ass\u201d [Matthew 21:5.] and followed by his disciples in travel-worn garments and with naked feet. The other picture \n100\nportrayed a pontifical procession,\u2014the pope arrayed in his rich robes and triple crown, mounted upon a horse magnificently adorned, preceded by trumpeters, and followed by cardinals and prelates in dazzling array.",
