    "word": "Provide Land for Poor Families.--Where the school is established [in Australia] there must be land for orchards and gardens, that students may have physical exercise combined with mental taxation, and half and some wholly pay their way at school. Also ground must be purchased, that families that cannot obtain work in the cities because of the observance of the Sabbath may buy small farms and make their own living. This is a positive necessity in this country. \n                                                                           185\nEducation must be given in regard to tilling the soil, and we must expect that the Lord will bless this effort. --Manuscript 23, 1894.",
