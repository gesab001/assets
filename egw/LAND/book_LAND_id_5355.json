    "word": "The candidates were immersed in a river running through a beautiful green paddock of undulating ground, dotted with clusters of trees. About 200 people came out to witness the baptism, and besides these, there were fully one hundred on the opposite bank of the river. An organ was placed under a cluster of trees near the river, and the singing was excellent. . . . Seven precious souls were buried with our Lord in baptism. . . . Last week I received a letter asking me to go again to Maitland. There are eight more to be baptized.--Letter 15, 1900, pp. 2-4. (To Brother George Lay, February 1, 1900.)",
