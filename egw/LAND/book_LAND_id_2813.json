    "word": "Commercialism Reproved at Mountain View.--While at St. Helena, again and again it has been revealed to me that there was not a correct state of things at Mountain View; that there were present the very conditions that made it essential for the publishing work to be removed from Oakland. [THE ORIGINAL WEST COAST PRINTING HOUSE IN OAKLAND WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1874. BECAUSE OF GROWING WORK AND THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE CITY ENVIRONMENT, THE PUBLISHING HOUSE WAS MOVED TO MOUNTAIN VIEW IN 1904. THE DESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF JULY 20, 1906, EFFECTIVELY SETTLED THE PROBLEM OF COMMERCIAL PRINTING.] I saw that in the working out of human ideas and plans there was a disregarding of the light God had given in the past to correct existing evils. There is danger that the experience of the past will be repeated. The men who are serving in the management of the work can just as surely swerve the work into lines of commercialism as in the past.",
