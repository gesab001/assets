    "word": "We left San Diego about ten days ago and came to Los Angeles, where we spent a few days at the Glendale Sanitarium. From there we went to Redlands, where we are now. Redlands is about 65 miles from Los Angeles. We are staying with Brother and Sister E. S. Ballenger. A series of tent meetings was held recently both in Redlands and in Riverside, and a church was raised up in each place. Brother Ballenger was anxious that I should speak to the believers in these two places. This morning I spoke in the Redlands church. I spoke for 30 minutes, and could have spoken longer, but dared not venture. This is the first time that I have been able to speak in public for four weeks.",
