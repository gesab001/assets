    "word": "Friday night eleven came from Chaux-de-fonds and our meeting room was in a good-sized room of Brother Roth's house. I was requested to speak to those assembled, and did so, although I was much tired. I did not sleep until after midnight. When before the people I feel so deeply in earnest that they should come up to the holy standard erected by our Lord that I am unable to lay off the burden.--Ms 64, 1886, p. 4. (\"Labors in Switzerland\"--No. 5. Diary, April 30 to May 23, 1886.)",
