    "word": "Near Redlands and Riverside \n\n     \"I hope Brother -----, that when you see a suitable place in Redlands, which could be used as a sanitarium, offered for sale at a suitable price, you will let us know about it. We shall need a sanitarium in Redlands. Unless we start an enterprise of this kind, others will. I understand that the property owners are afraid that consumptives will come in, and thus the reputation of the place be spoiled. But, of course, we should make it clear that we are not going to establish a consumptive's home.",
