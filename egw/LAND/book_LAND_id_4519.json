    "word": "God has given us instruction that every child of His has a work to do. To everyone is given talents according to his several ability. To minister for Christ, it is not necessary for a man to be a preacher. There are many who, though they do not feel that they have been set apart for the special work of preaching, are, nevertheless, ministering for Christ. The Sun of Righteousness shines upon them, and they reveal that they are one with Christ. The Word of God is the man of their counsel. As they study the Scriptures they are enabled to understand what they read. They work in unity with one another. There will be no discordant opinions among those who are taught by God. True saints are one in spirit and action. The Holy Spirit binds them together, and all the power of satanic agencies cannot break this union.--Manuscript 176, Nov. 14, 1899, \"Diary,\" written in Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia.",
