    "word": "\"We now have three sanitariums in the Southern part of the State. Loma Linda, the one most recently purchased, is the most desirable place I have ever seen for a sanitarium. We realize that the Lord has been very gracious to us in opening the way for us to secure this plant. Until I saw Loma Linda, I could not feel that I had seen the place that seemed in every respect to correspond with the representation that I had seen of what a sanitarium should be. I had been instructed to say to our brethren that we should have a sanitarium near Redlands and Riverside. This institution is about five miles from Redlands, and ten from Riverside. But I had no idea that we would be able to purchase Loma Linda, though we had heard that the owners were very anxious to sell \n\n2 \n\nthe property. While I was at Takoma Park, attending the General Conference, I received a letter from Brother Burden, describing the property at Loma Linda, and informing me that the place was offered for sale for forty thousand dollars. The description given answered in every respect to that of places that I had been instructed would be offered far below their original cost.",
