There sit in the boat five natives nearly naked with a cotton . . . cloth of some bright color about their loins, a turban on their heads, [unclothed on] the arms, legs and bodies with the exception of the one piece of cloth about the loins. Here they come in all kinds of boats loaded with fruits--bananas, pineapple, limes, oranges, fruit as green as grass, . . . oranges, melons--pictures of the natives, pictures of the scenery on the island.",
