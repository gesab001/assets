    "word": "If you open your minds and hearts to the insinuations and suggestions of Satan, you will be led to act a part similar to that of the unfaithful spies. Instead of trusting in God to bring victory, instead of inspiring hearts with firm faith in the leadings of his Spirit, you will talk and act as did the spies. Can you afford to do this? No, no; let your voice be heard echoing the words of faithful Caleb, concerning the land of promise: \"Let us go up at once and possess it.\" Caleb and Joshua \"spake unto all the children of Israel, saying, The land which we passed through to search it, is an exceedingly good land. If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it, to us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the Lord is with us: fear them not.\" This is the spirit that dwelt in Caleb and Joshua.",
