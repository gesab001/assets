    "word": "Fog, Lesson From.--We came to Russel Harbor, Australia, a small place, but quite interesting in appearance; mountains were all around this place except where it was on the water side. This seemed to be the stopping place for most of the passengers. In approaching Russel there were islands of rocks and on the sides of the rocks were trees and vegetation growing very high up; and as we thought we were going straight into harbor the anchor was cast, for a fog had settled down upon us. The Captain said, \"We are caught in a fog, and I will not run any risks, for the peril may involve the boat and passengers.\" And we honored his judgment.",
