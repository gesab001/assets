    "word": "After the truth has been proclaimed as a witness to all nations, at a time when every conceivable power of evil is set in operation, when minds are confused by the many voices crying, \"Lo, here is Christ.\" \"Lo, He is there;\" \"this is truth.\" \"I have the message from God;\" \"He has sent me with great light;\" and there is a removing of the landmarks, and an attempt to tear down the pillars of our faith,--then a more decided effort is made to exalt the false sabbath, and to cast contempt upon God himself by supplanting the day He has blessed and sanctified. This false sabbath is to be enforced by an oppressive law. Satan and his angels are wide awake and intensely active, working with energy and perseverance through human instrumentalities to bring about his purpose of obliterating the knowledge of God. While Satan is working with his lying wonders, the time has come foretold in the Revelation, when the mighty angel that shall lighten the earth with his glory will proclaim the fall of Babylon and call upon God's people to forsake her. \n                                                                           727",
