I have had much light and experience in regard to these movements, and I wish to state that when the Lord gives our brethren special light in regard to this enterprise, it will be time enough for them to move, and they can build a new institution with safety. You need not take this extra burden upon you, for God is not in it. We have no men to whom we can look to manage such an institution. Dr. Maxson has not the qualifications that will fit him to stand as manager at the head of such a large institution as should be established in a suburb of Oakland, for it is an important center.",
