    "word": "The day after we reached Los Angeles, several of us went out to see the sanitarium building at Glendale. I think you told me that you have seen this building. I think it is well adapted for sanitarium purposes, and that it is in a beautiful location. At present preparations are being made for the opening of the institution. Bath rooms are being put up, and those who come for treatment will be given good accommodations. I went over the whole building, and I am very much pleased with all the arrangements. The sanitarium has five acres of land. I wish there was more land in connection with the building, but still, it is certainly in the country, for there are no buildings very near it. It is surrounded by large fields of strawberries, and by orange orchards. And they have enough land to furnish all the patients who wish with outdoor employment, which is of such benefit to those who wish to regain their health.",
