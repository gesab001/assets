    "word": "Not all can fill the same place; but everyone who yields himself to the consecrating influence of the Holy Spirit will be under the control of Christ, and for consecrated men and women God has made full provision. He will carry on His work by a variety of ways and instruments. It is not alone the most talented, not alone those who hold high positions of trust, or are the most highly educated, that the Lord will use in His work of soul-saving. He will use many who have had few advantages. By the use of simple means He will bring those who own property and land to a belief of the truth; and these will become God's helping hand in the advancement of His work. It is not always the brightest talent that accomplishes the most for God. The Lord can speak through anyone who is consecrated to His service.",
