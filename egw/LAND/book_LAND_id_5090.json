There is altogether too congested a state of things. The school, although it will mean a fewer number of students, ought to be moved out of Battle Creek. Get an extensive tract of land, and there begin the work which I entreated should be commenced before our school was established here,--to get out of the city to a place where the students would not see things to remark upon and criticise; where they would not see the wayward course of this one and that one, but would settle down to diligent study. God wants the school to be taken out of Battle Creek. Some may be stirred about the transfer of the school from Battle Creek, but they need not be.\"",
