    "word": "In view of that great day the Word of God, in the most solemn and impressive language, calls upon his people to arouse from their spiritual lethargy, and to seek his face with repentance and humiliation: \u201cBlow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand.\u201d \u201cSanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly. Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children. . . . Let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out \n311\nof her closet. Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar.\u201d \u201cTurn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning. And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness.\u201d [Joel 2:1, 15-18, 12, 13.]",
