    "word": "In our schools we have a very special work to do in educating and training workers. We must hold fast to God, praying to Him to do that work that mortals cannot accomplish. The gospel message must be borne in this locality. The work done in this school will be carried far and near, even to the ends of the earth. There are tracts of this moral wilderness that will be added to the garden of the Lord. The church must work, and everyone who names the name of Christ must depart from all selfishness, and from all iniquity. Those who compose the church must become full of life and vitality. Then regions of unsightly barrenness and drouth will be made like the garden of the Lord. --Ms 120, 1898 (Written September 24, 1898). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nJanuary 11, 1990. Entire Ms.",
