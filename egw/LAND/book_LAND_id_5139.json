    "word": "I had the privilege of being with my oldest boy two weeks. He is a lovely dispositioned boy. He became so attached to his mother, it was hard to be separated from him; but as our time is all employed in writing and folding and wrapping papers, I am denied the privilege of having his company. \n                                                                           32\nMy other little one is many hundred miles from me. Sometimes Satan tempts me to complain and think my lot is a hard one, but I will not harbor this temptation. I should not want to live unless I could live to do some good to others. Letter 30, 1850, pp. 2, 3. (To Brother and Sister Loveland, December 13, 1850.)",
