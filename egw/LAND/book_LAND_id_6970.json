    "word": "The tent has been taken down, and Brother Colcord is holding meetings in a small hall connected with the house in which the mission family live. Brother and Sister James from Ballaret have charge of the mission home. They both labor as they can to instruct the people. Sisters Wilson and Robertson have been and are doing a good work in Maitland. The Lord sustains them, and they have many friends. In the past they have had to walk three and four miles to give their readings, but now they have a horse and buggy.",
