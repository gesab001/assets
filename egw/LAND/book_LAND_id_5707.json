    "word": "Christ ordained the twelve to preach the gospel of His kingdom. It was in the same line as giving Bible readings. \"As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand\" (Matthew 10:7). Read the chapter. \"And into whatsoever city ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. And when ye come into an house salute it. And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you\" (verses 11-13). There must be peace in the houses where their call is given. Their labor was not to be lost, producing no good results. They must use judgment and discrimination as to whether the master \n\n\n                                    -89- \n\nof the house was of those to whom they should give their labor, and not waste their precious strength and time. They were not to remunerate all they visited, but to be provided for by the houses they visited, and this was to be the test as to where they should give time and instruction. \"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues\" (verses 14-17). This would be experienced in the fullest sense. . . .",
