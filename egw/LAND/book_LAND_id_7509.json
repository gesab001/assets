    "word": "To Our People in the Southern States. \n\n                                 Washington, D. C., June 8, 1909. \n\nBrethren Sutherland and Magan:-- \n     I am instructed to say to you, Be careful as to what moves you now make. You have had many hindrances to your work, and at times you have been greatly bound about by difficulties, so that at times it seemed almost impossible to advance in the work that the Lord desired you to do. You have had many discouragements, but the Lord's directing care has been over you. You need now to be careful that you do not take one step in a path where he is not going before you and guiding you. You should not leave your present field of labor unless you have clear evidence that it is the Lord's will for you to do so.",
