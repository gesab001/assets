    "word": "MR No. 582 - A Rural College\n\n     You say, You have not answered my question [THE QUESTION WAS: \"WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE [OLD] SCHOOL BUILDING? SHALL WE SELL IT TO THE SANITARIUM? SHALL WE ESTABLISH SCHOOLS IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES?\"--LETTER 75, 1898, P. 1.] yet. I would say, The same reasons that have led us to move away from the city and locate our school here [Avondale, Australia], stand good with you in America. The money that is expended in buildings, when they are thousands of dollars in debt, is not in God's order. In this you are not following the path that God has marked out. The counsel of God has not been regarded. Had the money which has been expended in adding to the college building been invested in procuring land in connection with the school, you would not have so large a number of students, with their debts increasing, in the city of Battle Creek.",
