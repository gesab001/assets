    "word": "Southampton was one of the earliest Roman settlements. Its history reaches back to the ninth century. At the present time it has, with its suburban villages, a population of over one hundred thousand. Here we saw the old Roman wall and gates with towers above, which were once used as courts of justice. Although built over nine hundred years ago, the wall in many places has not been impaired by age. It was in this place that our mission in England was first established, and here it remained till 1884, when it was removed to Grimsby.",
