    "word": "Our Duty to the Missionary Work\n     The members of the church are not all called to labor in foreign lands, but all have a part to act in the great work of giving light to the world. The gospel \n291\nof Christ is aggressive and diffusive. In the day of God not one will be excused for having been shut up to his own selfish interests. There is work for every mind and for every hand. There is a variety of work, adapted to different minds and varied capabilities. Every one who is connected with God will impart light to others. If there are any who have no light to give, it is because they have no connection with the Source of light.",
