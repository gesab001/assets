    "word": "Preach the Third Angel's Message; Avoid Trivial Topics\n\n(A morning talk given at Grimsby, England, Sept. 21, 1886.)\n\n     However much we know of the Scriptures it is important that we know still more. \"Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall\" (1 Corinthians 10:12). One man may think he understands the Scriptures and go out to present the truth, and yet he may be lacking on some points. We may get the heart and mind fixed upon something that has no special bearing upon the true point.",
