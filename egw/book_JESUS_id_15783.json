They need to be transformed by the grace of God. When Nicodemus, a great teacher in Israel, came to Jesus, the Master laid before him the conditions of divine life, teaching him the very alphabet of conversion. Nicodemus asked: \"How can these things be?\" \"Art thou a master of Israel,\" Christ \n                                                                           155\nanswered, \"and knowest not these things?\" This question might be addressed to many who are now holding positions as teachers, but who have neglected the preparation essential to qualify them for this work.
