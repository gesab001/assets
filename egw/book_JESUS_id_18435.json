{"word": "E. G. White's Experience in Visitation.--I remember when the converting power of God came upon me in my childhood I wanted everyone else to get the blessing that I had, and I could not rest till I had told them of it. I began to visit with my young companions and went to their houses to talk with them and tell them my experience, how precious the Saviour was to me, and how I wanted to serve Him, and how I wanted them to serve Him also. So I would talk of the preciousness of Christ, and I would say, \"Won't you kneel down and pray with me?\" Some would kneel and some would sit in their chairs, but before we gave up, everyone would be on her knees and we would pray together for hours, till the last one would say, \"I believe that Jesus has forgiven me my sins.\" Sometimes the sun would begin to make its appearance in the heavens before I would give up the struggle. There is a great power in Jesus.--Manuscript 10, 1888.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 99}
