{"word": "Feeling the terrible power of temptation, the drawing of desire that leads to indulgence, many a man cries in despair, \"I cannot resist evil.\" Tell him that he can, that he must, resist. He may have been overcome again and again, but it need not be always thus. He is weak in moral power, controlled by the habits of a life of sin. His promises and resolutions are like ropes of sand. The knowledge of his broken promises and forfeited pledges weakens his confidence in his own sincerity and causes him to feel that God cannot accept him or work with his efforts. But he need not despair. --MH 174, 175 (1905).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 737}
