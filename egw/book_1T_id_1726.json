    "word": "PAGE 210, ORGANIZATION--UP TO THE YEAR 1860 THERE HAD BEEN NO LEGAL OR CHURCH ORGANIZATION AMONG THE SABBATHKEEPING ADVENTISTS. THEY HAD NOT EVEN ADOPTED A NAME. THEY SPOKE OF THEMSELVES AS THE \"SCATTERED FLOCK,\" THE \"LITTLE REMNANT,\" OR SOME VARIATION OF SUCH EXPRESSIONS. NOW ELDER WHITE HAD ANNOUNCED THROUGH THE REVIEW THAT HE MUST REFUSE TO CONTINUE TO ASSUME PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONEY LENT TO THE REVIEW AND HERALD OFFICE. HE FURTHER EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THE TIME MIGHT SOON COME WHEN \"THIS PEOPLE WILL BE IN THAT POSITION NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO GET CHURCH PROPERTY INSURED, HOLD THEIR MEETING HOUSES IN A PROPER MANNER, THAT THOSE PERSONS MAKING THEIR WILLS, AND WISHING TO DO SO, CAN APPROPRIATE A PORTION TO THE PUBLISHING DEPARTMENT.\" HE CALLED UPON HIS BRETHREN TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW THIS DESIRE MIGHT BE EFFECTED SO THAT \"WE AS A PEOPLE\" MIGHT ACT TO SECURE THE ABOVE ADVANTAGES.",
