{"word": "Innocent Offspring Will Be Sufferers.--Diseased children are born because of the gratification of appetite by the parents. The system did not demand the variety of food upon which the mind dwelt. Because once in the mind it must be in the stomach is a great error which Christian women should reject. Imagination should not be allowed to control the wants of the system. Those who allow the taste to rule will suffer the penalty of transgressing the laws of their being. And the matter does not end here; their innocent offspring also will be sufferers.--2T 383 (1870).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 133}
