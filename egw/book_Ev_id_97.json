{"word": "Securing City Evangelists.--Now, when the Lord bids us to proclaim the message once more with power in the East, when He bids us enter the cities of the East and of the South and of the North and of the West, shall we not respond as one man and do His bidding? Shall we not plan to send messengers all through these fields and support them liberally? . . . \n                                                                           40\nAll our cities are to be worked. The Lord is coming. The end is near; yea, it hasteth greatly! In a little while from this we shall be unable to work with the freedom that we now enjoy. Terrible scenes are before us, and what we do we must do quickly. We must now build up the work in every place possible. And for the accomplishment of this work we greatly need in the field the help that can be given by our ministers of experience who are able to hold the attention of large congregations. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 39}
