    "word": "Rising from His prostrate position, He came to His disciples and found them sleeping. He said unto Peter: \"What, could ye not watch with Me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" At the most important time--the time when Jesus had made a special request for them to watch with Him--the disciples were found sleeping. He knew that severe conflicts and terrible temptations were before them. He had taken them with Him that they might be a strength to Him, and that the events they should witness that night, and the lessons of instruction they should receive, might be indelibly printed upon their memories. This was necessary that their faith might not fail, but be strengthened for the test just before them.",
