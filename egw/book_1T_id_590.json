    "word": "The case of Ananias and Sapphira was presented before me to illustrate the course of those who put down their property below its value. They pretended to make a freewill offering of their possessions to the Lord. Said Peter: \"Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much?\" The answer was: \"Yea, for so much.\" Some in this evil age would not consider that a lie. But the Lord regarded it thus. They had sold it for so much, and much more. They had professed to consecrate all to God. To Him they had dissembled, and their retribution lingered not.",
