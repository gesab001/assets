    "word": "Chap. 95 - Obedience to the Truth\n\n     Dear Brother D: I recollect your countenance among several others that were shown me in vision in Rochester, New York, December 25, 1865. I was shown that you were upon the background. Your judgment is convinced that we have the truth, but you have not as yet experienced its sanctifying influence. You have not followed closely the footsteps of our Redeemer, therefore you are unprepared to walk even as He walked. As you listen to the words of truth, your judgment says that it is correct, it cannot be gainsaid; but immediately the unsanctified heart says: \"These are hard sayings, who can hear them? you would better give up your efforts to keep pace with the people of God, for new and strange and trying things will be continually arising; you will have to stop sometime, and you may just as well stop now, and better than to go further.\"",
