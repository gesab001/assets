{"word": "A Dorcas society is to open this week to examine and remodel old and new material to help the needy. The members of my family and I have made many donations of money and clothing. The draft upon us has not been small. We do not have to hunt up cases; they hunt us up. These things are forced upon our notice; we cannot be Christians and pass them by, and say, \"Be ye warmed and clothed,\" and do not those things that will warm and clothe them. \n                                                                           332\nThe Lord Jesus says, \"The poor always ye have with you.\" They are God's legacy to us.--Manuscript 4, 1895.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 331}
