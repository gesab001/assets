    "word": "\"ALL AT ONCE WE CAME TO A TURNTABLE, LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THE WHOLE TRAIN. BROTHER AND SISTER WHITE WERE STANDING THERE AND, AS I STEPPED OFF THE TRAIN, THEY SAID: 'THIS TRAIN IS GOING ALL WRONG. IT MUST BE TURNED SQUARE ABOUT.' THEY BOTH LAID HOLD OF CRANKS THAT MOVED THE MACHINERY TURNING THE TABLE AND TUGGED WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT. NEVER DID MEN WORK HARDER PROPELLING A HANDCAR THAN THEY DID AT THE CRANKS OF THE TURNTABLE. I STOOD AND WATCHED TILL I SAW THE TRAIN BEGINNING TO TURN, WHEN I SPOKE OUT AND SAID, 'IT MOVES,' AND LAID HOLD TO HELP THEM. I PAID BUT LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE TRAIN, WE WERE SO INTENT UPON PERFORMING OUR LABOR OF TURNING THE TABLE.",
