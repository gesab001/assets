{"word": "Many Troubled by Evil Thoughts.--There are many who are really troubled because low, debasing thoughts \n\n\n                                                  659 \n\ncome into the mind and are not easily banished. Satan has his evil angels around us, and though they cannot read men's thoughts, they closely watch their words and actions. Satan takes advantage of the weaknesses and defects of character that are thus revealed and presses his temptations where there is the least power of resistance. He makes evil suggestions and inspires worldly thoughts, knowing that he can thus bring the soul into condemnation and bondage. To those who are selfish, worldly, avaricious, proud, faultfinding, or given to detraction--to all who are cherishing errors and defects of character--Satan presents the indulgence of self and leads the soul off upon a track that the Bible condemns, but which he makes appear attractive.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 658}
