{"word": "Bible Study \n\n     The urgent necessities that are making themselves felt in this time demand a constant education in the word of God. This is present truth. Throughout the world there should be a reform in Bible study, for it is needed now as never before. As this reform progresses, a mighty work will be wrought; for when God declared that His word should not return unto Him void, He meant all that He said. A knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ \"whom He has sent\" is the highest education, and it will cover the earth with its wonderful enlightenment as the waters cover the sea.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "6T", "page": 131}
