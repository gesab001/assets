He can bear witness to that which he himself has seen and heard and felt of the power of Christ. He can testify: \"I needed help, and I found it in Jesus. Every want was supplied, the hunger of my soul was satisfied; the Bible is to me the revelation of Christ. I believe in Jesus because He is to me a divine Saviour. I believe the Bible because I have found it to be the voice of God to my soul.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 252}
