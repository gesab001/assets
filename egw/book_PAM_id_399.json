{"word": "This peril is well illustrated by an incident that is related concerning a Hebrew family on the night of the passover. The legend goes that the eldest daughter was sick; but that she was acquainted with the fact that a lamb was to be chosen for every family, and that its blood was to be sprinkled upon the lintel and side posts of the door so that the Lord might behold the mark of the blood, and not suffer the destroyer to enter in to smite the first-born. With what anxiety she saw the evening approach when the destroying angel was to pass by. She became very restless. She called her father to her side, and asked, \"Have you marked the door-post with blood?\" He answered, \"Yes; I have given directions in regard to the matter. Do not be troubled; for the destroying angel will not enter here.\" The night came on, and again and again the child called her father, still asking, \"Are you sure that the door-post is marked with blood?\" Again and again the father assured her that she need have no fear; that a command which involved such consequences would not be neglected by his trustworthy servants.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 168}
