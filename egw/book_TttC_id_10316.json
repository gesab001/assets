    "word": "We are to present the truth in the love of Christ. No extravagance or display should attend the work. It is to be done after Christ's order. It is to be carried forward in humility, in the simplicity of the gospel. Let not the workers be intimidated by outward appearances, how ever forbidding. Teach the word, and the Lord by His Holy Spirit will send conviction to the hearers.",
