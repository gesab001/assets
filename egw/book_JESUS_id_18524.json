{"word": "In order to serve God acceptably, we must be \"born again.\" Our natural dispositions, which are in opposition to the Spirit of God, must be put away. We must be made new men and women in Christ Jesus. Our old, unrenewed lives must give place to a new life--a life full of love, of trust, of willing obedience. Think you that such a change is not necessary for entrance into the kingdom of God? Listen to the words of the Majesty of heaven: \"Ye must be born again\" (John 3:7). \"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 18:3). Unless the change takes place, we cannot serve God aright. Our work will be defective; earthly plans will be brought in; strange fire, dishonoring to God, will be offered. Our lives will be unholy and unhappy, full of unrest and trouble.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 24}
