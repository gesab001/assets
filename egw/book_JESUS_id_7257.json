{"word": "Christ did not make-believe take human nature; He did verily take it. He did in reality possess human nature. \"As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same.\" He was the son of Mary; He was of the seed of David according to human descent. He is declared to be a man, even the Man Christ Jesus. \"This man,\" writes Paul, \"was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than the house.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 74}
