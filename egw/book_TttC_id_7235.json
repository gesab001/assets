    "word": "God has scattered His children in various communities that the light of truth may be kept shining amid the moral darkness that enshrouds the earth.

Among the Christians at Rome in Paul's day the apostle mentions them \"that are of Caesar's household.\" Nowhere could the moral atmosphere be more unfavorable to Christianity than at that Roman court under the cruel and profligate Nero. Yet those who had, while in the emperor's service, accepted Christ did not feel at liberty, after their conversion, to leave their post of duty. In the face of seductive temptations, fierce opposition, and appalling dangers they were faithful witnesses for Christ.",
