{"word": "The great work that is wrought for the sinner who is spotted and stained by evil is the work of justification. By Him who speaketh truth he is declared righteous. The Lord imputes unto the believer the righteousness of Christ and pronounces him righteous before the universe. He transfers his sins to Jesus, the sinner's representative, substitute, and surety. Upon Christ He lays the iniquity of every soul that believeth. \"He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\" 2 Corinthians 5:21. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 112}
