{"word": "But Jesus did not bid the disciples, \"Strive to make your light shine;\" He said, \"Let it shine.\" If Christ is dwelling in the heart, it is impossible to conceal the light of His presence. If those who profess to be followers of Christ are not the light of the world, it is because the vital power has left them; if they have no light to give, it is because they have no connection with the Source of light.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MB", "page": 41}
