{"word": "Satan's Work to Discourage; Christ's to Inspire Hope.--Do not for a moment acknowledge Satan's temptations as being in harmony with your own mind. Turn from them as you would from the adversary himself. Satan's work is to discourage the soul. Christ's work is to inspire the heart with faith and hope. Satan seeks to unsettle our confidence. He tells us that our hopes are built upon false premises rather than upon the sure, immutable word of Him who cannot lie.--MS 31, 1911. (HC 85.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 32}
