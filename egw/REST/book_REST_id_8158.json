He spake as one having authority, and yet He invites the confidence of all. \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\u201d (Matthew 11:28-30).",
