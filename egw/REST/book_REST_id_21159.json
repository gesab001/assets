    "word": "I am very grateful to my heavenly Father for keeping me by His power when I have stood so long carrying the heavy load. Brother Metcalfe Hare has united with me in all the interests connected with our school. Two school buildings are now erected. They are wholesome, convenient, neat, and well-proportioned buildings. There is nothing ornamental about them, for we have not one penny to spend in needless extras. One building is only enclosed. We had no money to pay for plastering. But we are full of gratitude to God. All here who are of the faith worked with a will in helping to finish the buildings. They are poor, but they did what they could and went beyond our expectations, and we know that they realized the blessing of the Lord.",
