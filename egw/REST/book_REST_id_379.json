    "word": "Henry, you are my first-born, the eldest of my boys. A responsibility rests upon you. You will have to render an account for the influence you exert over your brothers. Love your brothers. Their salvation depends much on the course you pursue. Have your regular seasons of prayer for each other, and with each other. Don't let your love for writing, [THE ARTIST HAS GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE LIKENESS A FACSIMILE OF HIS HAND WRITING, TAKEN FROM A BUSINESS NOTE. A.P.P.] and your study, divert your mind, and cause you to neglect those duties which ought to be done.",
