    "word": "I have taken my position, brethren. I am not going to enter into controversy over anything that may be presented. Last night I woke at ten o'clock and remained awake for several hours. During that time the whole matter was laid open before me, and I was instructed that I must bear the testimony given me and then leave matters with the Lord. It is not my work to try to make people believe the message given me. When the assertion is made, \"Someone has told her,\" I am to make no response. On that point the conflict is over for me. I shall tell you the truth as it is in Jesus. And when anyone comes to me to know about this thing or that thing, I shall point them to the One who has said, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30).-- Ms. 46, 1904. (MR 900.1)",
