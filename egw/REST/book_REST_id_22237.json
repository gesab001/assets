    "word": "God became one with man when, in the council between the Father and the Son in heaven it was determined that if man fell from his allegiance, the Son of God should be his Redeemer and restore in him the moral image of God. How was it to be done? \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, . . . full of grace and truth.\" John 1:14. \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" Matthew 5:48. Christ's oneness with the Father brings us into close union, through the Son of God, with the Father.",
