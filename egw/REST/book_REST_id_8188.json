    "word": "Do not be overanxious about anything. Go quietly about your duty which the day brings you. Do the best you can; ask God to be your helper. . . . Feel every day, \"I am doing my work for God. I am not living for myself, to glorify myself, but to glorify God.\" Oh, trust in Jesus and not in your own heart! Cast your burden and yourself upon Him. If you feel no joy, no consolation, do not be discouraged. Hope and believe. You may have a precious experience in the things of God. Wrestle with your discouragements and doubts until you gain the victory over them in Jesus' name. Do not encourage grief, despondency, and darkness. . . . Repose in the broad, sure promises of God. Rest in these promises, without a doubt.",
