    "word": "MR No. 1194 - The Value of Health Reform in Our Homes and Institutions\n\n      (Written August 5, 1892, from North Fitzroy, to Dr. J. H. Kellogg.) \n\n     All that you have written in your last letter I read with great interest. That which you say in regard to the matter of physicians having professional badges, I fully endorse. Christian physicians need no badge except that of Christianity. The use of drugs is not in accordance with God's plan. Physicians should understand how to treat the sick through the use of nature's remedies. Pure air, pure water, healthful exercise, should be employed in the treatment of the sick.",
