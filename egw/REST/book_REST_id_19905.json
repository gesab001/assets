    "word": "EGW Prays That God Will Let JHK See Where He Stands--Last night, after going to rest, I wrestled in earnest prayer for you until eleven o'clock. Then I slept until three. I then rose and dressed, and continued my prayer that God would draw back the curtain and let you see where you stand. I have felt that it was of little use for me to write more to you, for the many letters that I have written do not seem to have that [effect] which I so much hoped they would accomplish. And yet my burden does not leave me, because you cannot see yourself as God sees you.",
