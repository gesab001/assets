    "word": "We should not come together to remain silent; those only are remembered of the Lord, who come together to honor and glorify him, to speak of his glory, and tell of his power; and upon such the blessing of God will rest, and they will be refreshed. If all moved as I saw they should, no precious time would run to waste, and no reproofs would be needed for long prayers and exhortations; for all the time would be occupied by short, sweet testimonies, and prayers to the point. Ask, believe and receive. There is too much mocking God, too much praying that is no praying, and that wearies angels and displeases God. Too many vain, unmeaning petitions. First we should feel needy, and then ask God for the very things we need, and then believe he gives them to us, even while we ask; and then, I saw, that our faith would grow, all would be edified, the weak would be strengthened, the discouraged and desponding made to look up, and believe that God is a rewarder of all those who diligently seek him.",
