    "word": "Remember that every soul striving to advance in the divine life finds every inch of ground disputed by an antagonistic force, and he must gird himself for the conflict by earnest prayer, and fight the good fight of faith. He is called to \"wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places\" (Ephesians 6:12). We cannot afford to be found warring against each other.

Brethren, seek God. Seek Him while He is to be found, call ye upon Him while He is nigh.",
