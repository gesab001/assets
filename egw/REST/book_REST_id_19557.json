    "word": "A mere theory of the truth is powerless. It needs the heavenly endorsement, the finish that God alone can give it. Every petition put up in faith is lodged in heaven and will not be neglected, but will bring precious returns. I saw that there was too little praying, too little humbling the soul before God, too little laying hold above and importuning and earnest wrestling with God that He may make His truth like a sharp, two-edged sword, to cut every way. There has been more trusting in reading and studying than in the power of God. A Paul may plant and an Apollos water, but God giveth the increase (1 Corinthians 3:6, 7). God's ministers have more knowledge than living faith and godliness. These treasures all should seek after earnestly. Then will they exercise temperance in reading, in studying. They will depend more on the Spirit of God and His power to set home the truth to the hearts of the hearers than upon knowledge obtained from much reading. The theory of truth without the power of God will produce but little effect.",
