    "word": "Dear brethren, He who has given you talents, has by these sacred trusts made you capable of bearing precious fruit to his glory. Through Christ, God has opened heaven before you, and all needful grace is brought within your reach. The Saviour died that by his grace you might become partakers of the divine nature. He expects you to bear fruit. With what interest has he watched and waited for some returns for his great sacrifice.",
