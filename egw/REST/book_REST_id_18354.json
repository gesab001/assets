    "word": "I love your soul. I have been deeply interested in you. I want you to be right with God. I greatly desire you should be truly and unmistakably converted to God and sanctified through the truth. Eternal life is worth everything to you, or it is worth nothing. Truth will produce beauty in the soul. A mere profession of faith will never save you, for it is as a sounding brass and tinkling cymbal. God forbid that you should longer remain in a deception, that the fountain which should send forth sweet water should be poisoned; the vine which should bear rich clusters of grapes produce only wild berries.",
