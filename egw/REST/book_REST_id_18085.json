    "word": "Teachers generally do not feel that they have great responsibilities resting upon them, and that their efforts should in some measure correspond with their responsibilities. They do not impress upon the minds of their pupils that the object in their education should be to qualify them to bring into practical use the powers with which God has endowed them; and to do this in such a manner as will accomplish the greatest amount of good, and thereby answer the object of their existence.",
