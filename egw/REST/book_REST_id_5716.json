    "word": "We reached Frankfort Wednesday morning about daylight, where we waited two hours. As it was raining, we saw but little of the city. We found the waiting room very pleasant, being large, and furnished with tables, chairs and comfortable sofas, and well supplied with maps and guide books. We spread our lunch upon one of the tables, and with the addition of hot milk from the restaurant, enjoyed our simple breakfast.",
