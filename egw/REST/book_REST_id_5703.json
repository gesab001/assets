    "word": "When we reached Kansas City, we found that a place had been reserved for our company in a chair car. The change from one train to another was easily made, and the next day we reached Chicago, where we were met by brethren who accompanied us to Battle Creek. We can truly say that the journey across the plains was accomplished with as little inconvenience and weariness as we have ever experienced in the twenty-six times that we have passed over the road. The Lord blessed us, and we feel it a privilege to give him all the glory. At Battle Creek I was pleased to meet many old friends, and to find a few days of quiet and rest in the home of my son Edson.",
