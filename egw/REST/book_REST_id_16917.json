    "word": "Special meetings should also be held for those who are interested in the truth and who need instruction. To these meetings the people should be invited, and all, both believers and unbelievers, should have an opportunity to ask questions on points not fully understood. Give all an opportunity to speak of their difficulties for they will have them. In all the sermons and in all the Bible studies let the people see that on every point a plain \"Thus saith the Lord\" is given for the faith and doctrines which we hold.",
