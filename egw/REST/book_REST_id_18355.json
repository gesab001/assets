    "word": "John, you have been cultivating your fun and frolic-loving propensities. Have you grown in grace? Have you felt the great importance of daily educating the heart and mind to cultivate your higher, nobler faculties? You need to obtain more correct views of religion. You are impulsive, emotional, spasmodic in your religious service. Great caution needs to be exercised by you, else you will make great mistakes. You do not go to the bottom of things. You must not follow the bent of your own mind. You have hereditary tendencies \n                                                                           382\nnot the most favorable for the perfection of Christian character, and you may lose your soul unless you view the great matter of eternal interest in a different light. . . .",
