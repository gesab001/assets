    "word": "MR No. 1280 - The Work in Nashville, Including the Health Food Business; Spiritual Interests To Be Paramount\n\n     I have a question to ask of those who are engaged in the health food work in Nashville. You have put your energies into this work, and have planned to get means for it. Was it not your duty, before doing this, to use all your powers in an effort to put on a proper basis the work already started in Nashville? You have lost the opportunity of showing by a wise example how other places are to be worked. Money that should have been used to place on a firm foundation the work already begun in Nashville has been invested in an enterprise which should have received more consideration before being started.",
