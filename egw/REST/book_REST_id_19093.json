    "word": "The question \"What difference does it make what day we keep for the Sabbath,\" is often asked. Just the same as it did with Adam, it made every difference. Whether he should obey God and not eat of the tree of knowledge, or whether he should yield to Satan's specious reasoning and say \"What difference does it make whether I eat of the fruit of this forbidden tree or the rest of the trees in the garden?\" Adam's sin in doing the very things the Lord told him not to do was disobedience and transgression and opened the flood-gates of woe to our world. The life of Christ is to be carefully meditated upon, and to be constantly studied with a desire to understand the reason why He had to come at all. We can only form our conclusions by searching the Scriptures as Christ has enjoined upon us to do for He says, \"They testify of me.\" We may find by searching the Word the virtues of obedience in contrast with the sinfulness of disobedience. \"As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.\"",
