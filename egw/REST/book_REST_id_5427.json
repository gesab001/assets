    "word": "ONE WITH THE RACE HE HAS REDEEMED.\u2014\u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son.\u201d He gave Him not only to live among men, to bear their sins, and die their sacrifice. He gave Him to the fallen race. Christ was to identify Himself with the interests and needs of humanity. He who was one with God has linked Himself with the children of men by ties that are never to be broken. Jesus is \u201cnot ashamed to call them brethren\u201d (Hebrews 2:11); He is our Sacrifice, our Advocate, our Brother, bearing our human form before the Father\u2019s throne, and through eternal ages one with the race He has redeemed\u2014the Son of man. And all this that man might be uplifted from the ruin and degradation of sin that he might reflect the love of God and share the joy of holiness.\u2014SC 14.",
