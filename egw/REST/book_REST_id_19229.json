    "word": "MR No. 479 - Anna and Nathaniel White\n\n     When we returned from the West we found that Anna had greatly changed. Consumption has marked her for his victim, and to all human appearance in a few months she will be laid by Nathaniel's side. We have had a serious time. I found Clarissa and Anna could not eat, had no appetite, and our family did not understand providing for the sick, and the conference brought so much labor upon the family they had all they could do and I was obliged to keep on my feet day after day to wait upon the sick until my feet at night would be blistered and it was impossible for me to rest I was so exhausted. . . . Anna and Clarissa have been very, very sick, the power of the enemy was broken upon Clarissa about two weeks since, yet her chills continued until yesterday. She and Anna have been unable to labor at all. My sewing has laid almost entirely still.--Letter 8, 1853, p. 1. (To Brother and Sister John Loughborough, circa September 7, 1853.)",
