    "word": "Though stormy times are before us, much missionary work still remains to be done in the cities. This work can be done better now than at any other time in the future. But this does not require the establishment of large business enterprises. Let us not move according to human ambition. We are living in too solemn a time to move impulsively. While missionary work is to be done in the cities and out of the cities, God does not desire His people to invest their means in large commercial interests in the cities. My brethren and sisters, if you have physical force, if you have money, invest them in the work of enlightening men and women, warning them to prepare for what is coming upon the earth.--Ms 76, 1905. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 4, 1988. Entire Ms.",
