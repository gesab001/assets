    "word": "I gave my life to Him when I was eleven years old. I remember the experience of that little girl was enacted in my life. I picked up a little piece of paper in the road; that paper said that a man was going to preach that the Lord was coming. I was so afraid that He would come before I was ready. I wrestled with God, and He gave me His blessing, and He gave me peace. I went to my young companions; I told them, I pled with them. I got them to bow with me before God in prayer. I was possessed of a hasty temper. I began to pray for the Lord to help me overcome this. I began to wrestle in prayer for God's grace and blessing, and He gave it to me. When we have God's blessing with us, we can improve our powers, so that we can render back glory to God.--Ms. 20, 1888, pp. 12, 13, 16. (Sermon preached in Potterville, Mich., Nov. 25, 1888.) \n\n\n                                 -383-",
