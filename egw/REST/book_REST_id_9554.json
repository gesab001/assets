I wish I could talk with you both. I wish to ask you, Do you receive the two dollars a week that I arranged to have sent you by the Australian Union Conference?  Please tell me in regard to this. Brother Hindson says that generally the money has been placed to your credit on the Office books, and that you have sent to the Office orders for goods, which have been filled.  Would you prefer to have the money sent you?  If so, please let this be known, and it will be done.",
