    "word": "satan's slaves\n \n\n     On every side, Satan seeks to entice the youth into the path of perdition; and if he can once get their feet set in the way, he hurries them on in their downward course, leading them from one dissipation to another, until his victims lose their tenderness of conscience, and have no more the fear of God before their eyes. They exercise less and less self-restraint. They become addicted to the use of wine and alcohol, tobacco and opium, [NOTE: THE SOURCE OF MORPHINE IS OPIUM. A FAST-WORKING DERIVATIVE OF MORPHINE IS HEROIN.] and go from one stage of debasement to another. They are slaves to appetite. Counsel which they once respected, they learn to despise. They put on swaggering airs, and boast of liberty when they are the slaves to selfishness, debased appetite, and licentiousness. [TEMPERANCE, P. 274.]",
