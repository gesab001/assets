December 11, 1891. \n\nElder Haskell Dear Brother:- \n     We have received your letters, and have read them with interest. This is the first chance we have had to respond. The Alameda leaves Sydney for America on December 20, and the mail will go at that time. Well, we are here in Sydney, and our long ocean journey is over. We tarried 19 hours in Honolulu, and I spoke in the evening in the Young Men's Christian Association Hall. Though our meeting was announced but a short time before it was held, we had a good congregation. After speaking I was introduced to the prominent members of the Young Men's Temperance Association, and they expressed much pleasure at the discourse which I gave. They said that they had listened with great interest, that many new ideas had been presented to them, opening broad fields of thought in regard to redemption and the love of God. They expressed regret that they could not have the privilege of hearing me speak frequently to them, and wished that I might remain with them for a couple of weeks, and often occupy their hall, assuring me that I should have a good congregation. I thank the Lord for the favorable impression made upon them.",
