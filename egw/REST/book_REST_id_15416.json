    "word": "The Lord loves you, my dear brother. He loves you. \"The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed\" (Isaiah 54:10). \"All things work together for good to them that love God\" (Romans 8:28). Could your eyes be opened, you would see your heavenly Father bending over you in love and could you hear His voice, it would be in tones of compassion to you who are prostrate with suffering and affliction. Stand fast in His strength; there is rest for you, the weary.--Letter 71, Dec. 5, 1878, to J. N. Andrews.",
