    "word": "The tender years of childhood are years of sacred responsibility to fathers and mothers. Parents have a sacred duty to \n\n\n                               -431- \n\nperform in teaching their children to help bear the burdens of the home, to be content with plain and simple, good and neat, and inexpensive dress. The requirements of the parent should always be reasonable; kindness should be expressed, not by foolish indulgence, but by wise direction. Parents are to teach their children pleasantly, without scolding or faultfinding, seeking to bind the hearts of the little ones to them by the silken cords of love. Let all, fathers, and mothers, teachers, older brothers and sisters, become an educating force to keep up every spiritual interest, and create a wholesome atmosphere in the home and school life that will train the younger children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.",
