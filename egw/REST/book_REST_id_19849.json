    "word": "June 8, 1874: We arrived at Omaha at two o'clock p.m. Here I rechecked my trunk. This was new to me. The day was oppressively hot, but we were at last all ready to go on our way. We traveled until twelve o'clock at night. We stepped off the car at Newton [Iowa], found Brother Hart waiting for me. We rode half a mile through the mud to the campground. We quietly entered Brother [G.I.] Butler's tent and I rested my weary body upon a hard straw bed with a straw pillow. It rained powerfully.--Ms. 4, 1874, p. 1. (Diary, June 4-8, 1874.)",
