Jones.) \n\n\n     As I have read the little pamphlet in regard to the investigation of the Review and Herald publishing work, I have determined not to demand or to receive any compensation for losses sustained through a wrong course of action in regard to royalties. I wish to bear a living testimony that I forgive everything. I may have to refer to the past in order to present things shown me to be correct principles, but I would not bring self into this work of restitution. If there is restitution to be made, let it be devoted wholly to God in building up that which Satan has thought to tear down.",
