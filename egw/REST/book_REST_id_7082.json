    "word": "The Physician Not Exempt \n\n     Often physicians are called upon on the Sabbath to minister to the sick, and it is impossible for them to take time for rest and devotion. The Saviour has shown us by His example that it is right to relieve suffering on this day; but physicians and nurses should do no unnecessary work. Ordinary treatment, and operations that can wait, should be deferred till the next day. Let the patients know that physicians must have one day for rest. The Lord says, \"Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations.\" Exodus 31:13.",
