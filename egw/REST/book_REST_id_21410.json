    "word": "He alone who proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection and the life,\" who is able when the last trump shall sound, to raise His saints from the grave and clothe them with immortality, giving them everlasting victory over death and the grave, is able now to keep the souls of all committed to His trust against that day, and to deliver them in their perplexities. He has invited them to come to Him, and He has promised to help them, whatever their extremity, and to give them peace and rest as they wear His yoke and learn of Him lessons of meekness and lowliness. He leaves not His heritage to the judgment of any man.",
