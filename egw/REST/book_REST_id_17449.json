    "word": "Christ makes the necessities of his children his own personal interest. He regards any slight or neglect of his brethren as a slight to himself, and a benefit conferred upon the humblest of them, as if it were conferred upon himself. He says, \"I was a hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in. . . . Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\"",
