    "word": "I Will Give You Rest.--The Lord has given me a message for you, and not for you only, but also for other faithful souls who are troubled by doubts and fears regarding their acceptance by the Lord Jesus Christ. His word to you is, \"Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine\" (Isaiah 43:1). You desire to please the Lord, and you can do this by believing His promises. He is waiting to take you into a harbor of gracious experience, and He bids you, \"Be still, and know that I am God\" (Psalm 46:10). You have had a time of unrest; but Jesus says to you, \"Come unto Me, . . . and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). The joy of Christ in the soul is worth everything. \"Then are they glad,\" because they are privileged to rest in the arms of everlasting love. --Lt 2, 1914 (TM 516.)",
