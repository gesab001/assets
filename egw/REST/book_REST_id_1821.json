    "word": "Chapter 49 \u2014The Christian Attitude Toward Want and Suffering\n\nToday God gives men opportunity to show whether they love their neighbor. He who truly loves God and his fellow man is he who shows mercy to the destitute, the suffering, the wounded, those who are ready to die. God calls upon every man to take up his neglected work, to seek to restore the moral image of the Creator in humanity.  WM 49522",
