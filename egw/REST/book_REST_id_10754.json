    "word": "After Christ had condescended to leave his high command, step down from an infinite height and assume humanity, he could have taken upon him any condition of humanity he might choose. But greatness and rank were nothing to him, and he selected the lowest and most humble walk of life. The place of his birth was Bethlehem, and on one side his parentage was poor, but God, the owner of the world, was his Father. No trace of luxury, ease, selfish gratification, or indulgence was brought into his life, which was a continual round of self-denial and self-sacrifice. In accordance with his humble birth, he had apparently no greatness or riches, in order that the humblest believer need not say that Christ never knew the stress of pinching poverty. Had he possessed the semblance of outward show, of riches, of grandeur, the poorest class of humanity would have shunned his society; therefore he chose the lowly condition of the far greater number of the people. The truth of heavenly origin was to be his theme: he was to sow the earth with truth; and he came in such a way as to be accessible to all, that the truth alone might make an impression upon human hearts.",
