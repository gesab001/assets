    "word": "Christ-filled Literature in SDA Restaurants.--Those who come to our restaurants should be supplied with reading matter. Leaflets treating on the lessons of Christ should be given them. The burden of supplying this reading matter should be shared by all our people. All who come \n\n348 \n\nshould be given something to read. It may be that many will leave the tract unread, but one among those in whose hands you place it may be searching for light. He will read and study what you give him, and then, perhaps, will pass it on to others.--Lt 157, 1902.",
