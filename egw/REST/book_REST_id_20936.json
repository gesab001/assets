    "word": "A few words more in regard to the location of our sanitariums. Never, never should these institutions be established in the cities. They should be established in the country, amidst pleasant surroundings and in connection with plenty of land. This is a positive necessity. Flower- and vegetable-gardens and orchards will be found to be health-giving agencies in the successful treatment of the sick. Many who come to our sanitariums to receive the benefit of these advantages will be blessed with improved health. So interested will they become in the work given them to do that they will forget their aches and pains.",
