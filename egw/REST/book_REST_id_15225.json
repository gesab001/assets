    "word": "O how gracious is our Lord! \"I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee\" (Hebrews 13:5). \"I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands\" (Isaiah 49:16). . . . \"I will not leave you comfortless\" (John 14:18). The Holy Spirit is to be given for the asking. Only think of it, He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than parents are to give good gifts unto their children. Then let us rejoice, let us be glad. Let us not look at the hellish work of the powers of darkness until hope and courage shall fail. Jesus lives, and we must let our faith pierce the blackness . . . and rest in the light, rejoice in the light of the Sun of Righteousness.",
