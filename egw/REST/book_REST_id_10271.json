    "word": "17 (2 Corinthians 8:21; 1 Peter 2:12). The Honest Are His Jewels Forever.--Truthfulness and frankness should be ever cherished by all who claim to be followers of Christ. God and the right should be the motto. Deal honestly and righteously in this present evil world. Some will be honest when they see that honesty will not endanger their worldly interests, but all who act from this principle will have their names blotted out of the book of life.",
