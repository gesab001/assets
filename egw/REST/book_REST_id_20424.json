    "word": "I saw the lack of government with their child. The mother and grandmother have indulged and sympathized with and excused the wrongs of the child until evil has strengthened with his strength.

He has not been restrained and subdued as he should have \n\n\n                               -332- \n\nbeen. This has at times called forth great severity from the father, on account of the indulgent course of the mother and grandmother. There has been a wrong all around, and the child has thought his father too severe, has despised parental authority, and been impatient of restraint. God has noticed these things. The boy's heart is fully set in him to do evil and to have his own way. Satan controls his mind.",
