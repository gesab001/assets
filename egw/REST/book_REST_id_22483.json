    "word": "Some who are supposed to be heart and soul devoted to God, are acting to him, and to his work disloyal. Others have placed confidence in them, but deception covers them as with a garment. Their minds are controlled by a restless, irrepressible energy and eagerness to disclose their sentiments where they dare venture. Thus seeds are sown everywhere. By a partially expressed sentiment they first cast doubt and unbelief of the truth. There are those who are not in harmony with the Testimonies because men in positions of trust are not in harmony with them; for the testimonies do not coincide with their opinions, but rebuke every vestige of selfishness and reprove wrong.",
