    "word": "This is the statement coming from the mouth of God through Jesus Christ. How then can ministers in their pulpits declare that the law was abolished at the cross? The fourth commandment is unchanged; the seventh day is God's memorial, testifying of His creative power in making the world in six days and resting on the seventh day. Every voice that shall be heard in the pulpits on Sunday testifying that the first day of the week is the Sabbath is echoing the words of the first great deceiver. In this teaching the ministers are giving themselves away, for where there is no law there is no transgression, no sin, and if no sin, there is no need of the gospel, no need of a Saviour.",
