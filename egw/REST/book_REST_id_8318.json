    "word": "Let us make an application of the words of Christ to our own individual cases. Are we poor, and blind, and wretched, and miserable?

The conflict is for us in these days of subtle temptation to worldliness, to self-security, to indulgence of pride, covetousness, false doctrines, and immorality of life.",
