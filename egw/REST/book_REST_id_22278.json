    "word": "It was thought that Solomon knew God. In a dream the Lord appeared unto Solomon, and said unto him: \"Ask what I shall give thee.\" And Solomon said: \"Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?\" And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom and riches and power and influence, and Solomon served the Lord for a time. At the dedication of the temple, Solomon prayed unto the Lord, and blessed the people, saying, \"Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require: that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God, and that there is none else.\"",
