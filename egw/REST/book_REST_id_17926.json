    "word": "I was shown that some are deceived in regard to themselves. They look to those who have much property, and feel that they are the only ones who are in special danger of covetousness, and who have a love of the world. This is not the case. Those who have means are constantly in danger, and are accountable for all the talents of means which the Master has entrusted to their care. But those who have little of this world are frequently self-caring, and do not do that which is in their power to do, and which God requires them to do. They have opportunities, frequently, of doing good if they were less self-caring; but they have so long cared for self, and studied self-interest, they think there is no other way for them to do.",
