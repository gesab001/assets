    "word": "In New York and in many other cities, there are multitudes of people unwarned. Among our people there is great zeal--and I do not say there is any too much--to work the foreign countries; but it would be more consistent if we could see a proportionate zeal to work the cities close by. We need to move sensibly. We need to plan to warn the cities in America. We must set about this work in earnestness, and do it. Laying aside our peculiarities and our own ideas, we are to preach Bible truth. Men of consecration and talent are to be sent into these cities and set to work. Oh, why are so many seemingly indifferent and self-centered? Why do so many take an interest chiefly in the place where they are laboring, and lose sight of the fact that there is a world to be warned, and that these cities must hear the message?",
