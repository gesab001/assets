    "word": "WE NEED TO WRESTLE WITHOD IN PRAYER.\u2014Will we carry forward the work in the Lord\u2019s way? Are we willing to be taught of God? Will we wrestle with God in prayer? Will we receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit? This is what we need and may have at this time. Then we shall go forth with a message from the Lord, and the light of truth will shine forth as a lamp that burneth, reaching to all parts of the world. If we will walk humbly with God, God will walk with us. Let us humble our souls, and we shall see of His salvation.\u2014(Review and Herald, July 1, 1909.)",
