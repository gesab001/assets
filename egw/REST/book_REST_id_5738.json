    "word": "Situation of Stockholm\n     Stockholm has been called the Venice of the North. Its situation, upon islands, on a plain, and on rocky hills surrounded by water and islands in every direction, is exceedingly picturesque. In one respect it is strikingly unlike most other cities; lying, as it does, in immediate proximity to primeval forests and rocky islands where there is hardly a trace of cultivation. There are few cities in Europe whose general aspect is more attractive than that of this northern capital.",
