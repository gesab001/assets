    "word": "A solemn responsibility rests upon parents to teach their children to work for all who are unconverted. They are never to be ashamed to use their hands in lifting home burdens, or their feet in running errands. While they are thus engaged, they will not run in paths of negligence and sin. How many hours are wasted by the children and youth which might be spent in carrying home burdens and thus showing a loving interest in father or mother. They might take upon their strong young shoulders the responsibilities which some one must bear.",
