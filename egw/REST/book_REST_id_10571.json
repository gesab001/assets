    "word": "When we receive Christ as an abiding guest in the soul, the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, will keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. The Saviour's life on earth, though lived in the midst of conflict, was a life of peace. While angry enemies were constantly pursuing Him, He said, \"He that sent me is with me; the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.\" No storm of human or satanic wrath could disturb the calm of that perfect communion with God. And He says to us: \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.\" \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest.\" Bear with Me the yoke of service for the glory of God and the uplifting of humanity, and you will find the yoke easy, and the burden light. . . .",
