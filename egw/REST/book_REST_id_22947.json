    "word": "Sister White continued urging men in official positions to act, until, finally, she felt impelled to lead out herself, just (713) as she had formerly led out in advancing the interests of the Avondale School at a time when many were disheartened over the prospect of founding a training-school there. But, unlike their Australasian brethren, who, reluctantly at first, and enthusiastically after some years of trial, assumed their full share of the financial burden and the burden of control,-- unlike their Australasian brethren, the brethren in official responsibility in Southern California and in the Pacific Union Conference did not follow Sister White's leadings in this instance, and refused to take any financial responsibility what so ever. In fact, to this day, it is a matter of conjecture on the part of some who have been closely connected with the Paradise Valley enterprise, as to the real attitude that men in responsibility have taken, through the years, toward the plain instruction that came to them through Sister White to give serious consideration to the advantages that would be gained by securing possession of the Paradise Valley property.",
