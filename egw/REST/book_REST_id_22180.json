    "word": "Your letter is now answered. I will answer Jones' letter today. I have written Brother Church, as Brother Saunders requested. I have written to Burrough Valley urging that a buyer be found for my place. Brother Hagar told me when I was in Oakland that he was making every effort to sell his property in Oakland and then he would buy the land I had in Burrough Valley. I received the letter from Adams of Oakland but do not understand what he means, whether it is the little house in Oakland I sold to A. T. Jones or the whole property. I think he means simply the house I sold. In that case I think there will be nothing particular coming to Mrs. Scott as the interest must have overreached the amount she paid for the property. You can reckon unpaid interest on the property for five or six years.",
