    "word": "Near Laramie, Wyoming, August 15, 1883--Dear Children: We have had another good night's rest. We are near Laramie. The journey thus far has been the most pleasant of any we have had in crossing the plains. In the last car the seat opposite us was occupied by only one man. We used it a good share of the time. Yesterday we changed at Ogden and there was no one in the opposite section. We had the entire command of our own section and the one opposite us, so we have not been crowded at all. We have an excellent sleeping-car conductor and on both trains good accommodating porters.",
