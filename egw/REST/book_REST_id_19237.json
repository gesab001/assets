    "word": "\"Both [are] in good condition, especially [the] horse who \n     exhibited his balky propensities yesterday morning before Mary \n     Clough. He was disposed to go every way but the one he should go. \n     Willie will sell him for what he can get. The Tribune men have used \n     him to carry their forms back and forth; paid three dollars each \n\n\n                                    -280- \n\n\n     week. He has been used in drawing lumber and for different \n     purposes, so that he has paid his way. But I am going to watch for \n     an opportunity and interest others to get me a good team not so \n     very expensive, but manageable, that Mary and I can use to ride out \n     where and when we please.\"--Letter 4a, 1876.",
