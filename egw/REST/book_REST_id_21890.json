    "word": "Students, never rest satisfied with a low standard. In attending school be sure that you have in view a noble, holy object. Go because you desire to fit yourselves for service in some portion of the Master's vineyard. Do all that you can to attain this object. You can do more for yourselves than anyone else can do for you. And if you do all that you can for yourselves, what a burden you will lift from the principal and the teachers!",
