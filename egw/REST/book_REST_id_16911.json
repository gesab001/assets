    "word": "Many who come to the meeting are weary and heavy laden with sin. They do not feel satisfied with their religious experience. Opportunity should be given that those who are troubled and want rest in spirit may find help. After a discourse those who wish to follow Christ should be invited to signify their desire. Invite all who are not satisfied that they are prepared for Christ's coming, and all who feel burdened and heavy ladened to come apart by themselves. Let those who are spiritual converse with these souls. Pray for them and with them. Let much time be spent in prayer and close searching of the word. Let all obtain the real facts of faith in their own souls through belief that the Holy Spirit will be imparted to them because they have a real hungering and thirsting after righteousness. Teach them how to surrender themselves to God, how to believe, how to claim the promises. Let the deep love of God be expressed, in words of encouragement, in words of intercession.",
