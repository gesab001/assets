    "word": "MR No. 907 - Ellen G. White Letters To J. H. Kellogg\n\n     God Is Testing You; Keep Your Eyes Fixed on Jesus--Jesus loves you. The experience which you are having makes me glad, not because you are a sufferer, but because this is evidence to me that the Lord is testing and proving you to see if you will come to Him, to see if you will put your trust in Him, if you will find peace and rest in His love. I am praying for you, that Jesus will teach you precious lessons in coming to Him, the fountain of living waters. This is the experience every one of us must have if we ever dwell with Jesus in the mansions He has gone to prepare for us. You have lessons of the highest value to learn in the school of Christ, lessons that will lead you to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.",
