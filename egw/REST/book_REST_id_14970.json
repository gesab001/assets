    "word": "Let the workers in our restaurants secure tracts and papers filled with the precious messages of warning, and pure spiritual food. Place these in the hands of those who come to eat at the tables. It is your duty to keep before the people with whom you are brought in contact, the fact that God rules and reigns, and that the study of His words is important. Every action is passing in review before God.",
