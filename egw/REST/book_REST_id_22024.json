    "word": "No one should lean wholly upon another's mind; but as God's free agents, each should ask wisdom of Him. When the learner depends in a large degree upon another man's thoughts, and goes no farther than to accept his plans, he sees only through that man's eyes, and is so far only an echo of the other. God will, by His own Spirit, work directly through the mind he has put in man, if the man will only give him a chance to work, and will recognize his dealings with him. God designs that men shall use their minds and consciences for themselves. He never designed that one man should become the shadow of another, and utter only another's sentiments. But this error has been coming in among us, that a very few are to be mind, conscience, and judgment for all God's workers. The foundation of christianity is \"Christ our Righteousness.\" Men are individually responsible to God and must act as God acts upon them, not as another human mind acts upon their mind; for if this method of indirect influence is kept up, souls can not be impressed and directed by the great I AM. They will, on the other hand, have their experience blended with another, and will be kept under a moral restraint, which allows no freedom of action or of choice.",
