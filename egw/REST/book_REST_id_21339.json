    "word": "MR No. 1532 - The Need for Faith, Love, and Christlikeness\n\n     (Written July 19, 1899, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, N.S.W., to Mrs. S. M. I. Henry.) \n\n\n     I have been very sick for one week during our conference. I am now improving. I was able Monday to sit in a carriage and ride very slowly to the school grounds, and meet with a large company in the school chapel. I commenced to talk in great weakness, but my voice became stronger. I was unable to stand, and was accommodated with an easy chair on the platform. My address was, \"The Sanitarium, Our Great Necessity,\" and presenting the features of what should be in the building to be erected. I will send the talk to you. The speaking did me no harm. We are all interested, and all can do something, but we cannot anyone create large donations, All must do their best.",
