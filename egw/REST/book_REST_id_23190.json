    "word": "About ten rods away, on what is known as Summit Hill, there is a group of fine cottages. The central cottage has nine beautiful rooms and two bathrooms. In the basement is the heating plant for the five cottages. Prettily grouped around this large cottage are four small ones, having four rooms each, with bath and toilet. An interesting feature of these cottages is that each room has its verandah, with broad windows running to the floor, so that the beds can be wheeled right out on to the verandah, and the patients can sleep in the open air.",
