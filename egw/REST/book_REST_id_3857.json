    "word": "Preparing for Future Duties.--When a laborer has been under a heavy pressure of care and anxiety, and is overworked in both body and mind, he should turn aside and rest a while, not for selfish gratification, but that he may be better prepared for future duties. \n                                                                           660\nWe have a vigilant foe, who is ever on our track, ready to take advantage of every weakness that would help to make his temptations effective. When the mind is overstrained and the body enfeebled, he presses upon the soul his fiercest temptations. Let the laborer carefully husband his strength, and when wearied with toil, let him turn aside and commune with Jesus.-- Gospel Workers, p. 245. (1915)",
