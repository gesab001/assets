    "word": "The work of expending means required a man who had not so many and so varied responsibilities as were resting upon Edson White. He should sit with the leading men in counsel; for he has been chosen and accepted by God to do a work in the Southern field; but he should have given the financial management of affairs into the hands of a man wise in management, who had not so many burdens resting upon him.
