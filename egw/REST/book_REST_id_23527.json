    "word": "Much of that which is revealed is dark to human minds, because the jewels of truth are not searched for as for hidden treasure. The truth lies hidden beneath the rubbish of human systems, human wisdom and philosophy. Infinite, eternal truth, the revelation of God, is explained in the light of human conjectures. God's Word, they assert, is modified, remodeled to suit the changing times, to suit their own mind and ideas. They have been educated from wrong books, and have left a plain \"Thus saith the Lord\" which involves eternal interests, to adjust itself. Spiritual things can only be discerned by the Holy Spirit's power.",
