    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 18, 1892. I had a very trying night. I was very weary, but was unable to rest because my body was full of pain. I longed for the morning, so that I might sit up. In these trying times I look to Jesus, for I know that He is touched with the feeling of my infirmities. In His humanity He was made perfect through suffering. He knows just what we need, just what we can bear, and He will give us grace to endure every trial and test that He brings upon us.",
