    "word": "Dr. Kellogg and Bro. Henry Kellogg represent two very important institutions. Neither of these men can well be spared from his position of trust, yet neither of them should feel that he is indispensable. God could do without them, but they cannot do without God. I was shown that these brethren were not working in harmony. If Bro. Henry Kellogg fills his position honorably, he must guard the financial interests of the institution committed to his care. Dr. Kellogg feels the same responsibility in his position of trust. But these men should be exceedingly cautious that they look not alone on their own branch of the work, and labor for their own department, to the injury of other branches, of equal importance.",
