    "word": "We may expect, from the history that is given us of Daniel, that God would work for us as He did for Daniel. Daniel purposed in his mind that he would not comply with any condition that would in any way weaken his physical powers so that he could not give glory to God. Now if he had yielded to that very first test--to have eaten at the king's table--then he would have yielded to the second test. Had he said, \"It is a very small matter whether I pray in secret or whether I pray openly to God and it is convenient for me to obey the command,\" then the Lord could not have let His blessing rest upon him in such a remarkable degree. But here is wherein Daniel saw God could be honored; that he, as a representative of God, must keep the living God exalted above all as the One who could give wisdom and power. Here was an opportunity for him to show to all from whence came his strength, and that man could not come in between him and his God; therefore he did not accommodate himself to the circumstances at all, but he placed himself in the position that he would lose his life rather than dishonor the God of heaven in any way. And we see that God honored Daniel with wisdom and understanding more than all the astrologers and magicians that were in the king's palace. And notwithstanding a gaping lion's den was open before him, yet he would repair to his tent and worship God there.",
