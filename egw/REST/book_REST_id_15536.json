When the rulers saw what they were doing, they hastened to acquaint Moses of this apparent violation of his directions; but his answer was \u201cThis is that which the Lord hath said, To-morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which ye will bake to-day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\u201d They did so, and found that it remained unchanged.

Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.\u201d",
