    "word": "Human Philosophy Versus Divine \n                     Revelation \n\n\n     Human philosophy declares that an indefinite period of time was taken in the creation of the world. Does God state the matter thus? No; He says, \"It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever: for in six days [not six indefinite periods of time; for then there would be no possible way for man to observe the day specified in the fourth commandment] the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.\" Please read carefully the fifth chapter of Deuteronomy. God says again, \"Remember [do not forget] the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. . . . For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\"",
