    "word": "Children should share the burdens with father and mother. \n\n\n     \"The approval of God rests with loving assurance upon the children who cheerfully take their part in the duties of domestic life, \n                                                                           18\nsharing the burdens of father and mother. They will be rewarded with health of body and peace of mind; and they will enjoy the pleasure of seeing their parents take their share of social enjoyment and healthful recreation, thus prolonging their lives. Children trained to the practical duties of life, will go out from the home to be useful members of society. Their education is far superior to that gained by close confinement in the schoolroom at an early age, when neither the mind nor the body is strong enough to endure the strain.\"-- Sp. T. on Ed., p. 41.",
