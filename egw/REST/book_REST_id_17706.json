    "word": "God made the world in six literal days, and on the seventh literal day he rested from all his work which he had done, and was refreshed. So he has given man six days in which to labor. But he sanctified the day of his rest, and gave it to man to be kept, free from all secular labor. By thus setting apart the Sabbath, God gave the world a memorial. He did not set apart one day and any day in seven, but one particular day, the seventh day. And by observing the Sabbath, we show that we recognize God as the living God, the creator of heaven and earth.",
