    "word": "Said the angel, \"Think ye that the Father yielded up his dearly beloved Son without a struggle? No, no.\" It was even a struggle with the God of heaven whether to let guilty man perish, or to give his darling Son to die for them. Angels were so interested for man's salvation that there could be found among them those who would yield their glory and give their life for perishing man. But, said my accompanying angel, \"That would avail nothing.\" The transgression was so great that an angel's life would not pay the debt. Nothing but the death and intercessions of his Son would pay the debt, and save lost man from hopeless sorrow and misery.",
