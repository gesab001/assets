    "word": "The Lord requires every teacher to become acquainted with the individuals who listen to his discourses and become interested in the truth. Speak a word in season, and pray for those who are in need of help and light. This personal effort must not be neglected. Your own souls will be benefited by it, and those for whom you labor will be blessed. The nature of your religious experience will be determined by your increasing acquaintance with divine things. Habitual communion with God is positively essential that you may maintain the even tenor of your way. Growth in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ will give you increased power for good. You will have wisdom from above. You will not manifest your own spirit, and, by cheap words, mingle the common fire with the sacred. God has made provision that his workers should be living epistles, known and read of all men. \n\n\n                       - 13 -",
