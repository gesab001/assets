    "word": "437. Let no meat be found at our restaurants or dining tents, but let its place be supplied with fruits, grains, and vegetables. We must practise what we preach. When sitting at a table where meat is provided, we should not make a raid on those who use it, but should let it alone ourselves; and when asked the reason for doing this, we should kindly explain why we do not use it.-- U. T., March, 1896.",
