    "word": "The Lord gave him the truth, but he did not practice it. The universe of heaven said to the king of Babylon, \"Thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men\" [cf. Matthew 16:23]. The ways of men are opposed to the ways of God. The Lord Jesus gave lessons to His disciples to show to us all that it is through His grace alone that we shall be able to discern spiritual truths. \"If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you\" [John 14:15-17]. To us who believe have been committed the oracles of God. The books of Daniel and Revelation are \n\n\n                                 -66- \n\nfull of matter which concerns every one of us. We should study these books, and let the Lord God of Israel communicate truth to us, so that we may be able to communicate the truth to others who live in these last days. The Lord would have His people learn of Jesus. God forbid that those for whom He has wrought shall become highminded and be left to their own way as was the king of Babylon.",
