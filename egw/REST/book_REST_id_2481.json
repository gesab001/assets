    "word": "Restitution With Contrition \n\n     Wherever there has been any neglect on your part to give back to the Lord His own, repent with contrition of soul, and make restitution, lest His curse rest upon you. . . . When you have done what you can on your part, withholding nothing that belongs to your Maker, you may ask Him to provide means to send the message of truth to the world.--R. & H., Jan. 20, 1885.",
