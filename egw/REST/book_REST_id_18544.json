    "word": "The same thing is acted over in our day. Light is sent us from heaven. Will we reject or receive it? It is our privilege to gather up the rays of light, and the more we seek for it the more the light will increase. Could our eyes be opened we could see the adversary of souls scattering darkness. All heaven is interested in the children of men. Angels are watching us and are bearing tidings to heaven of our dangers, and they are constantly drawing us to Christ. Our safety is in taking hold of our duty and gathering up the rays of light.",
