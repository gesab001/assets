    "word": "Where such an effort is made as has been made in Los Angeles, let the members of the church clear the King's highway, and help with their means in the work being done. Let them show that they are in perfect harmony. Let them be on hand at the meetings, armed and equipped for service, ready to talk with anyone who may be interested. Let them pray and work for the lost sheep.--Review and Herald, Dec. 20, 1906.",
