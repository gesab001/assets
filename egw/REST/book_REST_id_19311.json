    "word": "If I could see you, I would have words to speak that might be more acceptable than these traced with my pen. Christ comes as a Comforter to all who believe. He invites your confidence. He says, \"Abide in me.\" Surely we may trust in our loving Saviour. You can say, \"Yes, my Saviour, in Thee I can \n\n\n                                    -58- \n\nand will trust. I will abide in Thee.\" Then how trustfully you can work in His presence. Your works will be but the fruit of Christ working in you. You may rest in what Christ can do for you. And the energies of your soul will be awakened to cooperate with Him. He will work in you to do His good pleasure.",
