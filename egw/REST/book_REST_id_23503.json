    "word": "The student should place himself in school, if he can through his own exertions pay his way as he goes. He should study one year, and then work for himself the problem of what constitutes true education. There is no dividing line. \"Whether ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\" The learning heaped up by years of continued study is deleterious to the spiritual interests. Let teachers be prepared to give good counsel to the students who shall enter the schools. Let them not advise students to give years of study to books. Let them learn, and then give to others that which they have received and appreciated. Let the student set himself to work at manual labor, thus acquiring an education that will enable him to come out with solid principles, an all-round man. \n                                      (Signed) E. G. White \n\n\"Sunnyside\", Cooranbong, N. S. W., July 22, 1897.",
