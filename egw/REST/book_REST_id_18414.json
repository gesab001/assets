    "word": "Moss, Norway, [Sabbath] June 11, 1887. Passed a restless night. Great weakness seems to be upon me. By request I spoke to the Sabbath school, interpreted by Brother Olsen. It is pleasant to see so goodly a number  represented in the Sabbath school. All the children look bright and interested. Brother Matteson preached in the forenoon to a good audience.",
