    "word": "In the early days of the first angel's message, one poor man that was foolish was impressed with the truth, and he went to a learned Elder and repeated the following words, \"Elder G_____, behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet Him.\" [Elder G_____ said] \"Give us your reasons, Brother,\" but he presented no reasons, and kept on repeating these words, instead of trying to give proof for the soon coming of the Lord, for he of himself was unable to give any reason. But he repeated the words, \"Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet Him.\" And the Spirit of God rested upon them, and Elder G_____ fell on his knees and confessed his pomp and pride before the Lord.",
