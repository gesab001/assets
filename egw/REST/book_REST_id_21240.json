    "word": "Much time and thought have been given to studying ways and means to make the Mt. Vernon institution succeed. Elder Underwood has not had clear discernment, and he has not seen what needed to be done in Ohio. He has planned, but the Lord has not planned with him. Because he could not prevail upon the brethren to invest their means in the Mt. Vernon Sanitarium, Brother Underwood has felt irritated and has spoken unadvisedly. The Lord had other interests to build up in Ohio besides the Mt. Vernon Sanitarium, but those things that should have come first have received the least attention.",
