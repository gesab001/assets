[EXTRACT FROM A \n                LETTER WRITTEN IN 1903.] \n\n\n     The work that the believers in Battle Creek can do is at their hand. Let them distribute our literature. Let them make the most of every opportunity offered them to arrest the attention of unbelievers. Let those who have been reproved for serving self rather than Christ arouse themselves, and zealously repent. Let them put literature into every hand that will receive it, and let no one say, \"Why do ye so?\" In different ways a warning message is to be borne to high and low. Let all put on the gospel armor, and stand firm for the truth.",
