    "word": "Attention to health is one of our most important duties. We owe this to ourselves, to society, and to God. Young men and young women are proverbially \n\n\n                                    -57- \n\ncareless in regard to their health. Hundreds die in early life, not because of a dispensation of Providence, but because of a dispensation of carelessness. Many girls go half clad in cold weather. Others choose to sit reading or writing when they should be taking physical exercise. God gave them organs for use. The living machinery is not to be allowed to rust from inaction. To keep all the powers of the body equally taxed will require self-restraint.",
