    "word": "Christ is the chief shepherd. He has intrusted the care of His flock to undershepherds. He requires these shepherds to have the same interest for His sheep which He has ever manifested, and to ever feel the responsibility of the charge He has intrusted to them. . . . If they imitate His self-denying example, the flock will prosper under their care. . . . They will be constantly laboring for the welfare of the flock (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, pp. 122-124). \n                                                                           197",
