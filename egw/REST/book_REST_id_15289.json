    "word": "The troubles of this present time are diversified in form, but Christ has passed over the ground, and we need not be in uncertainty. He has invited us, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). The promise is, \"I will be with him in trouble\" (Psalm 91:15).",
