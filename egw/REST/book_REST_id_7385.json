    "word": "The Influence of Reading. [SEE CHAPTER 13,  \"FOOD FOR THE MIND.\"]--Many youth are eager for books. They read anything that they can obtain. I appeal to the parents of such children to control their desire for reading. Do not permit upon your tables the magazines and newspapers in which are found love \n\n286 \n\nstories. Supply their place with books that will help the youth to put into their character building the very best material--the love and fear of God, the knowledge of Christ. Encourage your children to store the mind with valuable knowledge, to let that which is good occupy the soul and control its powers, leaving no place for low, debasing thoughts. Restrict the desire for reading matter that does not furnish good food for the mind. The money expended for story magazines may not seem much, but it is too much to spend for that which gives so much that is misleading and so little that is good in return.--CT 133 (1913).",
