    "word": "Whoever longs for honor and distinction will find that the standard of virtue and holiness, strictly, steadfastly, adhered to as revealed in the Word of God, will place him as a wise man among the most noble advisers and counselors; for God's Word will elevate a man. His Word, if obeyed, will \n\n\n                                    -287- \n\nsanctify and refine and ennoble the entire man. There will be no cheap timbers brought into the structure of character-building. The natural, inherited tendencies, if erratic, will be, by the obedient, corrected by the Word; they will not be cherished as virtues and imitated by learners who will, in their turn, educate others, thus transmitting and perpetuating faulty sentiments that should never see the light of day. We are to be impelled by pure, disinterested motives, having no prejudices or preferences to strengthen, no set notions or ideas that Christ has never taught. Truth sanctifies the hearer, the mind, the will, for they are, if obedient, partakers of the divine nature.",
