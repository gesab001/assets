    "word": "Daughter Mary, you write that you wrote my sister to send part of that dress goods to Lizzie Tenney. That is my husband's sister, not my twin sister whose name is Lizzie Bangs. You should have found out Mary Foss' address and then written to her for an answer, and not let the matter rest. I fear they have not gotten the box and may never get it. Do write again. --Letter 63, 1878. \n\nEllen G. White Washington, D.C. April 11, 1985, Entire Letter",
