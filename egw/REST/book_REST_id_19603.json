    "word": "What more shall I say to you? What can I say? I want you to be saved. I want you to stand perfect before God. But you must understand there is no excuse that will stand in your favor before God for the sorrow and the anxiety and discouragement you have brought upon the cause of God by your perverted course as though the carrying out of your plans were superior to every temporal or spiritual interest. Your course has been unchristian and you must see it thus before you will ever extricate yourself from the snare of Satan.--Letter 50, 1880. (To Chapin Harris, September 1880.)",
