    "word": "Restored to the tree of life in the long-lost Eden, the redeemed will \"grow up\" to the full stature of the race in its primeval glory. The last lingering traces of the curse of sin will be removed, and Christ's faithful ones will appear in \"the beauty of the Lord our God\" (Psalm 90:17), in mind and soul and body reflecting the perfect image of their Lord. Oh, wonderful redemption! long talked of, long hoped for, contemplated with eager anticipation, but never fully understood.",
