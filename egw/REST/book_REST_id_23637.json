    "word": "I am instructed to send words of warning to the workers at Nashville: Look to Jesus, and not to men. We must realize the nothingness of man's wisdom. Christ is saying to you personally: Your case is in my keeping. So long as you cooperate with Me, you are entirely safe. \n\n\n                               -293- \n\nYour comfort, your peace, lie not in human agencies or in the confederacies you may form. Those who are willing to wear my yoke and learn of me my meekness and lowliness, shall find rest, because they make me their trust, their dependence. \"Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?\" Your comfort and peace lie not in seeking for the mastery or in striving for selfish advantage.",
