    "word": "But when the Review containing the two articles from Elder Littlejohn came, my spirit was again in an agony. It seemed to be that I should die. I could not write. For days I could not do anything. A horror of great darkness came upon me. I was moved to the very earth at the thought that men in responsible places in the office are not to be trusted, that they have so little discernment as to allow such an article to be printed and immortalized, giving us as a people away into the enemies hands. My case was made a subject of prayer, and in the night seasons Jesus seemed close by my side. He said, \"Let me take your burden; you cannot bear it.\" I thought that the arm of Jesus encircled me and he bade me read. Isaiah 54, and repeated from the fourth to the eight verse. Then he said, \"Satan is seeking to destroy you; I am your restorer. Lay your burden upon me. I will give you rest.\" I was entirely relieved, but restoration comes slowly. My head and heart are still afflicted.",
