    "word": "You may have opportunity to speak to other churches. In improving these opportunities, remember the words of the Saviour, \"Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\" Do not arouse the malignity of the enemy by making denunciatory speeches. Thus you would close doors against the entrance of truth. Clear-cut messages are to be borne. But guard against arousing antagonism. Restrain all harsh expressions.",
