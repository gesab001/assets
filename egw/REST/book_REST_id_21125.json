    "word": "MR No. 1458 - N. D. Faulkhead's Conversion and Business Ability\n\n     (Written May 31, 1906, from Sanitarium, California, to Brother Salisbury and Elder Olsen.) \n\n\n     I am interested in all that concerns our publishing institutions. I was much surprised that Brother Faulkhead has discontinued work in the Echo Office. If it was best for him to disconnect from the office for a time, he should return to it later on. If he is again willing to unite his interests in the office and bear the responsibilities that he has borne, he will be of much value to the publishing house. Secure him if you can. He is of value and understands the management of finance well. Not one can fill his place. If he has made mistakes, and sees his mistakes, he is the better guarded to avoid dangers. Objections may be made, but are you sure that any new man who might attempt to fill his place would make no mistakes in the same line or in other lines?",
