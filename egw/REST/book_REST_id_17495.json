    "word": "\"As the work increases, the greater the necessity for thorough trust and dependence on God, and a thorough interest in, and devotion to, the work. Selfish interests should be laid aside. There should be much prayer, much meditation: for this is highly necessary for the success and prosperity of the work. A spirit of traffic should not be allowed in any one who is connected with the work in the office. If it is permitted, the work will be neglected and marred. Common things will be placed too much upon a level with sacred things.",
