    "word": "During the past few weeks you have been highly favored with opportunities for Bible study. None can realize how heavily the burden rested upon me when I saw the important work that must be speedily done in California. And when Brother S. N. Haskell and his wife, about this time, were looking first at one place and then at another, with a view of visiting several places before returning to Nashville, where they seemed to think they must labor again, I wrote to them, You have a message to bear in southern California and in other portions of California, and I beg of you to come West soon. I am so thankful that they came. Now that they are here, I greatly desire that their work shall not be impeded in any wise. I want that you should clear the King's highway. And do not be afraid of the converting power of God. Be not afraid of His truth coming into the formation of your own individual character. If this work should tear your character to pieces, it can bring it together in a wholeness that is sanctified. We greatly need to humble the soul before God and before Christ Jesus, and so relate ourselves toward our maker and toward one another, that we shall be brought into unity of action.",
