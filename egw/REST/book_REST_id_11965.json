    "word": "Angels were sent to aid the mighty angel from heaven, and I heard voices which seemed to sound everywhere, \"Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of\n399\n400\nher plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.\" Revelation 18:4, 5. This message seemed to be an addition to the third message, joining it as the midnight cry joined the second angel's message in 1844. The glory of God rested upon the patient, waiting saints, and they fearlessly gave the last solemn warning, proclaiming the fall of Babylon and calling upon God's people to come out of her, that they might escape her fearful doom.",
