    "word": "During the erection of this building, we were favored by God, for not for one day were the workmen hindered by rain. April 24 and 25 the dedicatory services were held. The auditorium was full, and the heavenly Guest was present. His blessing rested on the worshipers. We thank the Lord for \n\n\n                                    -361- \n\nthe precious privilege of presenting to Him a house in which His people can assemble to worship Him in spirit and truth and in the beauty of holiness. This house will stand as a living testimony, a memorial of the Sabbath given at Creation. After the Lord had spent six days in creating the world, He rested on the seventh, and was refreshed. Then He blessed the day on which He had rested; and while the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy, He gave it to man as a rest day, to be kept holy throughout all time.",
