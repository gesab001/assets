    "word": "Teachers do not make as earnest work as they should of the Sabbath school exercises; they should come close to the hearts of the scholars, by aptness, by sympathy, by patient and determined effort to interest every scholar in regard to the salvation of the soul. These exercises should become altogether what the Lord would have them,--seasons of deep conviction of sin, of heart reformation. If the right work is done, in a skillful, Christlike manner, souls will be convicted, and the inquiry will be, \"What shall I do to be saved?\"--TSS 12, 13.",
