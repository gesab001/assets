    "word": "We can not always be on our knees in prayer, but the way to the mercy-seat is always open. While engaged in active labor, we may ask for help; and we are promised by One who will not deceive us, \"Ye shall receive.\" The Christian can and will find time to pray. Daniel was a statesman; heavy responsibilities rested upon him; yet three times a day he sought God, and the Lord gave him the Holy Spirit. So today men may resort to the sacred pavilion of the Most High and feel the assurance of his promise, \"My people shall dwell in a peaceful habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.\"",
