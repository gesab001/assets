    "word": "In the mountains, Colorado, Wednesday, September 24, 1873. We were up right early to pack our things and pursue our journey. We had most beautiful scenery most of the way. Autumn's glory is seen in the variegated golden and scarlet trees interspersed among the dark evergreens. The towering mountains are all around us. Rough, rocky, barren peaks of mountains rise above mountaintops that are covered with evergreens. The scenery is awfully grand. We stopped at Grand River for dinner. We had some difficulty in finding a carriage road, but after some delay, and one on horseback searching carefully, we could pass on. We had a very rough road. We arrived at Grand Lake about five o'clock. Pitched our tent in a good dry spot and were tired enough to rest that night.",
