    "word": "With great skill and with painstaking effort, Dr. Kellogg and his associates have prepared a special line of health foods. Their chief motive has been to benefit humanity, and the blessing of God has rested upon their efforts. If they walk in the counsel of God, they will continue to advance; for God will give skill and understanding to those who seek Him unselfishly. In some respects improvements can be made in the health foods sent out from our factories. The Lord will teach His servants how to make food preparations that are more simple and less expensive. There are many whom God will teach in this line if they will walk in His counsel and in harmony with their brethren.",
