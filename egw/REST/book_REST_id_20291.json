    "word": "We went to considerable expense in digging a well on the sanitarium land. The diggers went down 90 feet, and found an abundant supply of soft, pure water. This water is pumped into a large tank placed on the highest elevation of the property, and from there carried all over the grounds. I was at the sanitarium when the well was being dug, and we were all intensely interested in the progress made by the diggers. One morning Brother Palmer \n\n\n                                   -257- \n\ncame to my room to tell me that the water was coming into the well in a stream as big as his arm. The next morning he told me that there was 15 feet of water in the well. So we knew that success was ours.",
