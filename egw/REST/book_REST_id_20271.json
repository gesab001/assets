    "word": "The present showing is sufficient to prove to all who have the true missionary spirit that the \"regular lines\" may prove a failure and a snare. God helping His people, the circle of kings who dared to take such great responsibilities shall never again exercise their unsanctified power in the so-called \"regular lines.\" Too much power has been invested in unrevived, unreformed human agencies. Let not selfishness and covetousness be allowed to outline the work which must be done now and in the future to fulfill the grand, noble commission which Christ has given to every disciple. He, our Lord and Master, has given us an example, in His life of self-sacrifice, of the way in which we must work to advance the kingdom of God. Christ says, \"Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart. Take My yoke upon you, and ye shall find rest to your souls.\" \n\n\n                                  -205-",
