    "word": "\"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). This is a prescription for the healing of all spiritual, mental, and physical ills. It is Christ's gift to those who seek Him in sincerity and truth. He is the Mighty Healer. Then comes another invitation. \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (verses 29, 30). Wearing Christ's yoke, and learning of Him the lesson of meekness and lowliness, we find rest in faith and confidence and trust. We find that Christ's yoke is easy and His burden light.",
