    "word": "JESUS RETURNS IN GLORY SURROUNDED BY A CLOUD OF ANGELS.\u2014With anthems of celestial melody the holy angels, a vast unnumbered throng, attend Him on His way. The firmament seems filled with radiant forms\u2014\u201cten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.\u201d No human pen can portray the scene; no mortal mind is adequate to conceive its splendor. . . .

His countenance outshines the dazzling brightness of the noonday sun. . . .",
