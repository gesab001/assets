    "word": "You speak of Brother Henry Kellogg's having a share in the Paradise Valley Sanitarium, the same as some others of us have. I have longed to propose this, but supposed that he had invested his money elsewhere. In all my connection with Brother Kellogg, I have ever found him kind, sympathetic, and tenderhearted. I should be much pleased to have him unite with us in this interest. I have the fullest confidence in him as being a wise counselor and adviser. I never found him putting his foot on the brakes through fear that advancement would require means. May the Lord bless him, is my prayer.",
