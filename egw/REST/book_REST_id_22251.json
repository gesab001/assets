    "word": "There are important interests at stake in Battle Creek, where so many of our institutions have been planted. As we were planning for the establishment of these institutions, how we prayed, and sought God day and night. Before the College was established here, my husband would say to me in the night season, \"What shall we do about establishing a school here? Let us get up and pray.\" Long before this, we used to pray about establishing the printing-office. Then it was the Sanitarium. Prayer was interwoven with our very life experience. Day by day our petitions ascended to heaven, and God heard us. Now let us continue to pray. If we needed to pray about the establishment of these institutions, how much more do we need to pray for God to keep them as guardians of the truth. They are not to lift up any false standard. They are not to be false signposts for the people. Wherever you are, pray that God will keep these institutions. If your united prayers ascend to heaven in their behalf, God will hear; and if the men who are there prove unfaithful, he will remove them, and will put others there who will be true to him. God is not at a loss for means. If men will only respond to his call, all will be well.",
