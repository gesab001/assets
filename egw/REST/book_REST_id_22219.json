    "word": "The canvasser need not be discouraged if he is called to encounter difficulties in his work; let him work in faith, and victory will be given. \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world.\" Whenever a book is presented that will expose error, Satan is close by the side of the one to whom it is offered, and urges reasons why it should not be accepted. But a divine agency is at work to influence minds in favor of the light. Ministering angels will oppose their power to that of Satan. And when through the influence of the Holy Spirit the truth is received into the mind and heart, it will have a transforming power upon the character.",
