    "word": "It is important that wise plans be laid for the care of the helpers in all our institutions, and especially for those employed in our restaurants.

They are not to be left to the mercy of haphazard circumstances, with no regular time for prayer and no time at all for Bible study. When left thus, they become heedless and careless, indifferent to eternal realities.",
