    "word": "Will these hearers before me hear to a purpose? A Paul may plant, an Apollos water, but God giveth the increase. Christ gives rest to all who receive Him by faith. You are not to conjure up a variety of objects that you must enter into in order to find rest, assurance, confidence. Just leave that work, which none of the wisest of the human family can do, and put your trust in One who has promised rest to your souls. Do just what He has told you to do, and be assured that God will do all that He has engaged to do.",
