    "word": "When you agree to wear Christ's yoke, when you heed the invitation, \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:29), you will cease to bind yokes on the necks of others. You will cease to find fault. You will no longer regard it as a virtue to differ from others. You will dwell on those points on which you can agree.",
