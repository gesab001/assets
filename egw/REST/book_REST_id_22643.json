    "word": "We want students to come to this school who will not disappoint their parents and friends, so that at the close of the term the humiliating fact will not have to be made known that a few who were heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, took the lead, and the leaven of their spirit so influenced others that many were leavened. We established this school that this disorderly, insubordinate element should be placed under discipline and under obedience to the word of God, that the students might know how to value and respect themselves and realize that they did not come to school to do as they pleased, but to place themselves under the yoke of restraint and obedience.",
