    "word": "Christ's words of compassion are spoken to His workers today just as surely as to His disciples. \"Come ye yourselves apart, . . . and rest awhile,\" He says to those who are worn and weary. It is not wise to be always under the strain of work and excitement, even in ministering to men's spiritual needs; for in this way personal piety is neglected, and the powers of mind and soul and body are overtaxed. Self-denial is required of the servants of Christ, and sacrifices must be made; but God would have all study the laws of health, and use reason when working for Him, that the life which He has given may be preserved.",
