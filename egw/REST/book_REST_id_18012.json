    "word": "It is in justice to the cause of God that I feel compelled to state that Bro. Gage's sickness was not the result of unwearied devotion to the interests of the Office. Imprudent exposure on a trip to Chicago, for his own pleasure, was the cause of his long, tedious, suffering sickness. God did not sustain him in leaving the work, when so many were absent who had filled important positions in the Office. At the very time when he should not have excused himself for an hour, he left his post of duty. And God did not sustain him. There was no period of rest for us however much we might need it. The Review, the Reformer, and Instructor, must be edited. Very many letters had been laid aside until we should return to examine them. Things were in a sad state at the Office. Everything needed to be set in order.",
