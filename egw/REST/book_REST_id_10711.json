    "word": "A most interesting and important history is given in Daniel 2. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, dreamed a dream which he could not bring to his remembrance when he awoke. \"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans,\" those whom he had exalted and upon whom he depended, and, relating the circumstances, demanded that they should tell him the dream. The wise men stood before the king in terror; for they had no ray of light in regard to his dream. They could only say, \"O king, live forever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.\" \"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses made a dunghill. But if ye will show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof.\" Still the wise men returned the same answer, \"Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.\" \n                                                                           10",
