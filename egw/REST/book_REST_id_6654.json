    "word": "\"Dost thou believe on the Son of God?\" You are just as dependent upon Christ for all that you receive as is the weakest, poorest, and humblest soul. \"Dost thou believe on the Son of God?\" A mere speculative belief amounts to nothing. Do you believe on the Son of God as your personal Saviour? Then if you believe with all your heart, God dwells in the soul, and the soul in God. You represent Jesus. Those who are in positions of trust are on test and trial, to see if they will be wise men in positions of trust, to reveal whether Christ is working in and through them, so that He can represent His character and express Himself in their words and actions toward His heritage, for whom He has given His own precious life. . . .",
