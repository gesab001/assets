    "word": "Thus it has been in the Office. God is not pleased. There is a harsh, dictatorial spirit. God sees it all. It is written in His book, and every action between man and man will appear just as it is. Christ identifies His interest with suffering humanity, and if a man, in his pride of spirit, in his lofty ideas of himself, bruises the soul of his fellow man, the Lord Jesus writes it as done to Himself. \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" Matthew 25:40. If you could every one see and realize the effect of those sharp, rasping words that hurt and discourage the soul, and could see Jesus wounded and bruised because of those words, you would have great carefulness. You would not dare to exhibit your defects and objectionable traits of character. You would obey the Word.",
