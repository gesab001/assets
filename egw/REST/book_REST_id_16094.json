    "word": "Chapter Nine - Types of Work in Neighborhood Evangelism\n\n     A Large Work Before Our Churches.--There is a work to be done by our churches that few have any idea of. . . . We shall have to give of our means to support laborers in the harvest field, and we shall rejoice in the sheaves gathered in. But while this is right, there is a work, as yet untouched, that must be done. The mission of Christ was to heal the sick, encourage the hopeless, bind up the brokenhearted. This work of restoration is to be carried on among the needy suffering ones of humanity.",
