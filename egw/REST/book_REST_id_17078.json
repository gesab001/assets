    "word": "My husband and myself should no longer bear the burdens in this cause; but we should never have cause to feel that we are supplanted by others, who, as the work increases, \n                                                                           35\nhave to come in to bear responsibilities. One should not in any case feel envious or suspicious of another; but all should work in harmony; they are a part of the great whole. Interested workers must be found, who will qualify themselves, by close connection with God, to be guardians and directors of our institutions. Those of God's servants who have borne the burden and heat of the day should be honored and highly esteemed for their work's sake. But the people should trust alone in the living God. The workers individually should rely upon God. My husband's voice should not absolutely control, independent of those placed as a committee to form the plans and execute them.",
