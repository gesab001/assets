    "word": "There is to be no violent or unnatural strain put upon the human machinery; for all the works are very delicate. And as the Lord has not placed before any the process of straining the lungs, would not physicians do well to use caution in dealing with these organs? There is such a thing as injuring the vital organs, when the human agent does not understand how or when. It will not be for the credit of your students to run any risks. Periods of rest should be given to every student. They should have a change from continual study to hard physical work. Physical exercise, combined with a student life, is good.--Letter 102, 1898.",
