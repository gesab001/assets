    "word": "This is what we need in our households. There is in it no fault-finding, no harshness; but peace, and joy, and rest in the Lord. . . . God calls for loving service. He calls upon parents to speak lovingly and tenderly to their children. Let them see that you think they help you. Give them responsibilities to bear, small ones at first, and larger ones as they grow older. Never, never, let them hear you say of them, \"They hinder me more than they help me.\". . .",
