    "word": "I say, Put your trust in God. Your mind has been perplexed and occupied with this matter regarding your wife. Now in the name of Jesus lay this matter down; leave your case with the Lord. Let your experience humble you. Christ is with the weak and the tempted and forsaken to give them His divine sympathy and rest. You need rest of mind. Give up R, and fasten your affections on God. He will give you relief. Time is short; you have no time to stop and pity yourself. Go to work for the Master. Do your duty to the very best of your ability. Do not give up to discouragement; walk humbly with God; seek communion with God. Do not let your disappointment make you self-centered--to think of yourself, talk of yourself.",
