    "word": "The Promise Sure \n\n     Long have we waited for our Saviour's return. But none the less sure is the promise. Soon we shall be in \n                                                                           350\nour promised home. There Jesus will lead us beside the living stream flowing from the throne of God, and will explain to us the dark providences through which He led us in order to perfect our characters. There we shall see on every hand the beautiful trees of Paradise, in the midst of them the tree of life. There we shall behold with undimmed vision the beauties of Eden restored. There we shall cast at the feet of our Redeemer the crowns that He has placed on our heads, and, touching our golden harps, we shall offer praise and thanksgiving to Him that sitteth on the throne.-- R. & H., Sept. 3, 1903.",
