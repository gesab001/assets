    "word": "In giving us his word, God has put us in possession of every truth essential for our salvation. The storehouse of the unsearchable riches of Christ is open to heart and mind. Thousands of men and women have drawn water from the wells of salvation, yet there is no diminishing of the supply. Thousands have set the Lord before them, and by beholding been changed into the same image. Their spirit burns within them as they speak of his character, telling what Jesus is to them and what they are to Jesus. But these men have not exhausted the grand and holy themes. Thousands more may engage in the work of searching out the mysteries of salvation. The life of Christ and the character of his mission may be dwelt upon, and rays of light will shine forth more distinctly at every attempt to discover truth. Each fresh search will reveal something more deeply interesting than has yet been unfolded. The subject is inexhaustible. The study of the incarnation of Christ, his atoning sacrifice and mediatorial work, will employ the mind of the diligent student as long as time shall last, and looking to heaven with its unnumbered years, he will exclaim, \"Great is the mystery of godliness.\"",
