    "word": "Study of the Sciences Not to Be Neglected.--Far more might be accomplished in the work of self-education if we were awake to our own opportunities and privileges. True education means more than the colleges can give. While the study of the sciences is not to be neglected, there is a higher training to be obtained through a vital connection with God. Let every student take his Bible and place himself in communion with the Great Teacher. Let the mind be trained and disciplined to wrestle with hard problems in the search for divine truth.--COL 334 (1900).",
