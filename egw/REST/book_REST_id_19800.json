    "word": "We need to consider carefully our own spiritual interest. If we are abiding in Christ we shall not allow ambitious business transactions, even in our service for Him, to come before the spiritual fragrance that should characterize our association with our brethren, so that the crude elements in our characters shall break forth into action. In all the mechanical business our hands and minds shall undertake, let us be sure that we represent Christ's kindness, His long forbearance, His compassion, His goodness and love.",
