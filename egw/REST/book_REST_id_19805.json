    "word": "Are we striving most earnestly to obey these words? Shall we not eat and practice them? Shall we not draw nigh to God, fearing to sin against Him by being unjust to our brethren? Then we shall fear to offend His children. We will not wound or bruise His heritage. If we hope in His mercy for sinners, we shall manifest the most tender interest for all for whom \n\n\n                                  -51- \n\nChrist has died. We shall not, because our ideas are not exalted and honored as we think they should be, handle the reputation of our brethren in a way that offends God, who loves them as He loves us, and who takes as much pleasure in them as He does in us.--Manuscript 157, 1897, pp. 3-7.
