    "word": "After the last General Conference, there was presented before me the necessity of our establishing a sanitarium at Washington city. The interest of the mammoth institution at Battle Creek will require Dr. Kellogg's attention and labors there, and our brethren at Washington have been instructed to establish in their city a sanitarium, which shall not stand as a rival of any similar institution, but which shall be another agency for holding aloft the standard of health reform. Our people are not to be dependent upon the counsels of their fellow workers in Battle Creek regarding the management of the institution in Washington. And the Lord desires, too, that our sanitariums already in running order shall not depend so much upon the medical association at Battle Creek.",
