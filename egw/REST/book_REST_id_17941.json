    "word": "Each should diligently and interestedly attend to his own work, and leave others to their own Master, to stand or fall. There are too many busybodies in Monterey-- too many interested in watching their brethren, and for this reason they are constantly weak.

These poor souls do not know their own duty, and yet they take the responsibility to enlighten others in regard to their duty. If such would attend to their own work, and obtain the grace of God in their hearts, there would be a power in the church which is now lacking.",
