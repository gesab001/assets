    "word": "2 T.--60 \n     The light has been shining upon your pathway in regard to health reform, and the duty resting upon God's people in these last days to exercise temperance in all things. You, I saw, were among the number who would be backward to see the light, and correct your manner of eating, and drinking and working. As the light of truth is received and followed out, it will work an entire reformation in the life and character of all those who are sanctified through it.",
