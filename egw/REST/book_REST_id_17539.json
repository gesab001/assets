    "word": "One of authority arose, and said: \"These matters are not being presented in righteousness and truth. The very ones who should have taken a Christlike interest in the Southern work have passed it by. Wrong impressions have been made on minds in regard to the work at Nashville, and these impressions will work as leaven among meal, preventing the suffering Southern field from receiving the help that it needs. Your representations have been false, your criticisms cruel. Your words have been as sharp arrows. How much glory will they bring to God? You are endeavoring to bring in plans and theories that will greatly retard the work. Let no more such hindrances be brought in. All difficulties are easily settled, all wrongs easily righted, when human beings are under the control of the Spirit of God.",
