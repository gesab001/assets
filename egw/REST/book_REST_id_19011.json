    "word": "I am greatly distressed because that while there are so few preachers, there are still fewer ministers. After the sermons are preached the minister has a work to do in visiting those who have been impressed with the truth, and the work of God is greatly hindered when the expositor of Bible truth does not follow up the interest as a wise master-builder, making the most of his opportunity to press home upon the understanding and the conscience the truth which he has presented to the people. He must be a laborer together \n\n\n                                   -69- \n\nwith God, a zealous, interested worker, visiting those who have heard his expositions of truth. . . .",
