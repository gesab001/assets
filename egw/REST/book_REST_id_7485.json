    "word": "The Fruitage of Each Outburst of Anger.--One class have come up without self-control; they have not bridled the temper or the tongue; and some of these claim to be Christ's followers, but they are not. Jesus has set them no such example.... They are unreasonable and not easily \n\n520 \n\npersuaded or convinced. They are not sane; Satan for the time has full control. Every one of these exhibitions of wrath weakens the nervous system and the moral powers and makes it difficult to restrain anger on another provocation.--YI, Nov 10, 1886. (SD 142.)",
