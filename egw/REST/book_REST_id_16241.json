    "word": "Christ desires all to become His students. He says, Yield yourselves to My training; submit your souls unto Me. I will not extinguish you, but will work out for you such a character that you shall be transferred from the lower school to the higher grade. Submit all things to Me. Let My life, My patience, My longsuffering, My forbearance, My meekness, My lowliness, be worked out in your character, as one that abides in Me. . . . Then you have the promise not only \"I will give,\" but \"Ye shall find rest unto your souls.\"--Bible Training School, Aug. 1, 1903.",
