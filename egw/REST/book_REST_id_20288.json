    "word": "Elder Simpson closed his second series of tent meetings in Los Angeles when we were there a few weeks ago. But the people were not willing to let this teacher of the gospel leave them, and he received a petition signed by a great many, urging that he hold another series of meetings. The question as to whether he will do this is now under consideration. Meanwhile he must take a rest for a few weeks. The Lord will let light shine upon his path, to show him what to do next.",
