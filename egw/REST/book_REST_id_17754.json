    "word": "From the light God has given me, our brethren must get together and consider these things. The camp-meetings lose two thirds of their efficiency and success because the people, after so many discourses have been given, do not have anything clear in their minds; it is a commingling of ideas. There should be more time devoted to the spiritual seeking of God. And there should be a personal effort with each one on the ground. After the meetings are through, there should be a personal investigation with each one on the ground. Each one should be asked how he is going to take these things; if he is going to make a personal application of them. And then you should watch to see if there is an interest in this one and that. Five words spoken to them privately will do more good than the whole discourse has done. But you can do more than that; you can show love and kindness and courtesy; and in doing that you remove prejudice.",
