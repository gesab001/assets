    "word": "The people of God generally feel a united interest in the spread of the truth. They cheerfully contribute to give to those who labor in word and doctrine a liberal support. And I saw that it was the duty of those who have the responsibility of distributing means, to see that the liberalities of the church are not squandered. Some of these liberal brethren have been laboring for years with shattered nerves and broken down constitutions, caused through excessive hard labor in the past to obtain possessions here, and now as they freely give a portion of their substance, which has cost them so much, it is the duty of those who labor in word and doctrine to manifest, at least, a corresponding zeal and self-sacrifice equal to that shown by these brethren.",
