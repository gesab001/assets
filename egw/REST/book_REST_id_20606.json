    "word": "On Sunday afternoon, I spoke to a large and intelligent audience. Many of those present were outsiders. My strength was renewed, and I was able to stand without help before the people. The Lord's blessing rested upon me, and increased strength came to me as I spoke. As on Sabbath, those seeking spiritual help were invited to come forward, and we were glad to see the ready response. I united with Elder Corliss in prayer, and the blessing of the Lord came to me in a special manner. I felt so greatly strengthened that after the meeting I walked to the place where I was staying, a distance of five blocks.",
