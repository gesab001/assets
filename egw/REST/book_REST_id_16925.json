    "word": "Some students while learning from Dr. Kellogg will give promise of success; but after they have had their education at a medical college, they are not willing to learn. They feel so self-sufficient that they are spoiled. They have not experience, but are willing to do the higher kinds of work, and leave the lower rounds of the ladder without climbing. It were better that the Sanitarium should be closed up rather than to have it disgraced with inefficient practitioners. One thing is certain, the Doctor must have help; and although that help may not be in every respect as he could wish he, must let a share of the burdens that have rested on him be laid upon others. He cannot stand under the burdens as he has done.",
