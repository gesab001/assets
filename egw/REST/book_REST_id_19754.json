    "word": "The enemy of truth, through the ministry of fallen angels, \n     would be pleased to introduce uncertainty in the minds of many in \n     regard to the doctrines that have been established by the sanction \n     of the Holy Spirit. Disguised as one who has a deep understanding \n     of truth, Satan will seek to point out supposed errors in that \n     which needs no revision, and it will take much time and patient \n     labor to restore confidence in those whose minds are unsettled \n     by unnecessary changes. God forbids His servants to alter that \n     which needs no change. (Ibid.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. January 29, 1981",
