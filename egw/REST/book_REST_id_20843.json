    "word": "Those who have not taken themselves in hand to control impulse, to subdue self and bring themselves in obedience to the principles of the law of God, will not, can not, be happy or at peace and rest. They need the meekness and lowliness of Christ. They need to learn daily in His school, to wear His yoke, to lift His burdens, to deny inclination, to sacrifice a seeming present good to a future good, a personal advantage for a general advantage.",
