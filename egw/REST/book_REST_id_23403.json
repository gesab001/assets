    "word": "The Lord\u2019s servants are to feel a noble, generous sympathy for every line of work carried on in the great harvest field. We are to be interested in everything that concerns\n64\nthe human brotherhood. By our baptismal vows we are bound in covenant relation with God to make persevering, self-denying, self-sacrificing efforts to promote, in the hardest parts of the field, the work of soul-saving. God has placed upon every believer the responsibility of helping to rescue the most needy, the most helpless, the most oppressed. Christians are to enlighten the ignorance of their less-favored brothers. They are to break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free from the power of vicious habits and sinful practises. By imparting the knowledge sent from heaven, they are to enlarge the capabilities, and increase the usefulness, of those most in need of a helping hand.",
