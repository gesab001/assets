    "word": "On Eastbound Train, Nearing Reno, 1884--To Willie and Mary. Nearing Reno: Will be at Reno in one half an hour. We had a very good night's rest. After you left us, we were told our position was in the next car and thither we went, seated ourselves, and found it was filled with men. We were the only women in the car. At night we had two other women. We had tobacco effluvia creeping into our car, which made my heart very active and my throat and lungs sore, but I may not be troubled as much today. My head aches some, but I feel of good courage.",
