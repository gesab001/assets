    "word": "Christ has sent you His invitation: \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). Then if Christ has not placed upon you a galling yoke, do not take one that \n\n\n                                   -39- \n\nany human being has made. Cooperating with Jesus Christ makes His yoke easy for you, and your daily burdens will be lightened by communion with Him. Let no earthly ties, however dear, obstruct the course of duty which He has made plain, but let no human agents frame duties for you.",
