    "word": "At school you had a good and noble teacher, yet you felt indignant because you were restrained. You thought that because you were the daughter of Elder Cole, your teacher should show a preference for you and should not take the liberty to correct and reprove you.

You were bold, selfish, and self-exalted, and needed firm discipline at home as well as at school.",
