    "word": "There has been a reckless disregard manifested for the souls of men and women in Ligonier. There has been a spirit of push and crowd and thrust out from the church. In this there has not been exercised the spirit of the true Shepherd who has an interest for the souls for whom Christ died. The spirit of the self-righteous Pharisees has been cherished by men and women who profess to believe the truth. They were working to be first in everything. They loved the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in synagogues, but shut up the kingdom of heaven against men, neither going in themselves nor permitting others to enter; and who, for a pretense made long prayers, but secretly devoured widows' houses; who paid tithe of mint and anise and cummin, but neglected the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and the love of God; who externally appeared to love the truth and to be very zealous for the cause of God, while the heart was left unsubdued, unsanctified, unhumbled, open to jealousy, hatred, and malice.",
