    "word": "The light came to me, clear and distinct, that the Medical Missionary work was absorbing too much, while a more definite work in special lines was being neglected, that you gathering into your arms a class of work that is never-ending, which was eclipsing the work that needs to be done in every city,-the proclamation of the soon coming of Christ. The third angel's message was being blanketed, and you were not altogether straight on these things. There was danger in several ways that you did not discern. You are a man of special influence. You will sway heavily in any course you take, whether right or wrong; and I wrote to this effect. The danger is that you will withdraw yourself, and make of your work a great center; and this you will certainly do unless you fulfill to the letter the word of the Lord. You are to build up, and in no wise to weaken or tear down. The Lord will lead you if you do not pull too strong to lead yourself. When you are baptized with the Holy Spirit of God, you will draw in harmony. You are to stop censuring your brethren, and they are to help to sustain you; for a heavy responsibility rests upon you. You are not to exalt the work you are doing; for it is only as the arm is to the body. This cannot and must not be. You would make the medical missionary work the body and not the arm. You are out of order, and you must be called to order. I write this because I do not want everything turned in this one channel to the extinguishing of every other important work. God does not want your sympathies drawn wholly in one direction while everything else is ignored.",
