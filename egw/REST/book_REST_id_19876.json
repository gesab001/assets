    "word": "The Lord directed Brethren Sutherland and Magan, as men of sound principles, to establish a work in the South. They have devised and planned and sacrificed in order to carry forward the work there on right lines, but the work has been greatly delayed. The Lord guided in the selection of the farm at Madison, and He desires that it be managed on right lines, that others, learning from the workers there, might take up a similar work, and conduct it in like manner. Brethren Sutherland and Magan are chosen of God and faithful, and the Lord of heaven says of them, I have a special work for these men to do at Madison, a work of educating and training young men and women for mission fields. The Spirit of the Lord will be with His workers if they will walk humbly with Him. He has not bound about and restricted the labors of these self-denying, self-sacrificing men. . . .",
