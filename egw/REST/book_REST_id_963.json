    "word": "There is danger of both parents and teachers commanding and dictating too much, while they fail to come sufficiently into social relation with their children, or their scholars. They often hold themselves too much reserved, and exercise their authority in a cold, unsympathizing manner, which cannot win the hearts of their children and pupils. If they would gather the children close to them, and show that they love them, and manifest an interest in all their efforts, and even in their sports, and sometimes be even a child among them, they would make the children \n                                                                           8\nvery happy, would gain their love, and win their confidence. And the children would sooner respect and love the authority of their parents and teachers.",
