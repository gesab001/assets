They should not engage in traffic of any kind, or in any business aside from this one great work. The solemn charge given to Timothy rests will equal weight upon them, laying upon them the most solemn obligations and most fearful responsibilities: \u201cI charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word; \n196\nbe instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.\u201d \u201cBut watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.\u201d [2 Timothy 4:1, 2, 5.]",
