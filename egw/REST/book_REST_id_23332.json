    "word": "I saw that there should be no close, sharp dealing between these brethren who were representatives of two important institutions of a different character, but branches of the same work. They should ever maintain a noble, generous, Christlike spirit; the spirit of grasping avarice should have no place in their dealings with each other. God's cause cannot be advanced by any acts which are contrary to the Spirit and character of Christ. Men should show an unselfish interest, seeking to advance one another's interest; for the cause of God can afford to be fair. Even a single instance of sharp dealing is an offense to God; and that which is sown will be reaped again. A selfish manner of dealing will provoke the same spirit in others. So with the manifestation of a Christian gentleman in spirit and word and deed; liberality, courtesy awaken the same spirit in others.",
