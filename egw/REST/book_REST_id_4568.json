    "word": "Respect of Persons\n     Ministers should not use flattery or be respecters of persons. There ever has been, and still is, great danger of erring here, of making a little difference with the wealthy, of flattering them by special attention, if not by words. There is danger of \u201chaving men's persons in admiration\u201d [Jude 16.] for the sake of gain, but if one does this, he endangers their eternal interests. Some wealthy man may regard the minister as a special favorite, and may be very liberal with him; this gratifies the minister, and he, in turn, lavishes praise upon the benevolence of his donor. His name may be exalted by appearing in print, and yet, that liberal donor may be entirely unworthy of the credit given him. His liberality did not arise from a deep, living principle to do good with his means, to advance the cause of God because he appreciated it, but from some selfish motive, a desire to be thought liberal. He may have given from impulse, and his liberality have no depth of principle. He may have been moved upon by listening to stirring truth, which for the time being loosed his purse-strings; yet, after all, his liberality has no deeper motive. He gives by spasms; his purse opens spasmodically, and closes just as securely, spasmodically. He deserves no commendation, for he is in every sense of the word a stingy man; and unless thoroughly converted, purse and all, will hear the withering denunciation, \u201cGo to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are \n272\nmoth-eaten.\u201d [James 5:1, 2.] Such will awake at last from a horrible self-deception. Those who praised their spasmodic liberalities helped Satan to deceive them, and made them think that they were very liberal, very sacrificing, when they knew not the first principles of liberality or self-sacrifice.\u2014Vol. 1, p. 475.",
