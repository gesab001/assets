    "word": "There is a great dearth of the Spirit of life from Jesus Christ in the church. But the members can not be reached and impressed until those who labor for them are feeding upon Christ, the Bread of Life, and drinking his blood. Then \n\n\n                        -3- \n\ntheir experience in religious things will be of a healthier order, and in the place of unrest and dissatisfaction, because the spirit is restless, they will heed the admonition God has given them. But if they have a desire to draw away from the work, if their hearts are not in it, they will sow seeds in the minds of those connected with them that will surely lead into false paths. And all this will be because they do not appreciate the work and cause of God as anything but common work.",
