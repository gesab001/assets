    "word": "Those who love God supremely and their fellow-men as themselves, will be ready to every good word and work. If they understand that the voice of God says, \"Go,\" they do not stop to confer with flesh and blood, or allow their temporal, personal interest to block the way. They reason that Jesus gave himself to save their souls from ruin, and although they think it possible for them to do but little, they \n                                                                           23\nwill do that heartily as to the Lord. They first give themselves, and they call not anything their own which they possess, whether it be aptitude, skill in any direction, learning, position, wealth or influence; they regard themselves as stewards of the manifold grace of God and servants for Christ's sake. It is such men and women that are Christ's witnesses. Their hearts throb in unison with His, their ears are quick to hear every Macedonian cry. O-19b-1892.",
