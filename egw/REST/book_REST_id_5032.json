    "word": "Again, the command is given, \u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d It is not the wicked world, but those whom the Lord designates as \u201cmy people,\u201d that are to be reproved for their transgressions. He declares further, \u201cYet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God.\u201d [Isaiah 58:1, 2.] Here is brought to view a class who think themselves righteous, and appear to manifest great interest in the service of God; but the stern and solemn rebuke of the Searcher of hearts proves them to be trampling upon the divine precepts.",
