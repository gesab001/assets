    "word": "Mary, I feel the deepest interest for you. I love you. I know that your happiness depends upon the course of your action. And unless it is entirely different in many respects than it has been, you cannot have life, have salvation. I have written this letter sadly, discouragingly. My heart aches while I write. Gladly would I write encouragingly if I had it to write. I was in hopes that God would never give me another message for you. I fear the use you will make of it, and it will prove a savor of death unto death. Mary, I have felt agony of soul. I have cried in agony for above an hour.",
