WHITE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD VACCINATION: \n     \"YOU ASK FOR DEFINITE AND CONCISE INFORMATION REGARDING WHAT SISTER WHITE WROTE ABOUT VACCINATION AND SERUM. \n     \"THIS QUESTION CAN BE ANSWERED VERY BRIEFLY FOR SO FAR AS WE HAVE ANY RECORD, SHE DID NOT REFER TO THEM IN ANY OF HER WRITINGS. \n     \"YOU WILL BE INTERESTED TO KNOW, HOWEVER, THAT AT A TIME WHEN THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF SMALLPOX IN THE VICINITY, SHE HERSELF WAS VACCINATED AND URGED HER HELPERS, THOSE CONNECTED WITH HER, TO BE VACCINATED. IN TAKING THIS STEP SISTER WHITE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT VACCINATION EITHER RENDERS ONE IMMUNE FROM SMALLPOX OR GREATLY LIGHTENS ITS EFFECTS IF ONE DOES COME DOWN WITH IT. SHE ALSO RECOGNIZED THE DANGER OF THEIR EXPOSING OTHERS IF THEY FAILED TO TAKE THIS PRECAUTION. \n                              \"[SIGNED] D. E. ROBINSON.\"]",
