    "word": "It means much to our physicians whether they are wearing the yoke of Christ or the yoke of some man. Those who are wearing a yoke that man has placed on their necks will have to be freed from this yoke before they can act the part that God desires them to act in the proclamation of the truth. Those who receive and believe in Jesus are not to wear any man's yoke, neither are they to be non-committal in regard to where they stand. A fierce conflict is raging between two powers,--the power of light and the power of darkness. This conflict has a vital interest for the people of God. The question that is asked us is, Who will stand on the Lord's side? You can not remain neutral, and yet be Christ's followers, His faithful servants.",
