    "word": "On our ride from Christiania to Gottenburg, Sweden, the wild mountain scenery in some places reminded us of Colorado. But neither the height of the mountains nor the grandeur of the landscape equals that of Colorado. We passed through extensive pine forests; but the trees do not grow to a large size; they are small, and set close together. The soil is rocky and sterile. We occasionally saw evidences of wealth and prosperity, but most of the dwellings are small and poor. It is only by constant industry and frugality that the people here obtain a livelihood.",
