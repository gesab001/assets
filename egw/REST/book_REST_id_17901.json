    "word": "Some of the teachers in the College have failed to realize the responsibility of their position. They have not themselves been learners in the school of Christ, and hence they have not been prepared to instruct others. Some things have occurred that have strengthened the irreligious element in the school. Strong feelings of disunion have existed among the teachers. There has been considerable dissatisfaction with Bro. Bell's manner of dealing with students. He has not always pursued such a course as would exert the best influence. To some, he has seemed harsh and unsympathetic. He could not tolerate the listless indifference which students at times manifested. That which interested him, he thought should interest his class. The stinging remarks which he would make at times, left most disagreeable impressions upon sensitive minds that did not know him well.",
