The standard must be elevated. We do not plead for inactivity, we would not have one soul blunt his activities, but only purify his enterprises of all selfishness, ambition, pride and self-exaltation. Let pure and undefiled religion be the controlling power in all our institutions. Let it be practiced by all who are connected with the work. Those who make a profession of godliness, and have a corrupt, sensual heart, will develop themselves, that they may be known by those around them. He who is scheming for himself will work in a way to bring profit to himself, while he is very careful to all appearance to see that others shall in no case take advantage of their place or position to reap benefits that he himself obtained. This carefulness on his part to exclude others from dishonest advantage pacifies his conscience, for he believes he is guarding the interest of the institution.",
