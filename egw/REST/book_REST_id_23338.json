    "word": "(Recopied February 7, 1895) \n                   Christiania, Norway, October 1, 1885 \n\nDear Brother Butler: \n\n\n     I was more sorry than I can express, to learn that under your instruction Brother Farnsworth and Burrill sought to restrict the work at the New York camp meeting. You could not have advised them to do a worse thing, and you should not have put a work into their hands that they were not fitted to do in a wise manner. Be careful how you repress advancing work in any locality. There is little enough being done in any place, and it certainly is not proper to seek to curtail operations in missionary lines.",
