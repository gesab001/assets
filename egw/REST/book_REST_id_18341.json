    "word": "Our schools are a very important factor in our work. We want to educate our youth so that they will work in harmony with the mind and the will of God. We desire to help them to prepare their hearts to work in harmony with Jesus Christ, the great Teacher. In support of His teachings He could say, \"It is written.\" He carried the light of truth wherever He went. So our students, after they have received a training, will be ready to be transferred from the school to mission fields in all parts of the world. These fields are opening, and calls for help are coming from every side more than we can supply. Let everyone take an interest in this matter, and let all who can do so make free-will offerings to help in the purchase of this property.",
