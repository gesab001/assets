    "word": "Of himself, what can man accomplish in the great work set forth by the infinite God? Christ says, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" John 15:5. He came to our world to show men how to do the work given them by God, and He says to us, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in the heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" Matthew 11:28-30. Why is Christ's yoke easy and His burden light? Because He bore the weight of it upon the cross of Calvary.",
