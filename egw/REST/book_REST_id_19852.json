    "word": "We have been, until today, remarkably free from dust. It has been cool and very pleasant. We have rested some and written considerable; this, with \n\n\n                                  -135- \n\nthe care of our children, Addie and May, [ADDIE AND MAY WALLING, ELLEN WHITE'S NIECES, WHOM SHE REARED AS HER OWN DAUGHTERS.] has taxed me considerably. Not that the children have been unusual and unmanageable. They are good children. They are universally cheerful and happy and willing to obey our expressed wishes, cheerfully. This has lightened my burden of care wonderfully. Were these children as unruly and boisterous as many children in this car, I should be indeed worn out before this time, but their innocent ways and happy laughs are contagious. We cannot be otherwise than cheerful.",
