    "word": "My brother, the lesson of meekness and lowliness of heart you must learn more fully than you ever yet have done, or you will never see the kingdom of heaven. In your present condition you would even think in heaven that you could improve upon the management of Christ. In learning in Christ's school, ambition, pride, self-esteem, will all be subdued, self will be hid in Christ, and you will find peace and rest to your soul. We are to look constantly upon the meek and holy Sufferer who in His own body bore our sins, who knew our griefs, who has carried our sorrows.",
