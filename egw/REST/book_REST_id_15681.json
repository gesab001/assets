    "word": "Solemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of the atonement. Momentous are the interests involved therein. The judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. . . . Soon\u2014none know how soon\u2014it will pass to the cases of the living. . . .When the work of the investigative judgment closes, the destiny of all will have been decided for life or death. Probation is ended a short time before the appearing of the Lord in the clouds of heaven. Christ in the Revelation, looking forward to that time, declares: . . . \u201cBehold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\u201d\u2014Gospel Herald, August 1910.",
