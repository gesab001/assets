    "word": "Christ went about doing good, feeding the hungry, healing the sick, comforting the downcast. None in need of succor went from Him without finding sympathy--sympathy shown not only in word but in deed. In His presence every stricken, sorrowing heart was soothed and lightened. He did not think of Himself or seek His own interests. He lived to benefit others, to bring relief to the suffering and oppressed. The unwearied servant of man's necessity, He was blessed Himself in relieving others. His heart of love was a fountain of blessings that ever flowed forth to gladden hearts.",
