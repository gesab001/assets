    "word": "The instruction is to \"lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.\"  It is for our own interest that we secure heavenly riches.  God is not benefited by our benevolence.  The cattle upon a thousand hills are His.  \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.\" Psalm 24:1.  But in using the gifts that He has entrusted to our care for the salvation of souls, we transfer our wealth to the treasury of heaven.  When we are seeking the glory of God, and hasting unto the day of God, we are colaborers with Christ, and our joy is not a base and fleeting emotion; but it is the joy of our Lord.  We are elevated above the corroding, perplexing cares of this frail, fickle world.",
