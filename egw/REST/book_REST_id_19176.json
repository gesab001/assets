    "word": "I think that I have told you how I lost on my prune crop last year. A young man, our nearest neighbor, bought the whole crop. He also bought largely from others who have prune orchards. He contracted for more than he could handle, and then the rain came early, and spoiled tons and tons of prunes. The young man lost everything, and could not pay his creditors for the prunes that they had sold him. My loss was between five hundred and seven hundred dollars. I may possibly get fifty dollars after the young man's mother has sold this year's crop of prunes.",
