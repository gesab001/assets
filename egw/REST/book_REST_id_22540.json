    "word": "In Australia we have been wrestling to get a sanitarium established, and a building is now in process of erection, though not yet completed. The sanitarium work was started in a private dwelling-house, and the one in charge of it devoted part of his time to Conference work and part of his time to medical work. He was afraid that it would not be possible to pay the rent of the house which had been hired; so in order to help, I rented one room, and Brother Baker rented two. But these rooms were soon needed for patients, and the work has grown so that at the present time several houses are rented for the sanitarium patients and nurses.",
