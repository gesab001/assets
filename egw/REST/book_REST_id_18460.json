    "word": "This is a time of general departure from truth and righteousness, and now we must build the old waste places, and with interested effort labor to raise up the foundations of many generations. \"Thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it\" [Isaiah 58:12-14]. (See Isaiah 51:7-16;  62:1-4.)",
