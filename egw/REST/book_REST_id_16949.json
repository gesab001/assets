'As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.' The Lord sanctions the efforts of the consecrated worker, the true shepherd. He may have little time to preach \n                                                                            4\ndiscourses, but he can act sermons which will be far more powerful. The truth expressed in living, unselfish deeds is the strongest argument for Christianity. The relieving of the sick, the helping of the distressed, is working in Christ's lines, and demonstrates most powerful gospel truths representing Christ's mission and work upon earth. The knowledge of the art of relieving suffering humanity is the opening of doors without number, where the truth can find a lodgment in the heart, and souls be saved unto life--eternal life. Even the most hard-hearted and apparently sin-encased souls may be approached in this way, and understand something of the mystery of godliness, and become so charmed that they will not rest until they have a knowledge of Jesus Christ and his saving grace. The divine love of God has transformed their hard, rocky characters into meek disciples of Jesus Christ. O, what a work such souls can do to reach others who are as hard as themselves! May the Lord work, is my prayer.\"",
