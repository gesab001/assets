    "word": "With your selfish propensities, your care for your own interest, you would have not more chance to exercise faith and trust in God than you have had since you commenced to labor in this cause. Times have changed, but you who know nothing comparatively of hardships and privations should be the last ones to claim or plead consideration on account of your privations and labors, on that score. When you make appeals in this direction, when you tell what you have done and how you have labored, you give evidence that you esteem your labors as of more value than they will bear; certainly higher than God regards them as He has shown me the result of your labors.",
