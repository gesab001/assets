    "word": "A Means of Creating Interest \n\n     When the question of establishing restaurants was first introduced, it was clearly pointed out that the one aim and object of their work was to be the conversion of souls. It was not that you might invent the many fancy dishes to gratify the appetite, and have no time left to devote to the work of creating in the minds of others an interest in the truth. Some attempts may have been made to interest souls in the truth, but they have been but feeble in comparison with what should have been done. MS.-150-1905.",
