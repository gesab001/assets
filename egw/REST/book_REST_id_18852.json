    "word": "MR No. 276 - The Work in Mountain View, California\n\n     Our work is a sacred one. It should be our aim to so order the work in every place in a way that is well pleasing to God. Every one connected with this work should heed the words of Christ, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\"",
