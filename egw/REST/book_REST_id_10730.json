    "word": "Children are a heritage of the Lord, and are to be trained for his service. This is the work that rests upon parents and teachers with solemn, sacred force, which they cannot evade or ignore. To neglect this work marks them as unfaithful servants; but there is a reward when the seed of truth is early sown in the heart, and carefully tended. Christ concludes the parable, \"But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.\" When the harvest of the earth is reaped, we shall see the result of our toil; for we shall see those for whom we have labored and prayed gathered into the heavenly garner. So shall we enter into the joy of our Lord, when he shall \"see of the travail of his soul, and be satisfied.\" \n\n                                               -",
