    "word": "I want to say to whomsoever the glory of God has been revealed, \"You will never have the least inclination to say, 'I am holy, I am sanctified.'\" After my first vision of glory, I could not discern the brightest light. It was thought that my eyesight was gone, but when I again became accustomed to the things of this world I could see again. This is why I tell you never to boast, saying, \"I am holy, I am sanctified,\" for it is the surest evidence that you know not the Scriptures or the power of God. Let God write it in His books if He will, but you should never utter it.",
