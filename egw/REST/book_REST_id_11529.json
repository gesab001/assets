    "word": "I was pointed back, and saw the condition of God's people in 1844. Then God was pleased with them, and his love rested upon them. I was carried down still further, and saw that they were not as devoted. Instead of going on from strength to strength, they have been growing weaker. They do not possess living faith. Their fruits are not such as will please God. A stupid indifference hangs upon them. They lack fervent piety. They manifest but very little melting love for Jesus, and warm affection for their brethren.",
