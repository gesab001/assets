    "word": "Patience implies that we have difficulties to encounter, annoyances to meet. The Word of God says, \"A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger\" (Proverbs 15:1). \"Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools\" (Ecclesiastes 7:9). The injunction of the inspired apostle is to \"be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath\" (James 1:9). Anger provokes anger.",
