    "word": "A spurious light will be accepted in the place of truth by some who feel called upon to be expositors of the Scriptures, because of their calling or position. Extravagance, dishonesty, fraud, licentiousness, are mingled with \n\n\n                                    -184- \n\nsacred things, until no difference is made between the sacred and the common. Many who claim to preach the Word contemplate some portions of Scripture truth, but do not apply it to the heart and character. They expatiate upon the plan of redemption, and upon the law of God, and become enthusiastic upon some of these glorious themes, but they take no personal interest in the matter. Christ is not brought into their lives. Can we then be surprised to hear of ministers falling under temptation and sin, disgracing the cause they were professedly advocating? Can we wonder that there are apostasies when men who urge conversion upon others are not themselves converted; when they commend to others the love of Christ, which does not glow in their own souls, preaching repentance which they themselves have not practiced, and faith which they have no experimental knowledge of, telling of a Saviour whom they have never known except by rumor? They are self-deceived men, not far from destruction. Pitiful indeed is their situation. All may seem peaceful to them, because the palsy of death is upon them.--Ms 15, 1886, pp. 8, 9.
