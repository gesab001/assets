    "word": "I have a conversation with Elder Whitney. He presents before me the necessity of our speedily visiting Italy. They need help at this time. I would have been gratified to have had a week's rest, but I must not consult my own wishes or my pleasure. Jesus did not live to please Himself. He lived to do others good, and He is our example in all things. A stove is placed in my room so that I may kindle a fire when I arise early in the morning. If I had only had this one day earlier I should have escaped this cold which I have contracted.",
