    "word": "My brother, my sister, yield your whole mind and soul and body to the Lord. Rest in the arms of your compassionate Saviour. You need not rush hither and thither to obtain relief from human agencies. Christ is nigh, inviting you, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" [Matthew 11:28-30].",
