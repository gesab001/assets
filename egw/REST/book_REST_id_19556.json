    "word": "MR No. 725 - Compelling Power in Preaching\n\n     I was shown that Brethren [J.N.] Loughborough, [Moses] Hull, and [J.N.] Andrews have been greedy for too many books. They have read and studied more than they can retain, and I was shown that much study is a weariness of the flesh (Ecclesiastes 12:12). They have not given the mind time to rest, and the mind affects the body. Weary the mind and the body suffers. It is injured. They have taken upon the mind more than they can use to any advantage, and then they injure the work, injure the effect of the truth that they would advocate, by crowding into one discourse so much and making so many points that minds cannot always appreciate or follow them. More success would attend their labors if they riveted one or two points in the minds of the hearers and make these points of vital importance, press them home and urge upon them the danger of rejecting the light upon those points. Let the minds of the hearers distinctly understand the bearing of every point and then urge to a decision.",
