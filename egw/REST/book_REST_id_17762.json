    "word": "The Cities to be Enlightened. \n\n     The ministry of the word in our cities rests not merely upon those who preach the word, but upon all who read and hear the word. God calls upon His people to break the bands of their precise, indoor service. He would have hundreds in our cities doing the work that Christ did while on this earth,--cheering the sorrowful, strengthening the weak, comforting the mourners, preaching the gospel to the poor. In many of the cities of America scarcely anything has been done to proclaim the message of warning. Our brethren and sisters living in these crowded centers should let their light shine amidst the moral darkness. More than one may think that his light is too small to do any good, but he should remember that it is what God has given him, and that he is held responsible for letting it shine forth. Some one else may light his taper from it, and his light may be the means of leading others out from the darkness.",
