    "word": "Colporteur to Reveal Christ.--Christ's interests are the first and the highest of all interests. He has a property in this world that He wishes secured, saved for His everlasting kingdom. It is for His Father's glory and for His own glory that His messengers shall go forth in His name; for they and He are one. They are to reveal Him to the world. His interests are their interests. If they will be colaborers with Him, they will be made heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ to an immortal inheritance.--Review and Herald, June 2, 1903.",
