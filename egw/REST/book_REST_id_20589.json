    "word": "If our hearts were more fully imbued with the Spirit of God, we should have His melting love, and should work with spiritual power to restore the erring and not leave them under Satan's control. We need good, heart religion and divine wisdom to deal with human minds, that we shall not only reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine, but we shall take the erring in our arms of faith and bear them to the cross of Christ. We must bring them in contact with the sin-pardoning Saviour.",
