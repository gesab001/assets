    "word": "Even to the Disinterested.--Go to the homes of those even who manifest no interest. While mercy's sweet voice invites the sinner, work with every energy of heart and brain, as did Paul, \"who ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears.\" In the day of God, how many will confront us, and say, \"I am lost! I am lost! And you never warned me; you never entreated me to come to Jesus. Had I believed as you did, I would have followed every Judgment-bound soul within my reach with prayers and tears and warnings.\"--Review and Herald, June 24, 1884.",
