JONES: THE NEXT THING BEFORE US FOR CONSIDERATION HERE TODAY IS CARRYING ON THE WORK IN THIS INSTITUTION. WHEN WE HAD OUR ANNUAL MEETING AND ELECTED THE NEW BOARD OF THE STATE MEDICAL MISSIONARY AND BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION, WE DID NOT COMPLETE THE WORK OF REORGANIZING THE LOCAL BOARDS, ET CETERA, FOR THE COMING YEAR, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SANITARIUM AND THE MEDICAL WORK. THAT COMES BEFORE US NOW FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, SO WHATEVER YOU MIGHT SAY TO US WITH REFERENCE TO THE WORK HERE AND ITS NEEDS WOULD BE LIGHT TO US IN REFERENCE TO OUR WORK OF REORGANIZATION AND IN STARTING ON A NEW BASIS FOR THE YEAR TO COME.",
