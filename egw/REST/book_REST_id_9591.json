    "word": "You should not carry the burden of leading the church in meetings.  Younger hands should do this, and you should not bear the responsibility.  You should not feel that you are required to hold meetings yourself, having the charge in different places, for your mind and your physical strength are not equal to the task.  You are in danger of heaping responsibilities upon you and feeling that the Lord requires it of you, after He has released you from active, physical taxation.  You should gracefully and honorably lay the burden down, and seek for quiet rest, fitting up for your last change.  You feel much tried and grieved if your Advent brethren do not look to you to lead, when I have been shown it is wrong for them to let the leading of the church rest on you.",
