    "word": "Our minds must be stayed on God, not on men who have lost their bearings, and who do not discern that position can not give a man unerring judgment. Every man is to fear and honor God. All are to reverence Him, and to show their interest in His people. There must be a constant seeking for divine instructions. The Lord has not appointed one man to exercise his conscience for another man.",
