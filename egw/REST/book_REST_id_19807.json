    "word": "MR No. 868 - Western Transportation in the Times of Ellen White\n\n     Cheyenne, Wyoming, August 21, 1878--We are now in the hotel waiting the overland train from California. It is rather warm. We have had no sleep of any account yet. I left one package of \"Sunshine Series\" for that gentleman who attended to the sprained ankle. The package of hominy is in father's room on the shelf. We feel that we will get through all right. I feel that I am in the way of my duty, although I am very tired, and long for rest. The train comes to take us at half-past three. I hope you will all go over to the park and have a pleasant camping trip. You may never have as good a time again to make this trip.--Letter 45, 1878, p. 1. (Post card to Ellen White's family, who were vacationing at Rollinsville, Colorado.)",
