    "word": "It is impossible for man to change the institution of the Sabbath. When God laid the foundations of the earth he laid the foundations of the Sabbath. He rested on the Sabbath, and sanctified it, and pronounced it holy. They were to keep it for a sign to a thousand generations, and by that time we shall be in the city of God. This is worth your thinking about. We cannot be sanctified through error. We have an open Bible. Where is your foundation for Sunday?--Ms 17, 1893, pp. 6, 7. (\"The Law and the Love of God,\" March 26, 1893.)",
