    "word": "Money cannot confer happiness without the Lord's name is glorified with its use. When money charms the heart because it is [in] the hands of the human agent, it is a snare; it is a master, not an agent for accomplishing the greatest amount of good. It is regarded above the favor of God, takes the place of an idol, and is worshiped as such. But when property, money, or any other thing interposes itself between man and his obedience to God, that money is ruinous to the eternal interests of the soul. We cannot serve God and mammon.",
