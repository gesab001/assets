    "word": "A spurious light will be accepted in the place of truth by some who feel called upon to be expositors of the Scriptures, because of their calling or position. Extravagance, dishonesty, fraud, licentiousness, are mingled with sacred things, until no difference is made between the sacred and the common. Many who claim to preach the Word contemplate some portions of Scripture truth, but do not apply it to the heart and character. They expatiate upon the plan of redemption and upon the law of God and become enthusiastic upon some of these glorious themes, but they take no personal interest in the matter. Christ is not brought into their lives.",
