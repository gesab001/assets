    "word": "Some parents were not judicious. They injured the influence of Bro. Bell, and themselves more, in talking freely over the complaints made by their children. These parents did not have sufficient interest in the instruction of their children to visit the school, and thus manifest an interest in the progress of their children, and for the encouragement of their teacher. They preferred to hold themselves aloof, and look on coldly and indifferently, unless they could find something of which to complain. Their limber tongues worked easily, repeating incidents which had transpired in school contrary to their children's childish ideas of wise discipline.",
