    "word": "I appeal to our brethren everywhere to awake, to consecrate themselves to God, and to seek wisdom from him. I appeal to the officers of our conferences to make earnest efforts in our churches to arouse them to give of their means for sustaining foreign missions. The Foreign Mission Board needs to carry a continual responsibility in this line. Unless your hearts are touched as you see the situation in foreign fields, the last message of mercy to be given to the world will be restricted, and the work which God would have done will be left undone.",
