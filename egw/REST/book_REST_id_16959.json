    "word": "You are indulging in evil which threatens to destroy your spirituality. It will eclipse all the beauty and interest of the sacred pages. It is love for story books, tales, and other reading which does not have an influence for good upon the mind that is in any way dedicated to the service of God. It produces a false, unhealthy excitement, fevers the imagination, unfits the mind for usefulness, and disqualifies it for any spiritual exercise. . . . The oftener and more diligently you peruse the Scriptures, the more beautiful will they appear, and the less relish will you have for light reading.-- Testimonies, Vol. I, pp. 241, 242.",
