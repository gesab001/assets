    "word": "Meat Eating. \n\n                                    Sunnyside, Cooranbong, Nov. 5, 1896. \n\nDear Brother and Sister Maxson:-- \n\n\n     I have had the letter of August 12, written to you for a long time, but I decided to send that which I have already sent you, withholding that which I now send. You cannot understand how much more effectual your services in the religious interest would be, and how much more satisfactory to yourself, if you would follow the light which has been given you. But it is a phase of your character to strenuously hold to your own ideas, and if possible, carry them out. Every soul of us is in danger, and if we refuse the light, darkness will come upon all. We never proposed to establish sanitariums to have them run in nearly the same grooves as other institutions. If we do not have a sanitarium which is in many things decidedly contrary to other institutions, we can see nothing gained. Shall our appetites, habits, and practices be of that order that you will educate those who are connected with you to make excuses similar to those you have made for the indulgence of eating the flesh of animals?",
