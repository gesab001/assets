    "word": "The colored people of the South need the sympathy and help of everyone. I would invite those who have means that they are willing to invest in the cause of God to send to me donations for this needy field, and I will see that the means thus\n106\nreceived is sent to the workers in the South. I have sent several hundred pounds of prunes to help them, but I have not been able to send them much money. My money has been exhausted in the preparation of new books\u2014books that the people need, which I prepare in harmony with the will of God. In order to help in the establishment of sanitariums in southern California, I have hired money from the bank at heavy interest.",
