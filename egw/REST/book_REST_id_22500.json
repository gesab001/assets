    "word": "O what is our excuse, my sisters, that we do not devote all the time possible to searching the Scriptures, making the mind a storehouse of precious things, that we may present them to those who are not interested in the truth. Will our sisters arise to the emergency? Will they work for the Master? They must have the Spirit of Christ as well as being called by his name. They must walk even as he walked, purifying their souls from everything that defileth, even as Christ is pure. When Christ died to redeem the entire human race from ruin, he certainly meant greater things than our eyes have witnessed. The Lord never intended that the very large majority of the people in the world should die in their sins. \n     (W. H. Dec. 18, '96.)",
