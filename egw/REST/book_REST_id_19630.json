You have worked as an evangelist, and your words and deeds have opened many doors for the entrance of the truth. I have not a doubt but that the Lord has given you your work. He has greatly blessed you in your canvassing. This is because you have kept at the work, and have given Him the glory.--Letter 174, 1903. (To Walter Harper, August 5, 1903.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 25, 1980",
