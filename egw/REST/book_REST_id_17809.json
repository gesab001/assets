    "word": "The Lord would have all who act a part in his work, bear testimony in their lives to the holy character of the truth. The end is near, and now is the time when Satan will make special efforts to distract the interest \n\n\n                        [5] \n\nand separate it from the all-important subjects that should arrest every mind to concentrated action. An army could do nothing successfully if its different parts did not work in concert. Should each soldier act without reference to the others, the army would soon become disorganized. Instead of gathering strength from concentrated action, it would be wasted in desultory meaningless efforts. Christ prayed that his disciple might be one with him as he was one with the Father. A limited number united under one head, all obeying orders, will accomplish more than ten times the number who are drawing apart, who expend their strength on many things at the same time. Whatever good qualities a man may have, he cannot be a good soldier if he acts independently. Good may occasionally be done, but often the result is of little value, and often the end shows more mischief than good. Those who act independently make a show of doing something, attract attention, and flash out brightly, and then are gone. All must pull in one direction in order to render efficient service to the cause. In Healdsburg some have acted from self-will. They have a high appreciation of their own ability. They put a great estimate on their own plans, and are all ready to take offense at the doings of others, and they refuse to act in concert. Now these, I saw in my dream, were attracted to you, and God's blessing cannot attend them, because his spirit does not rule in their hearts, or control their actions.",
