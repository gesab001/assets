    "word": "Are you prepared to do it? Are you preparing? Are you preparing to give an account of yourself before you shall go to rest in the night season? Have you called to mind what you can do (890) to glorify God? Now, here is this institution and we are glad we have it. It is just what we wanted and now we want to act our individual part in it every one of us. We believe in Jesus Christ that He is our Saviour and that He will bear our sins and we want to glorify His name. But many who are coming into position just as soon as they consider that they are looked upon as those who can help--they grow into such large proportions that they cannot handle themselves nor anybody else. We want to be humble workers for Jehovah. We have to face the future of this work; we have to face it. We want those who come to this institution to obtain just as much blessing as they possibly can obtain. We want them to receive instruction, and light and physical health and understanding, so that when they return to their homes they can treat their own families and their own sick, and no doubt many consider this a great advantage. \n\n\n                              -537-",
