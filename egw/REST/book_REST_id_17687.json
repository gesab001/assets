    "word": "Something has been done in foreign missions, and something in home missions; but altogether too much territory has been left unworked. The work is too much centralized. The interests in Battle Creek are overgrown, and this means that other portions of the field are robbed of facilities which they should have had. The larger and still larger preparations, in the erection and enlargement of buildings, which have called together and \n\n\n                   -63- \n\nheld so large a number in Battle Creek, are not in accordance with God's plan, but in direct contravention of his plan. It has been urged that there were great advantages in having so many institutions in close connection; that they would be a strength to one another, and could afford help to those seeking education and employment. This is according to human reasoning; it will be admitted that from a human point of view, many advantages are gained by crowding so many responsibilities in Battle Creek; but the vision needs to be extended. These interests should be broken up into many parts, in order that the work may start in cities which it will be necessary to make centers of interest. Buildings should be erected and responsibilities centered in many localities that are now robbed of vital, spiritual interest, in order to swell the overplus already in Battle Creek. The Lord is not glorified by this management on the part of those who are in responsible positions. \"The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\" \"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\"",
