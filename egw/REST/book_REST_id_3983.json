    "word": "On the morning of October 23, 1879, about two o'clock, the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I beheld scenes in the coming judgment. . . .

Several books were before Him, and upon the covers of each was written in letters of gold, which seemed like a burning flame of fire: \"Ledger of Heaven.\" One of these books, containing the names of those who claim to believe the truth, was then opened. . . . As these persons were named, one by one, and their good deeds mentioned, their countenances would light up with a holy joy. . . .",
