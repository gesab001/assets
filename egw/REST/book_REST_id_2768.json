    "word": "Short, Interesting Articles.--When at our large gatherings, make all the discourses highly reformative. Arouse the intellect. Bring up the talents possible into the efforts made, and then follow up the effort with tracts and pamphlets, with articles written in simple form, to make the subjects brought before them distinctly stated, that the word spoken may be repeated by the silent agent. Short, interesting articles should be arranged in cheap style, and scattered everywhere. They should be at hand upon every occasion where the truth is brought before the minds of those to whom it is new and strange.",
