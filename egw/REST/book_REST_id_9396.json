    "word": "My brother, my sister, God's purpose for you is that you shall live a life that will make others better--a life which will show that Christ is formed within, the hope of glory. It is His purpose that you shall be able to say with the apostle Paul, \"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me\" (Galatians 2:20). In perfect content, resting in the love of Christ, trusting the Redeemer and Life-giver to work out for you the salvation of your soul, you will know, as you draw nearer and still nearer to Him, what it means to endure the seeing of Him who is invisible. . . . The contentment that Christ bestows is a gift worth infinitely more than gold and silver and precious stones. . . .",
