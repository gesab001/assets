    "word": "I have neglected writing you for some time. I will now give my reasons. First, I had no time to write for weeks after I received Sister Arabella's kind and welcome letter, or I should have complied with her request to have answered it within two weeks. I liked the letter very much. We were all interested in the letter and hope my delay will not prevent you from answering this as soon as you read it, and I will not wait so long next time.",
