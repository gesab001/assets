    "word": "To preach the gospel means much more than many realize. It is a broad, far-reaching work. Our sanitariums have been presented to me as most efficient mediums for the promotion of the gospel message. Simple, earnest talks may be given in the parlors, pointing the sufferers to their only hope for the salvation of the (639) soul. These religious meetings should be short and right to the point, and they will prove a blessing to the hearers. The word of Him who founded the world in six days, and on the seventh \"rested and was refreshed,\" should be effectively brought before the mind. God has so clearly specified His claims upon the seventh day, that no soul need be in darkness. Jehovah regarded of such importance the knowledge of His law, of which the Sabbath commandment is a part, that He came down from heaven and on Mt. Sinai He proclaimed the ten commandments. God regards His law as a sacred thing, which it is the life of His people to obey.",
