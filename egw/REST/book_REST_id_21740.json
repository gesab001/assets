    "word": "You prepare food for those who come to the restaurant for meals, but what efforts are you putting forth to teach them the commandments of God, and point them to the path of life? The restaurant should be a place where a holy influence is exerted. Do not give your patrons merely the newspapers to read. Let them have the publications that are filled with truth. Endeavor to become acquainted with those with whom you are brought in contact. Lead them on to inquire in regard to the truth, and then have ready some tract or book that will answer their question. In this way seeds of truth may be sown, and the time will come when some of it will spring up into life eternal.",
