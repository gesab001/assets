    "word": "Well, Brother Olsen, I do not, cannot, believe it is duty for you to work on the high pressure plan. You may do this, and the more you do, the more it is considered you can do, and the lesser burdens other bear. Hold on, Bro. Olsen, put down the brakes, give yourself periods of rest and you will go forth fresh to endure another strain. But work less. For the sake of Christ who has bought you, work less. You have no right to draw from the bank until the last farthing is withdrawn. Leave a deposit, my brother. If the example of the men you mention, laborers for God who are going down into the grave, is not a sufficient rebuke to you and to me and others, please tell me what greater evidence we can have that it is duty to unload and to be careful to walk circumspectly and not presumptuously. Unload, Brother Olsen. Freshen up with periods of rest.",
