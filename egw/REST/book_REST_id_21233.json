    "word": "Now, my brother, I have a request to make of you, which is to make haste slowly. I do not want you to connect with these elements. You are a man of very set, determined traits of character, and when things go contrary to your ideas you are greatly disturbed. Your life course has been opened before me. You have had a wrestling life, and when your course has been questioned or opposed, you have been trained by course of circumstances to push just as hard to make your plans a success as that you were opposed. This element of character still exists with you, and it is a dangerous element to you and others to be brought into your religious life, because you may in some things be inclined to push when you may not have the Lord back of you to push with you. I know that the Lord can use you as His instrument, if you will be passive in His hands. He can make you a conqueror, if you are willing to submit to the light.",
