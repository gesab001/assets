    "word": "Letter 317, 1904. (To Sister Gray, Nov. 23, 1904, from San Diego, Calif.) We have been here for nearly two weeks, but I have been sick most of the time. Somewhere I caught a severe cold, and for more than a week I have not associated with the family at all, but have kept closely to my room. I have a very severe cough and a very sore throat, and I have thought it best to keep to myself. At times, when coughing, it has seemed as if my breath would stop, but I have taken heavy treatment, and I am improving, though I still have times of heavy coughing. I thank the Lord that last night I had a good night's rest, with only one spell of coughing. I feel that I am on the gaining side.",
