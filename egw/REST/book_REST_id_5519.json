    "word": "In all parts of our world experiments will be made, processes invented and methods discovered in the preparation and manufacture of healthful foods that can be used for the benefit of all the people. The all-wise God, who has given light and wisdom to one party, will not withhold His light and wisdom from others who are just as devoted to the interests of our sanitariums and all lines of medical missionary work. There are to be new food industries. Foods that are perfectly healthful and yet inexpensive are to be made, and thus the way will be opened for those to find work who, by accepting the truth, have been thrown out of employment. The Lord God of heaven will give understanding to His human agents. -Letter 192, 1901. Written July 3, 1901.",
