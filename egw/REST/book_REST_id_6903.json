    "word": "Among earth's inhabitants, scattered in every land, there are those who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Like the stars of heaven, which appear only at night, these faithful ones will shine forth when darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people. . . . In the hour of deepest apostasy, when Satan's supreme effort is made to cause \"all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\" to receive, under penalty of death, the sign of allegiance to a false rest day, these faithful ones . . . will \"shine as lights in the world.\" . . . Philippians 2:15. The darker the night, the more brilliantly will they shine.",
