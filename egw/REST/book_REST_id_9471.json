    "word": "The whole heavenly universe are intensely interested in every penitent soul that comes to Jesus; and they are interested, too, in the impenitent--in those whom they hope to see saved by repentance and reformation. Angels are watching our every act. They are familiar with every word uttered. They are intensely desirous of seeing us value above all else the instruction of God's Word. They desire us to learn Christ's meekness and lowliness--the highest of all sciences, the science of gladness and humility and love through Christ Jesus.",
