    "word": "I received your statement in reference to the royalties on books. I have not had light that there was to be a restitution of royalties according to the ideas of the writers of books. Nothing of the kind has been presented to me. There are many books written, and the publishing house would be bankrupt should those who have \n\n\n                      -2- \n\nhad books published all put in their plea. There is, and ever will be, a flood of books issued if a large remuneration is given to authors. The little story books written are not a great tax on the writers, neither are books of this character of vital consequence to the world. A difference must be made in the books written. They can not be classed together. But I will say nothing more about this. Fearing something will come in to interrupt me, I write out the most important matter first. Light has not been given me embracing that which your minds are taking in,-- going back over the ground and paying additional royalties on all the books that have been published. I answer that this is not wisdom.",
