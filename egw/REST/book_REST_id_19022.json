    "word": "The reason why our ministers are so inefficient, is that they go to their labors, and come from their labors, if they have any success, full of themselves. The disciples of Christ did this when they came and said, Even the devils are subject unto us. Jesus could discern their danger, and he said, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while--come out of the din of battle, away from the conflict, and hold communion with God. Thus it is with many workers they are too strong, too full of self. The Lord cannot lead them or teach them, or use them to his glory, for they are wise in their own conceit, and vainly imagine that the Lord cannot do without them. Self must be buried. We must educate the people to seek the Lord. We must speak plain words to ministers who are walking in the sparks of their own kindling. The praise and flattery of men make ministers hungry for more until they think . . . the praise and flattery of men of more value than the approval of God.",
