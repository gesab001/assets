    "word": "The book of nature, which spread its living lessons before them, afforded an exhaustless source of instruction and delight. On every leaf of the forest and stone of the mountains, in every shining star, in earth and sea and sky, God\u2019s name was written. With both the animate and the inanimate creation\u2014with leaf and flower and tree, and with every living creature, from the leviathan of the waters to the mote in the sunbeam\u2014the dwellers in Eden held converse, gathering from each the secrets of its life. God\u2019s glory in the heavens, the innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, \u201cthe balancings of the clouds\u201d (Job 37:16), the mysteries of light and sound, of day and night\u2014all were objects of study by the pupils of earth\u2019s first school.",
