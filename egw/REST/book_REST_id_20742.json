    "word": "The Sabbath was God's sign between Him and His people, and evidence of His kindness, mercy, and love, a token by which His people are distinguished from all false religionists of the world. And God has pledged Himself that He will bless them in their obedience, showing Himself that He is their God, and has taken them into covenant relation with Himself, and that He will fulfill His promise to all that are obedient. Not upon the first day, but upon the seventh day, God rested and was refreshed--satisfied with His work of creation. Then \"the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy,\" and now man's observance of the Lord's day of rest will again cause joy among the angels of heaven. The time in which we live is a time when the church militant will realize the oppressive power of persecution, because they keep the Sabbath of creation which God has sanctified and blessed.",
