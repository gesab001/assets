    "word": "We were delayed twelve hours because of a burnt bridge. This delay necessitated other delays which put us twenty-four hours back, and when we arrived at La Junta we were obliged to wait five hours for the train from Kansas to Denver. We heard that the cars were crowded and that every berth was taken. But Sara was on hand the moment the train stopped, and pleaded for a berth for me. There was just one berth, and she made sure of that. But it was twelve \n\n\n                                -375- \n\no'clock at night before I could lie down in my berth, and I didn't sleep until one o'clock. The rest of the party had no chance to lie down in the passenger car, and they had a hard night of it.",
