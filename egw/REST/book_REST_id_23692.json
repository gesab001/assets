    "word": "I am writing letters to Battle Creek. Will send you copies. We had a telegram that the man W. C. W., in the place of going to Portland, Oregon, was to go to Southern California, and that is all that came to us yesterday. When we shall see him now I do not imagine. I may be with him at Loma Linda before he hangs up his hat in his own home. I have not seen Loma Linda since it first opened. We are to do all we can, and then tell the Lord to open the way. I think the move we made for Loma Linda was in the right time, and they have had no embarrassment thus far in meeting their obligations. And I think the San Diego Sanitarium has no pressure except for furnishing, and they will be in this respect a little behind. They have an excellent school building in Fernando, and that school building is equal to any I have seen in this country, fully ahead of the school buildings in Battle Creek. Next, the Glendale Sanitarium: they say it is running over full all the time. We did not call for means for that sanitarium out of Southern California. And the Lord has favored us in the Loma Linda matter, by the hiring of money at five per cent interest and paying in the five thousand before it was due. Two hundred dollars was allowed them on the payments, and there is no reason why the whole can not be raised according to agreement. But I must be thankful for the advantages we have had; and we will be thankful for these three sanitariums; and the Fernando School is doing good work.",
