    "word": "I am feeling at times great weariness. I have carried heavy burdens. I have had to bear very plain testimonies to others. I have written many private testimonies to different ones, then to keep my writings up has been no little tax to me. Were you here now I would feel it duty to take some recreation--go to Yosemite and camp out, or go to some retired place and write and rest. Time seems very short to me, and I do not want to shirk responsibilities one whit. If I know what duty is, I will do it.--Letter 33a, 1880. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 7, 1986. Entire Letter.",
