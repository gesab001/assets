    "word": "If from any cause you are tired and exhausted, for Christ's sake do not attempt to give a discourse. Let another who is not thus exhausted speak, short, to the point, or else have a Bible reading; anything but sickly discourses. These will do less harm where all are believers, but when the truth is to be proclaimed before a people who are not in the faith, the speaker must prepare himself for the task. He must not ramble all through the Bible but give a connected, firm discourse, showing that he understands the points he would make. Put all your energies and soul into the work. But every discourse given when the mind is wearied is an injury to the truth. Things must and will be managed by skillful workmen, rightly dividing the words of life, that the interest will be kept up.",
