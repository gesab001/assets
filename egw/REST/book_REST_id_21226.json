    "word": "A. T. Jones, the spirit that has possessed you has been to lead souls into false paths. Only eternity will reveal what has been accomplished in the service of Satan in making souls sick with doubts. The ministry has been dishonored, greatly dishonored, and unrest has been brought in. And the Great Physician, who was waiting, longing to save to the uttermost all who would come unto Him, has been dishonored by A. T. Jones. You do not hesitate to make false statements, for Satan works your mind to utter falsehood. But now if you will be converted and live the prayer you made in Fresno that morning, as you promised to do, the Lord will work with you in the large gatherings of our people.",
