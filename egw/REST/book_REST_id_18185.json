    "word": "But this cannot be. I shall, in the fear of God, say to my brethren and sisters, Bro. Russell is not the man. You do not know him. He cannot make such an enterprise a success. I will not permit the people to meet with another disappointment in the health reform, such as they have met with. I will warn them publicly, if necessary in order to prevent this. All the mistakes and fanatical movements fall back upon me in the end. I have the most bitter letters from some, charging me with having been instrumental in the death of their friends. These friends went to extremes, and the result has been bad, and the reproach falls upon me. I wish, Bro. Russel, that you did know yourself; then you would have more rest of spirit. You feel all the time you must be doing a great and important work, when you have not the ability to perform this great work.",
