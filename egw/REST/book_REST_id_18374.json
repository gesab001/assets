    "word": "The humility that bears fruit, stirring the soul with a living sense of the love of God, will speak for the soul in that great day when everyone will be rewarded according to his works, whether they be good or evil.

His thoughts were brought into captivity to Christ. He is one with Christ.\"--Letter 21, 1897, pp. 4, 6, 9, 10. (To \"My Ministering Brethren,\" Dec. 19, 1897.)",
