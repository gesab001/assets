    "word": "The Lord would have His people a separate and peculiar people, bearing the sign and seal of the Sabbath, in preserving the memorial, the seventh day, upon which the Lord rested after His work of creation. \"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made\" [Genesis 2:3]. He gave the Sabbath to man as a day of rest, when His people might assemble to worship Him and come in close relationship with God. All heaven is interested in the worship of God's people.",
