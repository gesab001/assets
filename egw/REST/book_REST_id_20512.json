    "word": "I have been feeling very exhausted. There is an inability to think; weakness generally. I may rally after a few days' rest, but I cannot tell. I sometimes fear to cross the plains and go from a cool climate to a hot one, but what can I do? This is my study. If you were here we would go out on some excursion and camp out away from everything that would bring care. But I cannot feel like doing this at all, not for a moment, even with families, for I feel such a sadness at the thought. It would do me no good.",
