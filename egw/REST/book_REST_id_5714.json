    "word": "We left Basle Tuesday evening, October 6. There were four in our party, \u2014my son William and myself, Sister McEnterfer my attendant and stenographer, and Sister Cecilie Dahl of Christiania, who had remained after the Conference to be our guide and interpreter. We could not afford to patronize the sleeping car, which is more expensive here than in the United States, but we were very fortunate in securing a compartment to ourselves, and by the use of our blankets, were enabled to rest quite comfortably. The plan of the European car is quite favorable to a comfortable night's travel, when it is not crowded.",
