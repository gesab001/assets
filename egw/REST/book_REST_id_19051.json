    "word": "I received your two letters and have read them carefully. I was made sad, my brother, to read your letter written by your own hand. Oh, how glad I would be to comfort you, but I point you to Jesus. His invitation is given to you and to me: \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; . . . and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" Grasp this precious promise with the hand of faith and never let go. I know your difficulties and some one knows them too who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto him.",
