    "word": "I saw that as God gave His beloved sleep so He was willing they should have nourishing, strengthening food, and I saw that if S. Haskell and his wife were baptized with the third angel's message, they would see enough precious, saving truth to dwell upon, and they would not have time to dwell upon error, dangerous error, and scatter it among God's people. I saw that if God has important truth, He will give it to His people, not to two or three solitary individuals and leave all the rest of His people in darkness. The third angel is leading out a people and fitting them for translation. They are to be purified through the truth.",
