    "word": "Bro. Ginley is highly sensitive, and naturally of a quick, impulsive temper. He moves too much upon the spur of the moment. He has made efforts to correct his hasty spirit, and overcome his deficiencies, but he has a still greater effort to make. If he sees things moving wrong, he is in too great haste to tell the ones in error what he thinks, and he does not always use the most appropriate words for the occasion. He offends patients sometimes, so that they hate him, and they leave the Institute with hard feelings, to the detriment both to themselves and to the Institute. It seldom does any good to talk in a censuring manner to patients who are diseased in body and mind. But few who have moved in the society of the world, and view things from a worldling's standpoint, are prepared even to have a statement of facts in regard to themselves presented before them. The truth even is not to be spoken at all times. There is a fit time and opportunity to speak, when words will not offend. The physicians should not be overworked, and their nervous systems prostrated, for this condition of body will not be favorable to calm minds, and steady nerves, and a cheerful, happy spirit. Dr. \n                                                                           43\nGinley has been confined too steadily to the Institute. He should have had change. He should go out of Battle Creek occasionally and rest, and visit, not always making professional visits, but visits where he can be free, and where his mind will not be anxious about the sick.",
