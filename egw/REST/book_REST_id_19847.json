    "word": "Travel by Horse-drawn Wagon in Northern California, 1874- Stretching to the right and left before us was still a rapid-running, deep, broad river. We were in a quandary what to do. Your father and I unhitched the horses again. He mounted Kit's back while I had all that I could do to keep restless Bill from breaking away from me and following his mate. Your father crossed and recrossed the river twice to make sure the way of safety for the carriage. The water came above his boots. We marked the course he took by a mountain on the opposite side. We hitched our horses to the wagon the second time, at nine o'clock at night, and passed over to the other side. The water came up to the body of the wagon. We felt to thank God and to take courage. . . .",
