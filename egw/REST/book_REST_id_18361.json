    "word": "I would say to you, You are needed just where you are. Do not become restless and uneasy. Constantly improve in everything you take up. Do the work someone must do, and God's blessing will rest upon you. . . . Improve your opportunities. Learn all you can in the work in which you are engaged. The Lord knows what His people need, and through His chosen agents He manifests His benevolence to men; for He is ever working for the happiness of those who love and serve Him. . . . God desires us to find out how we may be of real service to Him. We must keep looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith. The law which He has given us to obey is the best expression of His love. His commandments perfectly obeyed, would enable families here on earth to be symbols of the family in the heavenly world. . . .",
