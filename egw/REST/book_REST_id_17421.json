    "word": "NOW, IF THERE WERE NOTHING ELSE, IT WOULD BE A QUESTION WITH THIS BOARD AS TO WHETHER IT WOULD CLEAR ITSELF FROM THE GUILT OF ROBBERY, BY HUNTING THAT THING OUT AND MAKING RESTITUTION; OR WHETHER IT WOULD LET THAT THING STAND, AND NOT SEARCH IT OUT, AND SO BE PARTAKERS IN THE ROBBERY. BUT THAT IS NOT ALL. THAT WOULD BE BAD ENOUGH, THAT THIS BOARD SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED THAT THING TO GO ON TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF HUNTING IT OUT TO THE LAST ITEM, SPENDING NIGHT AND DAY INDEED IN HUNTING THAT ROBBERY OUT, TO KNOW WHAT IT IS, TO PUT IT AWAY, AND TO MAKE RESTITUTION OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN ROBBED; BUT TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED, AND IT SURELY OUGHT NOT TO GO ON ANY MORE. THAT IS BAD; BUT STILL THERE IS MORE; THAT IS NOT THE WORST; THE SAME THINGS ARE CARRIED ON YET.",
