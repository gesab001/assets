    "word": "A large amount of the responsibility piled up in Battle Creek is not in accordance with the principles that the Lord has set before us. There should be fewer buildings erected in Battle Creek to call the crowds of people there. All these large buildings should not be crowded together as they are. They should have been placed in different localities, and not in the very midst of one city. The various cities should have representative of the truth in their midst. I can not go contrary to the will of God, and say, erect more buildings \n\n\n                                     -100- \n\nin Battle Creek; but I would say, build in other localities. There should be fewer interests centered at Battle Creek, and far more in other places where there is nothing to give character to the work of God.",
