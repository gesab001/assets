    "word": "Oh, if the world could only know this perilous fact, and turn away from the course which they are pursuing!  How shortsighted is the policy that is being brought in by the rulers in the land to restore to the man of sin his lost ascendancy!  They are manifesting wonderful zeal in taking this spurious sabbath under the care and protection of their legislatures; but they know not what they are doing. They are placing upon a false sabbath divine honors, and when this is fully done, persecution will break forth upon those who observe the Sabbath that God gave in Eden as a memorial of His creative power. Then the commandment of men will be clothed with sacred garments, and will be pronounced holy.--Ms 15, 1896, pp. 14, 15. (\"Revelation,\" April 27, 1896.)",
