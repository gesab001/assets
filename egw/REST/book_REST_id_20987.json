    "word": "Thus educate the children and youth to pray, teach the children how to repent. The time taken up in so large a school in reading reports ought to be occupied every moment in the very best kind of solid instruction. Lead out the minds by making interesting remarks. Tell them to seek God, and make the service of Christ full of attraction, tell them it is in vain to think they can make themselves better and promise to amend, for this will not remove one spot or stain of sin but impress upon their minds that they must not only repent and forsake sin, but the way to obtain a sense of sin and true repentance is to cast themselves just as they are upon the declared mercy and revealed love of God. This would not be presumption, for every ray of light comes to them from the throne of God. It is the duty of teachers and ministers to guard against ideas that lead to presumption and confidence that cannot be sustained by the Word of God, to feel safe for eternity when they are not safe.",
