    "word": "The truth is one. It will take people from France and Italy and, mingling them with other elements, soften and refine them through the truth. Teach them that in humility and union there is strength. The love of Christ \n\n\n                                  -358- \n\nand living faith would have a transforming power upon the man, upon his ideas, upon his character. The temper and the life experience will be softened and ennobled by divine truth. The influence of the truth is to take away from man that which is impetuous and rebellious, and bring him into harmony with heaven. God's purpose is to bring all into harmony and unity on the platform of truth as it is in Jesus. There are to be no separate interests formed or maintained by the believer in present truth.",
