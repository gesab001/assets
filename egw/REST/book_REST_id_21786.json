    "word": "If our ministers go into a place and first come to the shepherds of the flock, and are friendly and sociable and kind with them, it may have an excellent effect upon them, and leave a favorable impression in regard to the truth, upon their minds. At any rate it is fair and right to give them an opportunity to be favorable and kind if they will. If by earnest, prayerful, Christlike efforts you can bring one minister into the truth, [you through his influence may be able] to convert a score of souls. We have not one point of truth that we need be ashamed of, and therefore we should be perfectly fair and open in laying these things before those who are intelligent and who are in responsible positions. Treat them as honest men. You can speak with them in regard to matters of general religious interest, perhaps seeking information on some points, without coming directly and pointedly to the subject of the truth itself. Leave that for another interview. To have the wisdom of a serpent and the harmlessness of a dove, is a very wonderful acquirement.",
