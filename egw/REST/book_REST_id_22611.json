    "word": "Christ came to our world to restore the moral image of God in men; but the men who have had great light have given themselves over to Satan. They have worked out his plans in introducing tobacco, liquor and opium into foreign, heathen lands. And these things have been recognized by the intelligent heathen as a deadly evil that leads to all kinds of violence and crime, and stirs up the savage elements to delight in war. Thus ungovernable propensities are perpetuated, making it almost hopeless to send missionaries among them. And the heathen hate the white man for this kind of work.",
