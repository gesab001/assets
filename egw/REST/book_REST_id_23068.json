    "word": "Creating A False Appetite \n\n     Every part of the work is to be carried forward solidly. When large, expensive preparations are made in connection with the public effort made in cities, these preparations may at first attract a large number of people. But they cannot be maintained for any length of time. It is found, however when an effort is made to dispense with them, that they have created an appetite for such things, and that they cannot be dispensed with without a falling off in interest and in the number of hearers.",
