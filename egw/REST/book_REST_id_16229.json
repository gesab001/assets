    "word": "Man does not build himself into a habitation for the Spirit, but unless there is a cooperation of man's will with God's will, the Lord can do nothing for him. The Lord is the great Master Worker, and yet the human agent must cooperate with the Divine Worker, or the heavenly building cannot be completed. All the power is of God, and all the glory is to redound to God, and yet all the responsibility rests with the human agent; for God can do nothing without the cooperation of man.--Review and Herald, Oct. 25, 1892.",
