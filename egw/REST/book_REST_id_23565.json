And this gave the Review and Herald opportunity to do a generous work in behalf of the Battle Creek School. If the work of selling \"Christ's Object Lessons\" had not been taken up, there would scarcely have been a hope that the debt of the Battle Creek College to the Review Office would ever have been paid. From the light given me by the Lord, I know that he will be displeased if the Review and Herald is in any way exacting in dealing with those who are trying to release our schools from debt. As those in the Review and Herald see their brethren struggling to free the schools debt, they are to cooperate with them. Those who have charge of this work have carried a heavy burden. Nothing could have been done without earnest effort and determined vigilance. And nothing else could have done that which \"Christ's Object Lessons\" have done to bring relief to the schools.",
