    "word": "Fears are expressed of danger, because of the wind, in crossing the Dale Creek Bridge--650 feet long and 126 feet high. . . . This trestle bridge looks like a light, frail thing to bear so great weight. But fears are not expressed because of the frail bridge, but in regard to the tempest of wind, so fierce that we fear the cars may be blown from the track. In the providence of God the wind decreased. Its terrible wail is subdued to pitiful sobs and sighs, and we passed safely over the dreaded bridge. We reached the summit. The extra engine was removed. . . . No steam is required at this point to forward the train, for the down grade is sufficient for us to glide swiftly along.",
