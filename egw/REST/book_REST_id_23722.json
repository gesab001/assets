    "word": "There have been plenty of discouraging words spoken regarding the work at Madison, and compared with the importance of the work, very little help has been given. When I have heard words calculated to discourage the workers at Madison, I have felt it my duty to say to the workers there, Have courage in the Lord, and do your best. And in the results that have attended their efforts, the Lord has given evidence that his blessing has rested upon their labors. It has been demonstrated that at the Madison School an all-round education can be given that will fit the students for efficient work in other fields.",
