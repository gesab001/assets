    "word": "If we can bear the manifestations of His gracious power, He will surely bestow upon us all we can wisely handle. It is because we are so weak that we cannot bear the power of the grace of God, that we do not receive greater manifestations from above. We are ready to appropriate the glory to our unworthy selves. If we have prosperity we get exalted and think it is because of our own merits that God favors us, and then He lets us drop into temptation and leaves us to wrestle with doubts, perplexities, and darkness, that we may have a correct view of the Source of our strength and our entire dependence upon Jesus Christ.",
