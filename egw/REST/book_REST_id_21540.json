    "word": "Public Exposure of a Worker's Mistakes \n     We are to direct the weapons of our warfare against our foes, but never turn them toward those who are under marching orders from the King of kings, \n                                                                           38\nwho are fighting manfully the battles of the Lord of lords. Let no one aim at a soldier whom God recognizes, whom God has sent forth to bear a special message to the world and to do a special work. The soldiers of Christ may not always reveal perfection in their step, but their mistakes should call out from their fellow-comrades not words that will weaken, but words that will strengthen, and will help them to recover their lost ground. They should not turn the glory of God into dishonor, and give an advantage to the bitterest foes of their King.",
