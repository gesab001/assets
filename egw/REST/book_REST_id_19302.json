    "word": "June 20: I slept the first part of the night, but during the latter part I could not rest. I committed my case to the Lord, and was comforted by the thought that I am a subject of His care. I do find peace and comfort in prayer, but I should look upon it as a great blessing from the Lord if I could pass the hours of the night in sleep. These words comfort and strengthen me: [2 Corinthians 4:16; Ephesians 4:23; Philippians 2:5, quoted]. . . .",
