    "word": "Counsel to a Possessive Leader--While you have too much to do, others have too little.  You do not give others an opportunity to improve in efficiency by practical experience.  You are willing to be helped and assisted, if your helpers will leave the main responsibility resting on you.  Especially among your own countrymen you desire to be placed above every one else.",
