    "word": "The Lord does not press on anyone burdens too heavy to be borne. He estimates every weight before He allows it to rest upon the hearts of those who are laborers together with Him. To every one of His workers our loving heavenly Father says: \"Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee\" (Psalm 55:22). Let the burden bearers believe that He will carry every load, great or small.",
