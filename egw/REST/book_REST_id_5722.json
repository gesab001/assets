    "word": "The scenery of Denmark is unlike that of Germany. The surface is an almost unbroken plain, in most places but a few feet above the level of the sea. Some parts, indeed, are hilly, but it is said that if the sea level were one hundred feet higher, more than half the country would be covered with water. The fine forests with which Denmark was once adorned have decayed or been cut down. The land is mostly divided into small farms, the possession of a few acres being the summit of a Danish farmer's ambition. Formerly the greater part of the country was owned by the nobility, but during the present century the peasants or farmers have had an opportunity to buy the land, and thus have become an independent class of society. To us this country wears a more familiar aspect than Germany. The fences separating the fields, the farm-houses dotted over the landscape, and the pretty beech groves, remind us of some parts of the United States.",
