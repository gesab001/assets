    "word": "It is too late now to cling to worldly treasures. Soon unnecessary houses and lands will be of no benefit to anyone, for the curse of God will rest more and more heavily upon the earth. The call comes, \"Sell that ye have, and give alms\" [Luke 12:33]. This message should be faithfully borne--urged home to the hearts of the people--that God's own property may be returned to Him in offerings to advance His work in the world.--16MR 348 (1901).",
