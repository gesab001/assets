    "word": "Christ came into the world to \"bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.\" \"The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings.\" The world is full of men and women who are carrying a heavy burden of sorrow and suffering and sin. God sends His children to reveal to them Him who will take away the burden and give them rest. It is the mission of Christ's servants to help, to bless, and to heal. \n\n\n                     - 28 -",
