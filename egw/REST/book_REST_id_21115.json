    "word": "MR No. 1451 - A Visit to Monterey; Advice on Family Matters\n\n     (Written June 12, 1863, from Monterey, Michigan, to \"Dear Friends at Home.\") \n\n\n     We arrived here safe the same evening we left home. A part of the road was very rough, and where it was sandy it was as good as it ever was. But the journey nearly used me up. James stood it well and attended meeting the same evening. Preached twice yesterday. We meant to stop at Otsego, but we feared a storm. The next day we expected to stop at the doctor's, but they had all left for the meeting, so we did not stop anywhere until we arrived at Monterey. At noon we stopped in the old spot to feed the horses and to eat our lunch. Sabbath morning I was lame and sick with cold. Sister Jones packed me, and I felt better and went to meeting. There is quite an interest here, but Brother Lay is waiting for this letter and I must draw to a close.",
