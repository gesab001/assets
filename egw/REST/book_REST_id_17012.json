    "word": "When Bro. Palmer gives a sum to the cause of God, he is inclined to think his duty done. But there is a work which will come closer to Bro. and sister Palmer than this. It is to cultivate courteousness, and liberality of thought and feeling in the little transactions of life. It is in their deal to have others' interest in view as well as their own. It is to be liberal daily, and study to make others happy, instead of living for themselves. Practical, daily self-denial, and cross-bearing, must be practiced if we follow Christ. Both Bro. and sister Palmer have lessons to learn in this direction before they can be true followers of Christ. Love one another, as I have loved you, is the command of Christ. Sister Palmer has no experience in this direction. She has a cold, unsympathizing nature, which must be transformed, before she can be worthy to be numbered with that throng who have come up through great tribulation, and who have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Bro. and sister Palmer, you have the work of washing \n                                                                           51\nto do, to remove the defects from your robes of character. No one can do this for you, and you cannot stand with the spotless throng, unless you do this work. These infirmities are natural to sister Palmer. Her selfishness has grown with her growth, and strengthened with her strength, until it is interwoven with every fibre of her being. Nothing but the blood of Christ can remove this deep-rooted evil. Bro. Palmer has been more or less affected by his wife, and molded by her spirit. He has seen her failures to some extent, but he has thought that it was no use to labor with her in regard to these things, and finally has become affected in the same way.",
