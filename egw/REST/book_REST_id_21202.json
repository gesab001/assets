    "word": "A large flat stone was shown us in which were distinct specimens of fish and curious leaves. The proprietor told us [that] on a previous trip he had brought these two large rocks on horseback eight miles. The rock did not look so far, but he said that was the distance to get access to it. There were in these split off slabs of rock, feathers of birds and other curiosities, which were plainly to be seen. We look with curious interest upon rocks composed of sandstone in perfectly horizontal strata containing most interesting remains. These rocks assume most curious and fantastic shapes, as if chiseled out by the hand of art.",
