    "word": "MR No. 1440 - Look Constantly to Jesus; Follow His Example; Reflect His Character; Work in His Lines\n\n     (Written September 18, 1894, to \"Dear Children,\" from Norfolk Villa, Prospect St., Granville, N.S.W.) \n\n\n     I arose and dressed at midnight, for I could sleep no longer. The hands of my watch stood at twelve o'clock. Since writing my last letter to you, the Vancouver mail has come in, and I read your letter with much interest. I am sorry that anyone in the Office should reenact transactions after a similar kind to those which were done during your father's sickness, and for which they were reproved. But let not anything of this character cut off your faith. Do not permit feelings to arise that will destroy your faith and happiness. Walk humbly with God, walk trustingly.",
