    "word": "Our company were thirsty for water which could only be obtained from the river. My imagination saw the \"pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.\" On either side of this river was the tree of life \"which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations\" (Revelation 22:1, 2). The Great Shepherd was leading His flock to living fountains of water and to green pastures, new and delightful scenery opening continually before His people. Heaven, sweet heaven, the saints' eternal home, the abode for the toilers, where the weary who have borne the heavy burdens through life find rest, peace, and joy! They sowed in tears, they reap with joy and triumph. Heaven is a home where sympathy is alive in every heart, expressed in every look. Love reigns there. There are no jarring elements, no discord or contentions or war of words.",
