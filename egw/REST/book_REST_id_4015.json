    "word": "When children lose their self-control and speak passionate words, the parents should for a time keep silent. . . . Silence is golden, and will do more to bring repentance than any words that can be uttered. Satan is well pleased when parents irritate their children by speaking harsh, angry words. . . . \"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.\" Colossians 3:21. . . . Let your calmness help to restore them to a proper frame of mind.",
