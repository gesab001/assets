    "word": "Chapter on Time of Trouble.--We have just read the matter in regard to the time of trouble. Brother Smith thinks that chapter by no means should be left out of Volume 4. He says there is not a sentence in it that is not essentially needed. This seemed to make a very deep impression upon his mind and I thought I would write to you in reference to this matter. I have read it and it has just a thrilling power with it. I see nothing that will exclude it from the book for general sale among unbelievers. [THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED BY THE PACIFIC PRESS IN LATE SEPTEMBER, 1884, AND GAINED FAVORABLE NOTICE: \"THE GREAT CONTROVERSY, VOL. IV: THIS VOLUME, SO LONG LOOKED FOR, IS NOW OUT. AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL MORE THAN MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE WHO HAVE ANXIOUSLY WAITED FOR IT. WE JUDGE FROM OUR OWN READING OF IT; WE FOUND THE CONTENTS OF DEEPER INTEREST THAN OUR IMAGINATION COULD HAVE REACHED.\"--SIGNS OF THE TIMES, OCT. 2, 1884,--COMPILERS.] --Letter 59, 1884.",
