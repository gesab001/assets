    "word": "God is the one who orders all things. Have you not had any idea that this movement made by Brother Hickox was under the ordering of God? Did not the Lord see that you might not deal with his servant wisely? Did he not see that he needed to do service in some other part of his vineyard, just where he is? He who is the orderer of all things, he who numbers the hairs of our head, worked through his Spirit to transfer him to a field where he could do greater good, just as the careful, tender, earthly father would do in the interests of his children; only our God is infinitely more watchful over the interests of his sons and his daughters. He is too wise to err, and too good to do them harm. He has a wise love, a great and unbounded love. \"Are ye not of more value than many sparrows? and yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.\"",
