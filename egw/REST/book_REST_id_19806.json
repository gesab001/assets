    "word": "The light was given me eighteen years ago [1881] that there would be great losses because there was so little close, thorough instruction given to students in bookkeeping, keeping accounts. The Lord would have nothing go at haphazard, and the result show, as today, mountains of debt and no way to get out of them. If the advice had been followed that the Lord has given, to have bookkeeping taught and practiced, there would be at this time men of wisdom that could stand in the position to go from place to place, review all account books, and then instruct in the school, interest the scholars, and make this a portion of the students' lessons.--Letter 166a, 1899, p. 1.
