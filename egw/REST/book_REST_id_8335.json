    "word": "7: Filing System\n \n\n     The importance of a filing system to any speaker or writer is best demonstrated, not by what Mrs. White said about it, but by what she did about it. The following three quotations were not written by her, but taken from her biography. The first two were written by her son, W. C. White, the third by her grandson, Arthur White.\n \n\n     Ellen White's writings were filed and indexed during her Australian years.--For some months Sister Peck has devoted a portion of her time to sorting, filing, reading, and indexing all of Mother's manuscripts within our reach, and Mother has been looking over her old diaries and manuscripts that were never copied on the typewriter. In these she finds many precious things that are being copied, filed, and indexed with the rest.--4BIO 451.",
