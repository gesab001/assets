    "word": "186\n     Debating ministers are the most unreliable among us, because they cannot be depended upon when the work goes hard.

They depend as much upon being enlivened and invigorated by the excitement created by debate or opposition, as does the inebriate upon his dram. These ministers need to be converted anew. They need to drink deep of the unceasing streams which proceed from the eternal Rock.",
