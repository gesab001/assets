    "word": "While so many are saying, Who is the Lord, that I should serve Him? while there prevails a lack of faith in God, let those who represent the work of the third angel's message act like converted men. Let them wrestle with God in prayer. When our men in official positions are fully converted, they will advocate the truth for this time in every line of their work. I am hoping that we may have the satisfaction of seeing a work done that is free from selfishness and that will rapidly advance work in missionary lines.",
