    "word": "Wrote on Sufferings of Christ \n     [Washington, Iowa] Saturday, June 21, 1873. A beautiful day; rather warm. Took a pack. Felt better. Wrote fifteen pages on sufferings of Christ. I became much interested in my subject. Brother Wheeler, Hester, and Brother Van Ostrand went to the meeting. We had some prospect of rain. Called the family together and read the matter I had written. All seemed interested.--Ms 8, 1873, p. 7. (Diary, June 1 to 30, 1873.)",
