    "word": "I have something to write in regard to the school interest. \"Christ's Object Lessons,\" in accordance with the Lord's instructions, was donated to \n\n\n                                   -407- \n\nour schools for the special purpose of releasing them from debt. And this gave the Review and Herald opportunity to do a generous work in behalf of the Battle Creek school. If the work of selling \"Christ's Object Lessons\" had not been taken up, there would scarcely have been a hope that the debt of the Battle Creek College to the Review Office would ever have been paid. From the light given me by the Lord, I know that He will be displeased if the Review and Herald is in any way exacting in dealing with those who are trying to release our schools from debt. As those in the Review and Herald see their brethren struggling to free the schools from debt, they are to cooperate with them. . . .",
