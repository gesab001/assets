    "word": "A Wrong and Right Use of Inspired Counsel [ADDRESSED TO MR. GARMIRE.--COMPILERS.] \n\n\n     My brother, you have been deceived yourself, and have deceived others. You have not searched the Scriptures in the right way. You must search them to learn the mind of God, not to prove your theory. You read the Word of God in the light of your own views. You build up a false structure, and then barricade it with texts which you claim prove it to be true; but you pass over those passages which prove it to be untrue. You say, \"The Bible is my foundation of faith.\" But is it? I answer, The Bible does not sustain your position. Again you say, \"Show me by the Bible that I am wrong, and I will give up my views.\" But how can you be convinced by the Bible as long as you wrest and misapply its utterances? By so doing you cut off the only source by which God might reach and convict you.",
