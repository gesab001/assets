    "word": "The apostle brings in another figure: \"Ye are God's building\" (verse 9)--an edifice to be erected. The construction of a building calls for skill in using the timber which God has caused to grow for the happiness and blessing of man. The Lord has provided the forest trees, and now man must use the trees. They must be cut down and prepared by saw, and axe, and wedge, and hammer, to be fitted for the building. . . .",
