    "word": "MR No. 679 - Unity in Diversity Among SDA's\n\n     We are not to feel that we must speak the very same things, giving the same representation in the same words, and yet there is to be unity in the diversity. All the different testimonies unite to form one whole, as the books of the Bible are brought together, and bound under one cover. . . . One must not labor to have everything that comes from his mind entirely different from that which comes from another man's mind. But he is to follow in the line where the Spirit of the Lord shall direct, then there will be different figures and different ways of presentation, that will interest and educate different minds.--Letter 53, 1900, p. 2. (To S. N. Haskell, April 5, 1900.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. January 16, 1979",
