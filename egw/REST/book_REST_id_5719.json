    "word": "In this densely populated country, every foot of available land has been cultivated for centuries. Wherever the country is too barren and mountainous for other uses, and there are rivers to furnish means of transportation, it is devoted to the raising of forests. In many places where in former times the forests had been destroyed, they have been replanted at the public expense. In many States they are the property of the government, and are as carefully kept as gardens. There are laws prohibiting even private owners from wasting their forests without regard to the public good.",
