    "word": "Some of these houses are very nice and expensive. Just before me is a large, fine house, built high on the top of the mountain. A wall of masonry several feet high bears up the front of the house, while the back of the house rests upon the solid ledge drilled and chiseled out for the builders. A very nicely furnished barn is built in the same manner. In stepping out of the house there is not a level place for the feet to stand upon unless built up like a platform.",
