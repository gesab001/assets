    "word": "My dear Son Edson, I am deeply interested in your experience, and I hope you will trust in the Lord continually. I hope you will not allow your feelings to control you. God has given you a work to do; be faithful to your Redeemer. God can open the way before you, he can place your feet in safe paths,  and lead you on to victory. We want to understand daily the meaning of these words: \"Turned to God.\" Here are true holiness, rest and peace, grace and glory. Turn not to any living man to be your helper. Tell everything to Jesus. He knows all the bearings, all the results of every purpose and every plan. His wisdom is unerring, and He has given evidence how much He loves His purchased possession, and how willing, how gratified He is to help His children, to guide them in judgment. My God shall supply all your need, according to His riches in glory by Jesus Christ.",
