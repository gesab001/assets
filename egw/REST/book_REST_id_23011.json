    "word": "(1024) The people are hungering and thirsting for help from heaven. I have tried to put in practice these principles of self-sacrifice, and I know whereof I speak when I say that \n\n\n                              -619- \n\nthe blessing of God will rest upon you when you make the call of duty first. I am glad for this privilege of testifying before you this morning that the Lord has turned matters, over and over again, in such a way as to give us more than we could possibly ask for. The Lord will prove His servants; and if they prove true to Him, and leave their cases with Him, He will help them in every time of need.",
