    "word": "Visit to Northern Italy\n     Weary and worn from the arduous labors of our northern trip, I would gladly have rested a few weeks in our home at Basle. But the next morning after our arrival, the brethren presented the necessity of a speedy visit to Italy, as some there were becoming discouraged, and were in great need of help. Arrangements were therefore made to start the next Thursday morning, less than a week from the time we reached home.",
