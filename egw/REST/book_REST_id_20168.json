Butler and \"the Burden-bearers in the Southern Field) \n\n\n     Workers for God will meet with turmoil, discomfort, and weariness. At times, uncertain and distracted, the heart is almost in despair. When this restless nervousness comes, the worker should stop and rest. Christ invites him, \"Come . . . apart, . . . and rest awhile\" [Mark 6:31]. \"He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might He increaseth strength. . . . They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint\" [Isaiah 40:29, 31].",
