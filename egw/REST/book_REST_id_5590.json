    "word": "Toiling Mothers. \n     639. The mother, in many cases previous to the birth of her children, is permitted to toil early and late, heating her blood. . . . Her strength should have been tenderly cherished. . . . Her burdens and cares are seldom lessened, and that period, which should be to her of all others a time of rest, is one of fatigue, sadness, and gloom. By too great exertion on her part, she deprives her offspring of that nutrition which nature has provided for it, and by heating her own blood, she imparts to the child a bad quality of blood. The offspring is robbed of its vitality, robbed of physical and mental strength.--H. to L., Chap. 2, p. 33.",
