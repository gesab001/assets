    "word": "I have been instructed that God will work upon human minds, and will give to men in various places ability to produce health foods. By His Holy Spirit the Lord will guide His workers in the preparation of foods, and improvements will constantly be made. The profits on these foods are to be used for the good of suffering humanity everywhere, as cases may require. The income from the foods is not to be confined to the use of the sanitariums. There are other interests that will need to be sustained.",
