    "word": "Recently we have purchased what is known as the Loma Linda property. This property is sixty miles from Los Angeles, and is on the main railway line from Los Angeles to New Orleans. It was owned by a corporation of one hundred and fifty people, seventy of whom were physicians. But the physicians did not agree among themselves, and the place lost money instead of making it, and it was decided to sell. It continued to be a loss financially, and the stockholders became anxious to sell. It \n\n\n                                     -260- \n\nwas offered for forty thousand dollars, and for this price our brethren have purchased it, paying down five thousand dollars. They will make three other payments of five thousand each, and after that will have three years in which to pay the remainder, at six percent interest.",
