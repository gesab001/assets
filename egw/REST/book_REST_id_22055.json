    "word": "It is not the most important part of an enterprise to erect a building in which to treat the sick; there is still a necessity of securing wise, competent discreet managers, and of securing proper facilities to make a complete success of the institution. In our experience with the Sanitarium and the Health Retreat we have learned how difficult a thing it is to secure all these essential things. It takes years to equip an institution and to place it in good running order. We cannot find everywhere men like Dr. Kellogg to manage such institutions. It is a heavy load for some one to carry to undertake the management of an \n                                                                           232\nenterprise like that and make it a success. This affair in Mount Vernon seems still more unadvised when you see what a great demand there is for both men and means in matters of vital interest connected with the cause of truth. There are new fields opening up on every aide. Not only from home but also from foreign fields, the Macedonian cry is heard \"come over and help us.\" Would it be wise to allow this enterprise in Mount Vernon to cripple other and more important branches of the work? Is God pleased with such inventions? Is it in his order that this institution has been brought into existence to consume means and time and to perplex the servants of God, hindering them from working for the salvation of souls, when there is already an institution to do the work for which this has professedly been established. If such an institution is not run wisely, it will only work against the truth.",
