    "word": "Our camp meeting at Adelaide, South Australia, was a success. There was a much larger interest than we had at Armadale, a year ago. You know we had an excellent interest in that place. Sabbath and Sundays the crowd was much larger at Adelaide than at Armadale. The opposition was much stronger, chiefly from two persons, one who professed to be a converted Jew, and the other a Disciple minister named Green. These men stormed and fumed and raved like two madmen. They challenged our ministers to enter into controversy with them, but our answer to them was, \"We are doing a great work, and we cannot come down.\" The fact that we would not turn aside to enter into controversy with them, made them almost frantic. They showed what manner of spirit they were of, and the people had an opportunity of seeing the contrast between those who keep the commandments of God, and those who disregard them. \n\n\n                                  -352-",
