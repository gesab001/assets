    "word": "My dear brother, I freely forgive you, as you request, and I am so very thankful that you do see and do understand the error of the past. No error is of the truth, and no error will have an influence to sanctify the soul, and I am so thankful that it is not too late for wrongs to be righted. We have a sin pardoning Saviour, one who will ever be touched with the feelings of our infirmities. I am deeply constrained day and night for the sheep that have \n                                                                           1193\nstrayed from the fold. As I read the parable of our Lord, I am astonished that it does not have more weight with every soul who is interestedly trying to do the will of our heavenly Father. I know from the light given me, that many who are now indifferent and careless and reckless who have strayed from the fold, and some have been recklessly and unfeelingly thrust out of the fold to perish in the wilderness. O how my heart aches to see so few going in search of the lost sheep. It is the business of every laborer together, to make this a special work, to put forth special effort to seek and find the lost sheep, and not wait for them to find the Shepherd. All heaven is watching this phase of the work, ready to co-operate with the human agent who shall consider who are, and where are the lost sheep, those who once loved the truth but have strayed away from the fold.",
