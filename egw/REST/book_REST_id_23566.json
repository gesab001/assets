    "word": "God has wrought in a wonderful manner through \"Christ's Object Lessons\". Let not selfishness reach out the hand to spoil the pattern. The Review and Herald have profited by the work which has been done to raise the debt on the Battle Creek School. Let those in the Review and Herald remember that their brethren, who have labored so earnestly in behalf of the schools, deserve the favors God designs them to have as they seek to establish the school in a more favorable locality. Let not those in the Review and Herald Office think that they will do God Service by binding about the school interests.",
