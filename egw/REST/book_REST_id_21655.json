    "word": "This same King is sending forth His servants today. He is inviting His guests, saying, \"Come, for all things are now ready.\" The Lord of the marriage \n\n\n                                      -7- \n\nis soon coming: behold, He is at the door. Delay not to open the door, lest He turn away from receiving you and you enter not into the marriage feast. Open the door and receive the Master, that you may enter into the mansions of everlasting rest and never fading glory prepared for all those that love Him. Who will make ready for the coming of Him who hath said, \"Behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give to every man according as his work shall be\" [Revelation 22:12].",
