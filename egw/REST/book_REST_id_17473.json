    "word": "How Hearts Become Hardened \n\n     There has been a sad departure from right principles. The Word of God declares that God hardened the heart of Pharaoh. This was done when, giving Pharaoh warnings and revealing God's miraculous power before him, he braced himself up to resist the light, and refused to acknowledge the Monarch of heaven and yield to His requirements. Every time that Pharaoh resisted the Spirit of God his heart grew harder and more difficult to impress, until the restraining influence of the Spirit of God was removed. Pharaoh sowed continually the seeds of obstinacy, and he reaped obstinacy, and he kept up his determined spirit of obstinacy till he perished in the Red Sea.",
