    "word": "These words contain the science of Christianity. They show us how we may obtain an insurance policy to the life that measures with the life of God. Let us cultivate the precious graces of the Spirit. Let us use the talent of speech aright, speaking only words that will bless and strengthen those who hear. Let us crucify self, that in our hearts may grow up a strong love for Christ and for one another. Let us bring into the daily experience the instruction contained in the thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians. Believers must bring into their lives a stronger love for one another, a growing interest in one another.",
