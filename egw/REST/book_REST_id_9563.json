    "word": "Maintaining Personal Tidiness \n\nDear Brother Robert and Sister Hannah [Sawyer]: \n     I have received your letter, and will now reply. Lest I may have been misunderstood, I will say that I never intended that any counsel I have given you in the past should influence you against making any move that would be for your best interests.  I have nothing to say to hinder your investing your means in any place where you could have better accommodations or advantages than you have where you now are.",
