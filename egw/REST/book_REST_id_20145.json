    "word": "It is not emotion that we need, but a living faith in the living word of a living Saviour, a Saviour who was crucified for us and who proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" He wants us to live His principles. But there are those in positions of responsibility here today who do not appreciate these principles. They have been tested and tried. A change must be made. Let them have an opportunity to get out into the field and see what it means to wrestle for the cause as some of God's servants have wrestled. Let them see what it means to build up the work, what it means to establish something out of apparently nothing. Then they will understand that it is God's desire that His servants shall be linked together, that every part of His work shall be connected with every other part, all being joined together by the golden links of heavenly unity.",
