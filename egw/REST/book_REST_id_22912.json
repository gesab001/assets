    "word": "(615) In training workers to care for the sick, let the minds of the students be impressed with the thought that their highest aim, should always be to look after the spiritual welfare of their patients. To this end they should learn to repeat the promises of God's word, and to offer fervent prayers daily, while preparing for service. Let them realize that they \n\n\n                              -345- \n\nare always to keep the sweetening, sanctifying influence of the great Medical Missionary before their patients. If those who are suffering can be impressed with the fact that Christ is their sympathizing, compassionate Saviour, they will have rest of mind, which is so essential to the recovery of health.-- Unpub.
