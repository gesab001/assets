    "word": "It is not the work of either of you to follow your own ideas as superintendent or manager. Your disrespect to the board, your chafing under the proper restraint of appointed counsellors, is born of the temperament of the man, not of sound, sensible reason.

I am so very sorry that one connected with you as a physician should venture to expend even one dollar without the approval of those who should be your counsellors. But this is the result of your precept and example.",
