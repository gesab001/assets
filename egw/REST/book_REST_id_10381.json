Colossians 2:6-8.  {ExV 36.11} \n     Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.  {ExV 36.12} \n     For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  {ExV 36.13} \n     For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.  {ExV 36.14} \n     Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  {ExV 36.15} \n     But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

Hebrews 4:10-12.  {ExV 36.19} \n     Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:",
