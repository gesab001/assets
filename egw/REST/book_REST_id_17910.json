    "word": "Our aged father Lamson has his affections upon the things of this earth when they should be removed, and he ripening up for Heaven. The life that he now lives should he live by faith on the Son of God. His affections should be on the better land. He should have less and less interest in the perishable treasures of earth, while eternal things, which are of the greatest consequence, should engage the whole man. The days of his probation are nearly ended. Oh, how little time remains to devote to God. His energies are worn, his mind broken, and at best his services must be weak, yet if given heartily and fully, are wholly acceptable to him. With your age, Bro. Lamson, has come an increase of selfishness, and a more firm, earnest love for the treasures of this poor world.",
