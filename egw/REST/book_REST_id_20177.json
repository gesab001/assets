    "word": "If you had taken hold of your Sabbath History and made that your principal but not exclusive business, but labored a portion of the time to keep up other branches of the work, it would have been better for the interests of the cause of God.

But while you are going so thorough and covering so much ground, you are not getting out a work calculated to do the greatest amount of good by awakening a general interest. Minds become weary in reading and following you. When you get engaged in matter that you are now at work upon, you scarcely know where to stop.",
