    "word": "In the cause of God, Christ's Spirit and manner of working are to be carried out in every particular. Mercy and justice will be the ruling principles where Christ abides. In order to be qualified for their positions of trust, men who are connected with the work of God, must be Christ like in all their dealings with each other. These principles we have labored to have maintained from the very first in our Publishing Association. We have had to fight the battle over and over with men connected with the Publishing Association. This is God's institution, and we prize it too highly to allow one blot or stain to rest upon this instrumentality, if we can do or say anything to prevent it.",
