    "word": "\"God is love\" is written upon every opening bud, upon every spire of springing grass. The lovely birds making the air vocal with their happy songs, the delicately tinted flowers in their perfection perfuming the air, the lofty trees of the forest with their rich foliage of living green-- all testify to the tender, fatherly care of our God and to His desire to make His children happy.--SC 9, 10 (1892).",
