    "word": "Christians, is Christ revealed in us? We must labor to have sound bodies and strong minds, that are not easily enfeebled, minds that look beyond self to the cause and result of every movement made. Then we are in a fair way to endure \n\n\n                      -22- \n\nhardness as good soldiers. We need minds that can see difficulties and go through with them with the wisdom that comes from God; that can wrestle with hard problems and conquer them. The hardest problem is to crucify self, to endure hardness in spiritual experience, training the soul by severe discipline. This will not, perhaps, bring the very best satisfaction at the first, but the after-effect will be peace and happiness.",
