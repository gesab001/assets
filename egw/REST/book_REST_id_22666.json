    "word": "There is much work to be done in and around Newcastle and Maitland, and we feel that the next camp meeting in New South Wales should be held between Maitland and Newcastle, or in East Maitland.

It may be well, where the opposition has been very bitter, to hold two camp meetings in one place. Let the ministers exhaust their opposition, and then let the truths which they have misstated and misinterpreted be presented again in the Spirit and power of God.",
