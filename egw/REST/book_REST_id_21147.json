    "word": "We left our spring wagon because the road was so rough we could go no farther. We rode about two miles when Willie called us to come back. Mr. Walling had broken down. We rode back and saw that the axletree of the wagon was broken, and we must make camp where we were. We rested a while and Mr. Walling took his three horses and the spring wagon back and was to send us the axletree or bring it Wednesday. We made a very comfortable camp and had plenty of bedding. The nights are very cold. There is ice on the water and the ground nearly freezes nights.",
