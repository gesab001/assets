    "word": "MR No. 207 - Manuscript Materials Requested for Use in Books and Articles\n\n     My much respected brother in the Lord, I am afflicted as I learn of your affliction. . . . You have the pledged word of Jehovah, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" . . . I have evidence the very best, that God loves you. He will not thrust you from Him in your weakness, for He loves you. Do not worry yourself out of the arms of Jesus, but just repose in restful quietude in His love. . . . In the weak state of your body, the enemy may try to make his voice heard that the Lord does not love you. . . . The cloud may appear dark to you at times in itself, but when filled with the bright light of Jesus, it is turned to the brightness of gold, for the glory of God is upon it.--Letter 31, 1890, pp. 1-2. (To Brother Samuel Fulton, April 23, 1890.)",
