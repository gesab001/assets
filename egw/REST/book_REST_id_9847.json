    "word": "The Father loves all who are believers in deed and in truth, as members of that body of which Christ is the head. You must now sit down under Christ's shadow, and you will realize His peace. Think of Christ. Look to Him in faith, believing His promises. Keep your mind trustful. He will be your stay. Lean on Him, depend on Him. Do not be sorrowful above measure, but bear up; for a heavy burden rests upon you. Put your trust in One whose arm will never fail you.",
