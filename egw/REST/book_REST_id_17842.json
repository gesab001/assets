These have been favored, while some who possessed more moral worth, and whose influence was more healthful and saving, received but a small sum. Bro. and Sr. C. Smith have foolishly indulged their children, labored to gratify their every desire, and remove from them all cause of discontent. It is right that this should be done to a degree; but Bro. and Sr. Smith have carried their fondness to extremes, to the injury of their children. Bro. Smith was wrong in pleading with Bro. Aldrich to increase the wages of his daughters. They received all their labor was worth. Bro. Aldrich was wrong in being influenced in this direction. It only hurt them. Some, at the same time, were performing more taxing labor, and were struggling with difficulties, who deserved an increase of wages. But these were not thought of. Brn.
