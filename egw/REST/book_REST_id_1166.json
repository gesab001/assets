    "word": "Men of Action--The Lord calls for minutemen, men who will be prepared to speak words in season and out of season that will arrest the attention and convict the heart.  The kingdom of God consisteth not in outward show.  Light will not be received by following selfish plans, but by looking unto Jesus, following Christ's leadings, not the suppositions of men.  The kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.  It often happens that circumstances arise which demand prompt action.  And sometimes precious opportunities \n74\nhave been lost because of delay.  The one who should have acted promptly felt that he must first consult with some one who was far away and who was unacquainted with the true conditions.  Much time has thus been lost in asking advice and counsel from men who were not in a position to give wise counsel.  Let all God's workers be guided by the word of truth which points out their duty, following implicitly the directions Christ has given.--Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 497, 498.",
