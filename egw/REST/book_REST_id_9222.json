    "word": "Commercialism to Be Purged From Every Office.--All heaven is interested in the work in which we are engaged. We must do a solid, not a superficial, work. I am grieved when I see our printing offices doing so much commercial work, virtually saying to the world, \"Bring your work to us; we will do it for you.\" We have more work for the Lord than we can possibly perform. There is much to be done that we will overlook unless we are baptized with the Holy Spirit. We desire that commercialism shall be purged from every office.--MS 73, 1906.",
