    "word": "S. S. Moana, Sept. 1, 1900. We have had pleasant weather until today, which has been dark and cloudy. I have kept closely to my room all day. This is our first Sabbath on board. It does not seem like a peaceful day of rest, for overhead, on the upper deck, there is great noise. Men are amusing themselves by pitching quoits, and the noise is loud and confusing.",
