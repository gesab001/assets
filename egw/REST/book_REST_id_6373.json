    "word": "\"It is rainy today, so that I do not mow, or I should not write. I mow five days for unbelievers, and Sunday for believers, and rest on the seventh day, therefore I have but very little time to write. . . . God gives me strength to labor hard all day. . . . Brother Holt, Brother John Belden, and I have taken one hundred acres of grass to mow, at eighty-seven and one half cents per acre, and board ourselves. Praise the Lord! I hope to get a few dollars here to use in the cause of God.\"",
