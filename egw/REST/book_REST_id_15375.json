    "word": "The Lord Jesus is looking upon every soul with intense interest. He has declared that the spiritual character of His church is to be carefully maintained. The church is in the world, and is to do a work for the world, but the doors of the church are not to be opened to worldliness. \"Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up\" (Matthew 15:13). The church must be strictly guarded. Its sacred character must be demonstrated to the world. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure\" (Philippians 2:12, 13). . . .",
