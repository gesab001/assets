    "word": "Our Lord was a successful worker with the common people. This was the class that always heard Him gladly. Why, oh why, I inquire, are there so few that carry any burden for souls? His heart was yearning to make souls happy. \"Come unto Me,\" He said, \"all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light\" [Matthew 11:28-30].",
