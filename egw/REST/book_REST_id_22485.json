    "word": "The saving of human souls is an interest infinitely above any other line of work in our world. Whoever is brought under the influence of the truth, and through faith is made a partaker of Christ's love is by that very fact appointed of God to save others. He has a mission in the world. He is to be a co-laborer with Christ, making known the truth as it is in Jesus, and when men, in any line of God's work, seek to bring the minds and talent of the Lord's human agents under his control, he has assumed a jurisdiction over their fellow-men that they cannot maintain without injustice and iniquity. The Lord has placed no man as judge either of the pen or the voice of God's workmen.",
