    "word": "August 15. We leave here for Napier. I think we will be comfortable. Brother Mountain is going to help us off in the morning. He worked late. Last night Nina's father came to see us and her. He seems quite an intelligent man. He thinks it the most wonderful thing that I take an interest in their daughter and expressed great gratitude as though we were doing them a great favor. I assured him we would have an interest in her. He thought it was such a rare thing, so unexpected.--Letter 138, 1893. (To W. C. White, August 13, 1893.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C.
