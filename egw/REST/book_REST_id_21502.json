    "word": "Middletown, Conn., September 4, 1904: We had a tentfull Sabbath, and all listened with interest to the words spoken. Our brethren were fearful that Sunday we should have but few out to hear, and I thought they might be disappointed in this matter, but the disappointment was the other way. The large tent was full, and some were on the outside. The Lord gave me strength to hold the congregation. I spoke earnestly from John 3, first part of the chapter. The Lord gave me a message upon temperance and the Lord Jesus, the great Gift in behalf of man. \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
