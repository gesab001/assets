    "word": "Mrs. E. G. White: My most recent burden has been to make known to our brethren that during the tent meeting season, those who are especially adapted \n\n\n                                    -51- \n\nto labor in camp meetings and other large gatherings are not to be held from these meetings by any city work or local affairs in which they may be interested. In our tent meetings we must have speakers who can make a good impression on the people. The ability of one man, however intelligent this man may be, is insufficient to meet the need. A variety of talents should be brought into these meetings.",
