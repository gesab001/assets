    "word": "Upon the older students in the school rests the responsibility of helping those who are younger. The older students can be a great help to their younger associates by setting a good example in pleasant words and actions, and by their influence outside of the school hours, that they may teach lessons of obedience, truthfulness, and respect to their instructors. The Lord looks with pleasure upon such helpful endeavor. When the students are out-of-doors, taking their exercise, or wherever they may be, let the older ones study how to speak encouraging words to the younger ones.",
