    "word": "To us as a people God has given advanced light, and we are to seek to gain access to souls, that we may give them this truth. As the physicians and nurses in our sanitariums hold out to the patients the hope of restoration to physical health, they are also to present the blessed hope of the gospel, the wonderful comfort to be found in the Mighty Healer, who can cure the leprosy of the soul. Thus hearts will be reached, and He who gives health to the body will speak peace to the soul. The Lifegiver will fill the heart with a joy that will work miraculously. Letter 50, 1900, pp. 1, 2. (To Brother Murphet, March 29, 1900.)",
