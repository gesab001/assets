    "word": "Help for the Body through the Mind. \n     988. Great wisdom is needed . . . in order to cure the body through the mind. But few realize the power that the mind has over the body. A great deal of the sickness which afflicts humanity has its origin in the mind, and can only be cured by restoring the mind to health. There are very many more than we imagine who are sick mentally. To deal with men and women whose minds as well as bodies are diseased, is nice work.--T., V. III, p. 184.",
