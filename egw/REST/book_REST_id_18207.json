    "word": "In past years the colored people have been terribly neglected. The time is coming when we cannot easily give them the message. Restrictions will be placed about them to such an extent that it will be next to impossible to reach them; but at the present time this is not the case, and we can go to many places where there are colored people, and can open the Scriptures to their understanding, and lead them to accept the truths of God's Word. Christ will make the impression upon their hearts.",
