    "word": "There is no place for us to rest in a careless attitude. We must never forget the warnings of Christ, \"Watch unto prayer,\" \"Watch . . . and pray always\" (Luke 21:36). A connection with the divine agency every moment is essential to our progress. We may have had a measure of the Spirit of God, but by prayer and faith we are continually to seek more of the Spirit. It will never do to cease our efforts. If we do not progress, if we do not place ourselves in an attitude to receive both the former and the latter rain, we shall lose our souls, and the responsibility will lie at our own door.",
