    "word": "Jesus encourages us to look on the bright side. He tells us to pray with unshaken faith, \"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\" For these words shall surely be fulfilled. Work to the limit of your ability to answer this prayer. You will then feel so weighty a responsibility resting on you that you will put away from you all selfishness, all slothfulness, all indifference. You will rid yourself of all that Satan \n\n\n                                     -129- \n\ncould take advantage of in his efforts to defeat Christ's prayer.",
