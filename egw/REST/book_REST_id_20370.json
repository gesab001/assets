    "word": "Many have the idea that they are responsible to Christ alone for their light and their experience independent of Christ's acknowledged body in the world.

He asks Christ, \"What wilt Thou have me to do?\" The Saviour does not tell him directly but places him in His direction in connection with His church--They will tell thee what thou must do.",
