    "word": "The United States is the power represented by the beast with lamblike horns, and . . . this prophecy will be fulfilled when the United States shall enforce Sunday observance, which Rome claims as the special acknowledgment of her supremacy. But in this homage to Papacy the United States will not be alone. The influence of Rome in the countries that once acknowledged her dominion, is still far from being destroyed. And prophecy foretells a restoration of her power. \"I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.\" Revelation 13:3.",
