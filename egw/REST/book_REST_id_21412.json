    "word": "My dear brother, you are in ill health. You have not peace and rest in the Lord. Your spiritual experience is not healthy. You do not do the good you might if you would place yourself as a learner in the school of Christ. The Lord cannot prosper you while you continue to seek for authority. Your passionate outbursts against your brethren hurt your influence and grieve your Redeemer. Thus you misrepresent Him.",
