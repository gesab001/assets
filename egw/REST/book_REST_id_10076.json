    "word": "THIS SKETCH OF THE WORK AND THE WORKERS DOES NOT CLAIM TO BE COMPLETE. IT WAS NEVER CONSIDERED BY ME OR BY ANY OF SISTER WHITE'S HELPERS THAT THE PERSONNEL OF HER WORKING FORCE WAS OF ANY PRIMARY INTEREST TO THE READERS OF HER BOOKS. SHE WROTE THE MATTER. SHE WROTE VERY FULLY. THERE WAS ALWAYS A CONTROVERSY BETWEEN HER AND THE PUBLISHERS REGARDING THE QUANTITY OF MATTER THAT SHOULD BE USED. SISTER WHITE WAS BEST PLEASED WHEN A SUBJECT WAS PRESENTED VERY FULLY, AND THE PUBLISHERS WERE ALWAYS BRINGING PRESSURE TO BEAR TO HAVE THE MATTER CONDENSED OR ABBREVIATED SO THAT THE BOOK WOULD NOT BE TOO LARGE. CONSEQUENTLY, AFTER IMPORTANT CHAPTERS WERE PREPARED FOR THE PRINTER, AND SOMETIMES AFTER THEY WERE SENT TO THE PRINTER, A NEW PRESENTATION OF THE SUBJECT WOULD BE GIVEN SISTER WHITE, AND SHE WOULD WRITE ADDITIONAL MATTER AND INSIST UPON ITS BEING INCORPORATED. THIS EXPERIENCE APPLIED CHIEFLY TO THE GREAT CONTROVERSY, VOL. IV.",
