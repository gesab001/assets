Each must act its individual part, but both must blend together; then the interests of both will be advanced. If there is co-operation \n                                                                           223\nbetween the educational work and the work of the sanitarium, we can heartily recommend that the higher education be carried on in the sanitarium grounds; for this is the Lord's plan. If the men at the head of this enterprise plan for the usefulness of these institutions, each helping the other, there is nothing to hinder the operations of the school. As the work grows, buildings may have to be prepared. \n\n\n                              Ellen G. White \n\n                                               -",
