    "word": "Need for Getting Away From Work: \n     I see many subjects to write out which must be done with the greatest care. I want this summer, the whole of it, to do this work in. I must stop a day or two in the week and go somewhere or my head will break down. I begrudge every moment that I feel compelled to rest. These intensely interesting subjects weary me far more to write them out than to speak upon them.--Letter 9, 1876, p. 2. (To James White, April 18, 1876.)",
