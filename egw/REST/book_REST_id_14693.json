    "word": "My brethren, in His great mercy and love God has given you great light, and Christ says to you, \"Freely ye have received, freely give.\" Let the light bestowed on you shine forth to those in darkness. Let us rejoice and be glad that Christ has not only given us His word, but has given us also the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of God, and that in His strength we may be more than conquerors. Christ is saying: \"Come unto Me. To Me belong right counsel and sound judgment. I have understanding and strength for you.\" By faith we must rest in Christ, remembering the words of one who was inspired of God to write, \"Thy gentleness hath made me great.\" Ask God to give you much of the oil of His grace. Carefully consider every word, whether it be written or spoken.--Review and Herald, December 22, 1904.",
