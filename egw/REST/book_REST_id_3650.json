    "word": "Sermons With Fresh Ideas.--Never weary the hearers by long discourses. This is not wise. For many years I have been laboring on this point, seeking to have our brethren sermonize less, and devote their time and strength to making important points of truth plain, for every point will be assailed by our opponents. Everyone connected with the work should keep fresh ideas; . . . and by tact and foresight bring all that is possible into your work to interest your hearers.--Letter 48, 1886.",
