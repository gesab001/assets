    "word": "A teacher who has an intelligent knowledge of the best methods and who can not only teach the theory, but can show by example how things should be done, will never be a drug on the market. Young men should not always be as servants, who must be told what to do, and who when one job is done have no perception to look around and see what more needs to be done. They should look the situation squarely in the face, saying this will not do. Unless I learn how to work, how to manage difficult problems, how to wrestle with difficult problems, I will be of no practical value. I must and will rise. I will mount from the lowest to the highest round of the ladder. He who manifests this determination will make a trustworthy worker; for his aim is to advance in knowledge and increase in understanding. He can be depended on as a thoughtful caretaker.",
