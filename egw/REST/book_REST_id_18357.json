    "word": "The work in Washington should be made second to no other work. I am strongly impressed that we should put to active use, in this city, the very best talent we can obtain. A good work has been begun by the meetings that have been held there. And at this point, to call away Brethren Daniells, Prescott, Washburn and others, and to distribute this talent among the various states, leaving men of less ability to carry on the important work in Washington would seem to me to be poor economy. I cannot see the interest that has been awakened in that city left unprovided for, without entering my protest. Furnish strong men for Washington, where a strong work is to be done. Letter 55, 1904, pp. 1,2. (to W. C. White, January 29, 1904.)",
