    "word": "From this history we can see that there are circumstances under which it is proper for a woman to act promptly and independently, moving with decision in the way she knows to be the way of the Lord. The wife is to stand by the side of the husband as his equal, sharing all the responsibilities of life, rendering due respect to him who has selected her for his life-long companion. \u201cFor the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he [referring to Christ] is the saviour of the body,\u201d or church. . . . When the Spirit of Christ controls the husband, the wife\u2019s subjection will result only in rest and benefit, for he will require from her only that which will result in good, and in the same way that Christ requires submission from the church. . . .",
