    "word": "If God were to call any of us to leave positions where it is for our interest to retain them and we go according to the light God gives us, why, the Lord knows all about that. Although Abraham was promised that he should have the whole of Canaan, God said, \"Walk through the land in the length of it and the breadth of it,\" yet he had not a foot of it in his possession. If we do not realize any very wonderful prosperity in this life, yet we have the claim of the future, immortal life. It is stated of Abraham that he looked for a city whose builder and maker was God. When he buried Sarah, he did not have so much as a piece of land in which to put his dead. He had to buy it. But when the Lord opened before him the view of immortal life, of this earth purified, which was to be his home, he was satisfied. So with every one of us. We are only pilgrims and strangers in this world. We are seeking the city which Abraham looked \n\n\n                                 -121- \n\nfor, whose builder and maker is God. We do not expect all the reward here in possessions, in land, in gold, or in silver, but we expect an eternal weight of glory.--Manuscript 19, 1886, pp. 1,5-7.
