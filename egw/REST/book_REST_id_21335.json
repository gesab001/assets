    "word": "Such a state of things will bring a terrible reaction. The dearth of money and facilities that has been felt in the Southern field is a severe witness against the men who have proved themselves untrustworthy. The money raised for the work in the South was not donated to the General Conference, neither was it donated to the Pacific Press Publishing House. It was no more the property of the General Conference or the Pacific Press than it was my property. The diverting of this means from its proper channel was a fraudulent transaction, which stands recorded against the actors. Every dollar of this money--the principal and the interest up to the present time--should be placed where God designed it should be. I accuse no one; but God knows every action.",
