I believe the work is of God, and is given to comfort and strengthen His 'scattered, torn, and peeled people,' since the closing up of our work for the world in October, 1844.\" [FROM A BROADSIDE, ENTITLED, \"A VISION,\" PUBLISHED IN APRIL, 1847 (PRESS OF BENJAMIN LINDSEY, NEW BEDFORD), AND REPRINTED BY ELDER JAMES WHITE IN \"A WORD TO THE LITTLE FLOCK,\" PAGE 21, MAY, 1847.]",
