    "word": "After the meeting closed, a tall, well-dressed lady hastened to the stand, grasped my hand, and said, \"I am so glad to see you. I wish to thank you for writing the book, The Great Controversy. It was the means of saving the soul of my son. He was sick, and we knew he could not live. He asked me to give him a book that would be a help to him religiously. I had purchased The Great Controversy, but had not read it myself, and I brought him the book. My son read it through with the deepest interest, and said, 'I have found in this book what I have not found in any other book in your library. Every time I read it, I see the truth in a more beautiful light. Every time I open it, I find something that helps me. I am not afraid to die now; for I have found rest and peace in Jesus Christ.'\"",
