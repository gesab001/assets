    "word": "MR No. 1449 - Intelligent Labor\n\n     (Written to D.T. Bourdeau, a \"Much-respected Fellow Laborer.\") \n\n     I have been shown that God has a work for you to do, and you can do it to His acceptance if you rely firmly upon the arm that is infinite. But you must not think that He would have you bear the whole burden of His work. The cause is the Lord's; He will take care of His own. You could do much greater and more efficient work if you would cultivate calm trust in God, and not become anxious and worried, as though Jesus still lay in the sepulcher, and you had no Saviour. He has risen; He has ascended to the heavens, and is your advocate before the throne of God. You may prefer your requests to God, knowing that you have a faithful High Priest, who will be touched with the feeling of your infirmities; for He has been tempted in all points like as we are. Do not feel that God is unmindful of you, but always remember that He loves you, and is willing to give you rest and peace in Him.",
