    "word": "It is not a time when marriage should be regarded in the light of felicity. It is uncertain business. More misery than happiness is the result; and yet marrying and giving in marriage is as it was in the days of Noah. There seems to be no restraint; but passion and impulse have controlling power, and youth seem to be bewitched with love-sick sentimentalism. For this reason rules and regulations are highly essential to guard those connected with the Sanitarium, the college, and the office of publication; and anyone who regards these restrictions as unnecessary has not spiritual discernment, and will prove a hindrance rather than a help.",
