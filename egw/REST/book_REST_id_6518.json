    "word": "\"This was the first camp meeting that Melbourne had seen, and it was a marvel of wonders to the people. Far and near the sound went out concerning this city of tents, and a most wonderful interest was awakened. Every afternoon and evening the tent was filled to its utmost capacity, not with a cheap order of society, but \n                                                                           347\nwith people of intelligence, physicians of note, ministers, and business men. We saw that with the blessing of God this camp meeting would do more to bring our work before the people than years of labor could possibly do.",
