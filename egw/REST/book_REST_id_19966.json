    "word": "Jesus' voice of invitation is heard, Come unto Me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest; take My yoke (not a yoke that you have manufactured) and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. [See Matthew 11:28, 29.] Take all your temporal concerns to Jesus. Prayer in regard to temporal things is an expression of confidence and trust in God. As a child has confidence and trust in its earthly parents, you acknowledge God as your Father; as His child you tell Him your needs--and how sweet to the Christian is this trusting faith. You can say, I have laid down all my burdens at the feet of Jesus. I have committed myself without reserve into His care. He has me in charge; I am not my own; I am bought with a price. He is infallible in wisdom, omnipotent in power, and infinite in knowledge. He must and will give me His wisdom. May the Lord help and strengthen you. \n\n\n                                    -107-",
