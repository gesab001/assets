    "word": "PH101 - Testimony Relative to Marriage Duties, and Extremes in The Health Reform (1869)\n\n\n     The following testimony was written for the especial benefit of the church at Monroe, Wisconsin. When written out, the case seemed of that nature and importance to demand more than a written copy. I therefore decided to have one hundred copies printed for the friends more especially interested in the matter. But as this testimony treats upon matters of interest to all health reformers, especially to those affected by the influence of extremists, I have thought best to print an edition sufficient to supply all who may wish to read it.",
