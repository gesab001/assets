    "word": "Those whose testimony awaken the apprehension of the soul, offend pride, and arouse opposition. The hatred of evil against good exists as surely now as in the days of Christ, when the multitude cried, \"Away with Him!\" \"Release unto us Barabbas.\" There is no kind of evil in our world, but that some have an interest in maintaining it. Evil is ever warring against good. And since we know that the conflict with the prince of darkness is constant, and must be severe, let us be united in the warfare. Cease to war against those of your own faith. Let no one help Satan in his work. . . .",
