    "word": "The enemy has encouraged feelings of hatred in the hearts of many. The errors committed by Bro. Bell have been reported from one person to another, constantly growing in magnitude, as busy, gossiping tongues added fuel to the fire.

Some of these children are a disgrace to the church, and a disgrace to the name of Adventists.",
