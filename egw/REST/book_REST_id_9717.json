In our schools the work of redemption is not carefully studied. Many of the students have no real conception of what the plan of salvation means. God's word is pledged in our behalf. He who is touched with the feeling of our infirmities invites us: \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30).",
