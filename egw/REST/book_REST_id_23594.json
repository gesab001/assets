    "word": "Sometimes, after these workers have borne the burden and the heat of the day, and by patient, persevering effort have established a school or a sanitarium, or some other interest for the advancement of the work, the decision is made by their brethren that some other man might do better, and therefore that he is to take charge of the work they have been doing. In some cases, the decision is made without giving due consideration and credit to those who have born the disagreeable part of the work, who have labored, and prayed, and striven, putting into their labor all their strength and energy, and have not failed nor become discouraged.",
