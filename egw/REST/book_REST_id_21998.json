The time had arrived for our California camp-meeting which was to be held in Oakland, but there seemed little probability that I should be able to attend the meeting. While the workers meeting was in session, it was a question with me and my friends who attended me, whether I should ever rise from my severe attack of sickness. I felt no desire to recover. I had no power even to pray, and no desire to live. Rest, only rest, was my desire, quiet and rest. As I lay for two weeks in nervous prostration, I had hope that no one would beseech the throne of grace in my behalf. When the crises came, it was the impression that I would die, and this was my thought. But it was not the will of my heavenly Father. My work was not yet done. Word came from Oakland that a special season of prayer was held in my behalf in order to plead that the Lord would raise me up and give me strength to attend the meeting. I had been confined to my bed for two weeks. The members of the household could not see any decided improvement, and they said there was no hope of my recovery unless the Lord would work in my behalf. But they decided that if I would consent to go to Oakland from my sick bed, the Lord would renew my strength. In answer to their solicitations, I was taken to the cars Sept. 21, and a bed was made upon the seats, and I was strengthened to endure the journey. To walk out by faith against all appearances, was the very thing that the Lord required me to do. \n                                                                           48",
