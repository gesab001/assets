    "word": "Bro. Waggoner had heard the testimony that Brn. Andrews, White, Waggoner, and Smith, should stand together in the great work before them, and all labor to one end, to advance the interests of the cause of God. Bro. Waggoner followed his own spirit, and overlooked the testimonies of warning which had been given to him. He should have known, by the repeated testimonies that the Lord has given him, that his judgment has been greatly perverted by home influence. His course has not been free from blame, even in his family. \n                                                                           94\nThe spirit he met at his home, he carried with him in dealing with his brethren abroad, He has frequently been severe and overbearing, and made matters more complicated than if he had never touched them. From the testimonies of warning the Lord has given Bro. Waggoner, he should have known that Battle Creek was not the place for him to labor.",
