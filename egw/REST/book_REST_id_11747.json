    "word": "Some parents mistake in giving their children too much liberty. They sometimes have so much confidence in them that they do not see their faults. It is wrong to allow children, at some expense, to visit at a distance, unaccompanied by their parents or guardians. It has a wrong influence upon the children. They feel that they are of considerable consequence, and that certain privileges belong to them, and if not granted them, they think themselves abused. They refer to children who go and come, and have many privileges, while they have so few. And the mother fears that the children will think her unjust unless she gratifies their wishes, which in the end proves a great injury to the children. Impressions are often received by the young visitors, who have not a parent's watchful eye over them to see and correct their faults, which will take months to do away. I was referred to cases where parents have had good, obedient children, and have had the utmost confidence in certain families, and trusted their children to go from them at a distance to visit them, which has caused an entire change from that time in the deportment and character of their children. Formerly they were contended and happy at home, and had no great desire to be much in the company of other young people. When they return to their parents, restraint seems unjust, and home is like a prison to them. Such unwise movements of parents decide the character of their children.",
