    "word": "73\nEARNEST, FERVENT PRAYER IS NEEDED, NOT FEEBLE, HEARTLESS PRAYERS.\u2014There is need of prayer,\u2014most earnest, fervent, agonizing prayer,\u2014such prayer as David offered when he exclaimed: \u201cAs the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.\u201d\u201cI have longed after Thy precepts;\u201d\u201cI have longed for Thy salvation.\u201d\u201cMy soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.\u201d\u201cMy soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto Thy judgments.\u201d This is the spirit of wrestling prayer, such as was possessed by the royal psalmist.",
