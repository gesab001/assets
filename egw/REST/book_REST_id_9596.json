    "word": "No Exercise Can Take the Place of Walking \n\n     Those who are feeble and indolent should not yield to their inclination to be inactive, thus depriving themselves of air and sunlight, but should practice exercising out of doors in walking or working in the garden. They will become very much fatigued, but this will not injure them.  You, my sister, will experience weariness, yet it will not hurt you; your rest will be sweeter after it.  Inaction weakens the organs that are not exercised. And when these organs are used, pain and weariness are experienced, because the muscles have become feeble.  It is not good policy to give up the use of certain muscles because pain is felt when they are exercised. The pain is frequently caused by the effort of nature to give life and vigor to those parts that have become partially lifeless through inaction.  The motion of these long-disused muscles will cause pain, because nature is awakening them to life.",
