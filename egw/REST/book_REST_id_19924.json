    "word": "But I entreat of you to drop your burdens upon the Burden bearer. You will not then be drifting away from God, for by faith you are anchored upon His promise. You cannot doubt the love of your dear Saviour for you, my son, even for you. You cannot distrust His mercy. Only believe He has spared you to work for Him. Seek for a deep and living experience in the things of God and learn of Him who is meek and lowly of heart and you will find rest to your soul.--Letter 2b, 1874, pp. 1-3. (To her son, W. C. White, 19 years of age.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 11, 1982",
