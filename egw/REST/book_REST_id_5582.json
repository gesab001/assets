On my frequent journeys across the continent, I do not patronize restaurants, dining-cars, or hotels, for the simple reason that I cannot eat the food there provided. The dishes are highly seasoned with salt and pepper, creating an almost intolerable thirst. . . . They irritate and inflame the delicate coating of the stomach. . . .

Food should be prepared in as simple a manner as possible, free from condiments and spices, and even from an undue amount of salt.-- R. and H., 1883, No. 44.",
