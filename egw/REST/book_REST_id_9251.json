    "word": "Short, Spiritual Articles.--I wish to ask you [Elder S. N. \n\n226 \n\nHaskell] to be sure and keep your articles in the Watchman constantly. Elder R's articles are long, and unless he changes, he will kill the circulation of the Watchman. There should be short, spiritual articles in the Watchman. ... I cannot give my consent to have one man's signature to so many long articles. . . . There is need of deeper spirituality in the articles published in the Watchman if the interest in the paper is to be kept up.--Lt 78, 1906.",
