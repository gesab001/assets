    "word": "The curtain has been lifted. I have seen the rich reward laid up for the saints. I have had a taste of the joys of the world to come, and it has spoiled this world for me. My affections, my interests, hopes, my all is in heaven. I long to see the King in His beauty, Him whom my soul loveth. Heaven, sweet heaven. \"I long to be there; and the thought that 'tis near, makes me almost impatient for Christ to appear.\" Praise the Lord for a good hope through Jesus Christ of immortality and eternal life.--Letter 9, 1851.",
