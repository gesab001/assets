    "word": "The question is, What does God say? What does He require? If he has a heart to be obedient to that which he knows to be truth, then his works will be acceptable to God. If he is not conscientious, but would wait to see if he can find a convenient position where it will be no cross to obey the truth, then his obedience is not acceptable to God. He will have a religion of convenience--serve God when it is for his interest to do so, and let it alone and be disobedient when the truth stands in his way of ease or prosperity.",
