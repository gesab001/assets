    "word": "Of all the destructive errors which are entering religious bodies, none is so fatal a deception, none so sure to separate man from God, as the one with which you have ventured to experiment. You are not in the right way. I present to you the guide for Christian service--the pure, unadulterated Word of God. This is a treasure house of knowledge. Practical religion rests upon the principles found in this Word. Vague ideas and suppositions have no part nor lot in the matter. In the Word of God there is definiteness, clearness, and beautiful symmetry. Its proportions are harmonious.",
