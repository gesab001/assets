R. \n\n\n                               Diary \n\n\n                            January 1898 \n\n\n             Medical Missionary Work and the Ministry \n\n\n     The question has been asked, did you not give Dr. Kellogg encouragement after he had entered into this work? I answer, I did; for I had been instructed that a work of this character should be done by all our churches; that a deep interest should be taken in this very line of work; that according to the light which the Lord had been pleased to give me, this line of work should have been taken hold of with resolution by our ministers, not to create a large center in one place, but to establish the work in many cities and to arouse the people to give of the Lord's money for the work in behalf of suffering humanity.",
