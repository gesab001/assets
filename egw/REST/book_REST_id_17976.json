    "word": "In the dining-room and kitchen I saw marks of negligence and untidiness. The floors were not cleanly, and there was a great lack of thoroughness, of nicety and order. These things speak to all who have access to these rooms, of the character of the workers. The impression would not be made that the Sanitarium had a class of neat, faithful, orderly helpers. Some have labored faithfully, while others have done their work mechanically, as though they had no interest in it except to get through as quickly as possible. \n                                                                           91\nOrder and thoroughness were neglected, because no one was near to watch them and criticise their work. Unfaithfulness was written against their names.",
