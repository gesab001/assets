    "word": "MR No. 757 - Under the Control of the Enemy\n\n     He who is under the control of the enemy of all good exerts an influence wholly for evil. He has strong passions, which should be controlled, but he feels under no holy restraint, and his manifestations of envy and jealousy, his outbursts of anger, and his evil surmisings make him a demon in his home. He will not do the will of God. He needs to be taken in hand, and like a rebellious child disciplined and chastened, for he is ruining himself. His course is downward.-- Manuscript 1, 1899, p. 8. (\"Unity, Courtesy, Love,\" January 1, 1899.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. January 2, 1980",
