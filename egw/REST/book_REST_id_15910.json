    "word": "Let us respond to Christ's invitation, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). To respond to this invitation, we must let go all self-importance, all feeling of superiority, and bow in submission to the will of God.",
