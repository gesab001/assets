    "word": "The followers of Christ are to be separate from the world in principles and interests, but they are not to isolate themselves from the world. The Saviour mingled constantly with men, not to encourage them in anything that was not in accordance with God's will, but to uplift and ennoble them. \"I sanctify Myself,\" He declared, \"that they also might be sanctified.\" John 17:19. So the Christian is to abide among men, that the savor of divine love may be as salt to preserve the world from corruption.",
