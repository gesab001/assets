    "word": "Let us cherish the truth which has been spoken to us and the counsel that has been given to us by men through whom God has manifested His will in a marked manner. Let us be grateful that there were men who appropriated the grace of Christ, and bore the burden in the heat of the day, whose lips are now silent. The Lord Jesus bade John to write of them, \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.\" We should be careful how we handle the names of the precious and blessed ones who sleep in Jesus.",
