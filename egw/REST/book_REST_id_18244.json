    "word": "My life has been spared by the mercy of God to do a certain work. I have pledged that life to Him, but the work is not always easy to perform. I have to take positions not in harmony with men whom I believe to be God's workmen, and I see that I must do this in the future as in the past. It hurts me more than I can tell. The dearest hope that I can have may not be realized, yet if God will show me the right way, I will walk in it. Letter 64, 1894, pp. 4, 5. (To Elder O. A. Olsen, May 6, 1894.)",
