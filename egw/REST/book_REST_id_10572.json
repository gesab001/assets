    "word": "Every man's experience testifies to the truth of the words of Scripture, \"The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest. . . . There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked,\" Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued, we can find no rest. The masterful passions of the heart no human power can control. We are as helpless here as were the disciples to quiet the raging storm. But He who spoke peace to the billows of Galilee, has spoken the word of peace for every soul. However fierce the tempest, those who turn to Jesus . . . will find deliverance. His grace . . . quiets the strife of human passion, and in His love the heart is at rest. \n                                                                           105",
