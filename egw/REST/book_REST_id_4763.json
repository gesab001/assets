    "word": "Few realize the significance of the words of Luke, that when Paul saw his brethren, \"he thanked God, and took courage.\" [Acts 28:15.] In the midst of the weeping, sympathizing company of believers, who were not ashamed of his bonds, the apostle praised God aloud. The cloud of sadness that had rested upon his spirit was swept away. His Christian life had been a succession of trials, sufferings, and disappointments, but in that hour he felt abundantly repaid. With firmer step and joyful heart he continued on his way. He would not complain of the past, nor fear for the future. Bonds and afflictions awaited him, he knew; but he knew also that it had been his to deliver souls from a bondage infinitely more terrible, and he rejoiced in his sufferings for Christ's sake.--\"The Acts of the Apostles,\" page 449. \n\n\n                                               [269]",
