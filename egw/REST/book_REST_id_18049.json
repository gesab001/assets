    "word": "Bro. Waggoner is naturally independent and self-sufficient. He estimates his ability to do more highly than it will bear. Bro. Waggoner, you pray for the Lord to humble you, and fit you for his work, and when the Lord answers your prayer, and puts you under a course of discipline necessary for the accomplishment of the object, you frequently give way to doubts and despondency, and think you have reasons for discouragements. \n                                                                           137\nYou frequently think Bro. White is restraining you, when he has cautioned and held you back from engaging in church difficulties.",
