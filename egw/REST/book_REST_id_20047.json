They have so many calls that the three married couples separate, one going to one place and the other to another, to hold readings with those who are interested. New families, one after another, are soliciting help, \n\n\n                                    -355- \n\nand the workers say that ten or twenty more could be employed to good advantage. In the mission there is a company of twelve. Two classes are held everyday, that the workers may receive instruction from the Bible, and know how to work to enlighten others. Many calls have been made by sick people, and the young ladies at the mission, who are receiving their education, are visiting the sick and doing what they can to relieve their sufferings. This opens the way to gain access to still others.",
