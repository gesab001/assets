    "word": "Be Courteous. \n\n     As a people we should cultivate a kindly manner in our association with those whom we meet. Let us avoid any abruptness of manner, and endeavor always to present the truth in an easy, winning manner. This truth means life, eternal life, to the receiver. Pass easily and courteously from subjects of a temporal nature to the spiritual and eternal. In this courteous manner the Saviour taught. And we should work in the most gentle way to introduce our mission. While walking by the way, or seated to rest by the wayside, we may be able to drop into some heart the seeds of truth. \n                                                                           4",
