    "word": "One day we rode out to a place of resort at the sea-shore, about ten miles from the city. As we look across the strait, here about sixteen miles wide, the hills of Sweden are visible in the distance. The water is very clear, so that the white, sandy bottom can be distinctly seen for a considerable distance. It is strewn with rocks, and with mounds of sea moss of lighter and darker shades of green, forming a lovely picture. At a little distance from the beach is an extensive park four miles in length, a dense forest of beech-trees interspersed with evergreens. This forest is kept like a garden, and there are walks and drives extending through it in all directions.",
