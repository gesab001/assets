    "word": "In order to render to God perfect service you need to accept the invitation, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" You have not always pursued the course that will ensure to you the blessing of God. Do you want the abiding presence of Christ in your family? Then you must obey the Word, \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me.\" As you take upon you Christ's yoke of restraint and obedience, you will by individual experience find rest. Lift Christ's yoke, not a yoke of your own manufacture, which will always be galling. \"Ye shall find rest unto your soul,\" He declares. \"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" In Christ's school learn perfectly the lessons of meekness and lowliness of heart. Seek to do His will and to glorify His name. . . .",
