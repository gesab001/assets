    "word": "Speculation by Ministers \n\n     We are nearing the close of time. We want not only to teach present truth in the pulpit, but to live it out of the pulpit. Examine closely the foundation of your hope of salvation. While you stand in the position of a herald of truth, a watchman upon the walls of Zion, you cannot have your interest interwoven with mining or real-estate business, and at the same time do effectually the sacred work committed to your hands. \n                                                                           239\nWhere the souls of men are at stake, where eternal things are involved, the interest cannot safely be divided.",
