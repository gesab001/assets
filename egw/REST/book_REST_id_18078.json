    "word": "It will be a difficult work to overcome prejudice and convince the unbelieving that our efforts are disinterested to help them. But this should not hinder our labor. There is no precept in the Word of God that tells us to do good to those only who appreciate and respond to our efforts, and to benefit those only who will thank us for it. God has sent us to work in his vineyard. It is our business to do all we can. \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; thou knowest not which shall prosper, this or that.\" We have too little faith. We limit the Holy One of Israel. We should any of us be grateful that God condescends to use us as his instruments. For every earnest prayer put up in faith for anything, answers will be returned. They may not come just as we have expected; but they \n                                                                           214\nwill come--not perhaps as we have devised, but at the very time when we most need them. But oh! how sinful is our unbelief! \"If ye abide in Me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\"",
