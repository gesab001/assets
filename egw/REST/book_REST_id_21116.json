    "word": "Lucinda, I forgot to tell you when at home not to sew. You can't do the housework and run the machine without overdoing, and just let the things go. They will none of them suffer till I get home. Don't try to do too much, I beg of you. Take good care of the children. Help them all you can to watch. Encourage them and lead them along. I think more of this than all the work you can do. Just let Sister Hewett have the boys' pants, if they really need them, to take home and make. Don't tax your strength too much, but care above all things for the eternal interest of my boys.",
