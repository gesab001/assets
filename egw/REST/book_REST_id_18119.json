    "word": "The interest and zeal that my husband has in the work and cause of God, his earnest desire for the prosperity and advancement of the work of God, inspired him with jealousy for the cause of God.

Waggoner, and presented before him his dangers, and begged of him to refrain from directing so much labor among the churches, and entering into church trials, as he was not the best adapted to help them.",
