    "word": "In the wonderful conversion of Paul we see the miraculous power of God. . . . Jesus, whose name of all others he most hated and despised, revealed Himself to Paul for the purpose of arresting his mad yet honest career, that He might make this most unpromising instrument a chosen vessel to bear the gospel to the Gentiles. . . . The light of heavenly illumination had taken away Paul\u2019s eyesight; but Jesus, the Great Healer of the blind, does not restore it. He answers the question of Paul in these words: \u201cArise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.\u201d Jesus could not only have healed Paul of his blindness, but He could have forgiven his sins and told him his duty by marking out his future course. From Christ all power and mercies were to flow; but He did not give Paul an experience, in his conversion to truth, independent of His church recently organized upon the earth.",
