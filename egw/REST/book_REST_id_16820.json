He seeks to develop the highest efficiency possible on the part of all. If he were to depend upon his officers alone, he could never expect to conduct \n\n\n                 -6- \n\na successful campaign. He counts on loyal, untiring service from every man in his army. The responsibility rests largely upon the men in the ranks.",
