    "word": "Relative to Leading Ministers. \n\n\n     The Lord would have Brn. Andrews, Waggoner, Smith, and White, stand united in the work of God. These have had experience in the work, and they should all share the burdens of responsibility in the cause. They may each have a particular work, for which they are best adapted, and which they love; but their attachment to one particular branch should not be indulged in, and lead them to leave the heaviest and most perplexing burdens upon my husband. If each one would take a share, and educate himself to have a general interest, as is proper, the burdens need not crush out the life of any one.",
