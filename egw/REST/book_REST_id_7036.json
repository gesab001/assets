    "word": "The first class had Christ interwoven into their character, and they were not conscious of anything they had done. \"Come, ye blessed of My Father,\" is the benediction, \"inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" So we see Christ identifies His interests with fallen man. He turns to those on the left hand and says, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in: naked, and ye clothed Me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited Me not.\" And then they ask Him, \"When saw we Thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee?\" And the answer comes, \"Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me.\" Not the greatest but the least.",
