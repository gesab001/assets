    "word": "The Lord is good and greatly to be praised. He has bestowed on you the talent of communicating the truth to others. I have a longing desire that you and every member of your family shall receive the reward to be given to the tried and faithful; that you shall be saved with an everlasting salvation. I have a far greater desire that this shall be, than you suppose. In our daily worship, your family is often mentioned by name. My earnest prayer to God is that you and your wife and children shall be kept by His power. I shall continue to pray for you, my brother and sister, and for your dear children, in whom I am deeply interested. I desire that every one of them shall have the precious experience that they may gain by cooperating with God. Let our prayers ascend to God, Brother and Sister Franke, for the salvation of your \n\n\n                                    -378- \n\nchildren. They are all dear to His heart. He is waiting to be gracious to them. He will receive them. If they will come to Him and learn of Him, he will use them in saving other youth. He will honor them with a sacred trust, making them laborers together with Him. How blest, how doubly blest, is the home in which father, mother, and children are consecrated to the service of Christ.--Letter 126, 1902, pp. 4, 5. (To Brother and Sister Franke, August 7, 1902.)",
