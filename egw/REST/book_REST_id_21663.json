    "word": "Christ has manifested His interest in humanity. He says, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\" We are dealing with Jesus in the person of His saints. Then be very careful how you wound the hearts of your brethren and sisters. We are almost home, pilgrims and strangers only a little longer. All heaven is interested in the salvation of men, and, in harmony with them, we should be interested for those around us. We should be getting ready for the heavenly city.",
