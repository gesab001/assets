    "word": "I was shown that the truth must enter the heart of every physician among us, that it may have a sanctifying influence upon his life; but as a general thing our physicians know not what heart religion means.

The heart is desolate and dreary, though the Spirit of God through His Word invites men to rest in the hope of the glory of God.",
