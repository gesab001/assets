    "word": "Brother Burrill also stated that Elder W. W. Simpson is a Canadian, and that such men as he are needed in Canada. He seems to think that it is not right that Elder Simpson should be held in Los Angeles. I know nothing in regard to Elder Simpson's case, except that he has been used by the Lord in \n\n\n                                -314- \n\nhis work in Los Angeles, and that he has been greatly blessed. Over one hundred have taken their stand for the truth as a result of his labors. At the close of his last series of tent meetings he thought of changing his field of labor, but he received a petition signed by many of the citizens of Los Angeles asking him to remain and continue his meetings. The Lord has given Brother Simpson a spirit of adaptability, with wisdom to plan and carry out his work, and He has blessed him in the bringing out of leaflets, notices, and charts that have aroused the interest of the people.",
