    "word": "There is danger that ministers who profess to believe present truth will rest satisfied with presenting the theory only, while their own souls do not feel its sanctifying power. Some have not the love of God in the heart, softening, molding, and ennobling the life. The psalmist declares of the good man, \u201cHis delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.\u201d Referring to his own experience, he exclaims, \u201cO how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.\u201d \u201cMine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.\u201d [Psalm 1:2; 119:97, 148.]",
