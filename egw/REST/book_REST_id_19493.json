    "word": "My brother, you must have periods of rest, in which you spend some time in the country. I have been instructed that during the summer, you should leave the heat of the city for a cooler atmosphere. Your strained nerves will respond to the grateful restfulness of nature's beautiful scenes. Your lassitude will leave you. You will be strengthened and invigorated, prepared for a fresh effort.--Letter 79, 1902, p. 2. (To E. E. Franke, May 23, 1902.)",
