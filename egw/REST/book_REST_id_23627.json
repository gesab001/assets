    "word": "Those who receive Christ as a personal Saviour, doing His work, and following His way, become members of the royal family. But there are many who, with the clearest evidence before them, are walking directly contrary to His instruction, following in the way of sinners. They do the very same work of accusation that open sinners are doing. In the place of being laborers together with God, washing their robes of character and making them white in the blood of the Lamb, that they may be representatives of the Saviour, setting in word and deed a Christlike example, they employ their faculties and powers in a way that the followers of Satan employ their faculties and powers. They think and speak evil. They spend time and money gathering together jot and titles of evil, and the mouth that ought to be employed in offering thanksgiving to God, is employed in reporting this evil. Many are engaged in Satan's work -- worrying, finding fault, and accusing those who are trying to do the very work that they themselves ought to be doing. The talent of speech is used to destroy the confidence of believers in their brethren. And many Seventh-day Adventists stand before the world as fractious and fault-finding, instead of bound together by oneness with Christ.",
