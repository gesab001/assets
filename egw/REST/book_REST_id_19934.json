    "word": "God has given His only begotten Son, \"that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). Thank God for this. Christ has invited us, \"Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). O what a promise, that! \"I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; . . . and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). Let these words fill us with comfort and hope and peace. While you are worrying over the sins of others Jesus says, turn your eyes away from these things and behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. There is a balm in Gilead; there is a Physician there. Jesus is the great physician, and He can cure all the maladies of the soul. \n\n\n                                      -9-",
