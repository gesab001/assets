    "word": "We want to see the family altar established, and we want there to bring our children right before God with earnest prayer, just as the minister labors for his congregation when he is before them. Every father should feel that he is placed at the head of his household to offer up a sacrifice of thanksgiving to God and of praise to Him, and to present these children to God and seek His blessing to rest upon them, and never rest until he knows that they are accepted of God--until he knows that they are children of the Most High. Here is a work for the mother. What a responsibility rests upon her! Do we consider and realize that the greatest influence to recommend Christianity to our world is a well-ordered and well-disciplined Christian family? The world sees that they believe God's Word.--Manuscript 13, 1888. (A sermon preached in the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Des Moines, Iowa, December 1, 1888. Reported by W. E. Cornell. Portions of this manuscript appear in Evangelism, 7BC, This Day With God, Our High Calling, and Manuscript Releases 347 and 749.) (MR 900.26)",
