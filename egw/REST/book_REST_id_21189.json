    "word": "You are to be house-band in your home. You need not be a spiritual weakling at home or in the church, but a stalwart son of God, prepared through vital connection with God for all the circumstances of actual life.

Your wife will walk interestedly by your side; but your indifference, your manifest want of devotion, gives no strength of spirituality to your wife and her mother.",
