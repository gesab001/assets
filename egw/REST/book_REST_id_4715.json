    "word": "Prosy, sermonizing prayers are uncalled for and out of place in public. A short prayer, offered in fervor and faith, will soften the hearts of the hearers; but during long prayers they wait impatiently, as if wishing that every word might end it. Had the minister making such a prayer wrestled with God in his chamber until he felt that his faith could grasp the promise, \"Ask, and it shall be given you,\" he would in his public prayer have come to the point at once, asking with earnestness and faith for grace for himself and his hearers.",
