    "word": "The apostle was bidden to write, \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.\" From this we can see that every one is not to be raised up, and if they are not raised to health, they should not be judged as unworthy of eternal life. If Jesus, the world's Redeemer, prayed, \"O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,\" and added, \"nevertheless not as I \n\n\n                        -48- \n\nwill, but as thou wilt,\" how very appropriate it is for finite mortals to make the same surrender to the wisdom and will of God.",
