    "word": "Recently a scene was presented before me. I was in our restaurant in San Francisco. It was Friday, and the workers were busily engaged in putting up packages of such foods as could well be transported. A \n\n\n             -227- \n\nnumber of people stood waiting to receive these packages. I asked the meaning of this, and the workers said, \"Some of our patrons were much troubled because they could not get their meals here on the Sabbath. They told us of the injury their health would suffer if they could not do this. They felt the benefit of the wholesome meals that they received here during the week, and were loud in protest against being denied them on the Sabbath. The result you see. For those who desire it, we put up on Friday a simple lunch, enough to serve over the Sabbath, and this they take with them.\"",
