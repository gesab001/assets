    "word": "The church generally at Battle Creek have not sustained the Institute by their example. They have not honored the light of health reform by carrying it out in their families. The sickness that has attended many families in Battle Creek need not have been, if they had followed the light God has given them. Like ancient Israel, they have disregarded the light, and could see no more necessity of restricting their appetite than did ancient Israel. The children of Israel would have flesh-meats, and said as many now say, We should die without meat. God gave rebellious Israel flesh, and his curse with it. Thousands of them died while the meat they desired was between their teeth. We have the example of ancient Israel, and the warning for us not to do as they did. Their history of unbelief and rebellion is left on record as a special warning that we should not follow their example of murmuring at God's requirements. How can we pass on so indifferently, choosing our own course, and following the sight of our own eyes, and \n                                                                           19\ndeparting farther and farther from God as did the Hebrews? God cannot do great things for his people because of their hardness of heart and sinful unbelief.",
