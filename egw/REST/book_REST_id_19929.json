    "word": "\"The son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost\" (Luke 19:10). There is a prescription for all who are so rigid in regard to a brother's wrong, when their own record stands in the books of heaven charged with unconfessed sins. You may ask, What can I do? Listen to the Great Teacher: \"How think ye? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, He rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish\" (Matthew 18:12-14). The lessons of this chapter it is for the interest of all to study and practice.",
