    "word": "God has claims upon all three of you, which you cannot lightly throw aside. Jesus has bought you with the price of his own blood. \"Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" Have you no sacrifice to make for God? Great responsibilities stand in the passages of your every-day life. Your record is daily passing up to God. Great dangers lie hidden in your pathway. If I could, I would take you in my arms and bear you safely over them; but this I am not permitted to do. Your are in the most critical period of your life-history. If you arouse and direct the energies of the soul after things of eternal interest, and if you make everything subordinate to this, you will make a success of perfecting Christian characters. You may all engage in the spiritual warfare against besetting sins, and you may, through Christ, come off victors. \n                                                                           55\nBut this is no child's play. It is a stern warfare, involving self-denial and cross-bearing. Your dangers are that you will not fully realize your backslidings and your perilous condition. Unless you view life as it is, cast aside your brilliant fancies of imagination, and come down to the sober lessons of experience, you will awake when it is too late. You will then realize the terrible mistake you have made.",
