    "word": "Chapter XXII. - Removal to Saratoga Springs.\n\n     Our conference at West Milton was held in a barn. It was well filled, and was an interesting and profitable meeting. We tarried at Ballston Spa a number of weeks, until we became settled in regard to publishing at Saratoga Springs. We then rented a house, and sent for Bro. and Sr. Belden, and Sr. Bonfoey who was then in Maine taking care of little Edson, and with borrowed household stuff we commenced house keeping.",
