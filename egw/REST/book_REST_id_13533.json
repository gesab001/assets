    "word": "There is many a man in the humble walks of life today whom the Lord might designate as He did Abraham: \"The friend of God.\" Such men approve that which God approves and condemn that which He condemns. In their presence even the sinner feels a sense of awe, a restraint; for God is with them, and they are living epistles, known and read of all men. There is a softened tenderness, a dignity, a divine propriety, in their deportment, which gives them power over the hearts of their fellow men.",
