    "word": "We are in days of trial, and the adversary of souls is upon our track. While we stand out separate from the world, how tenderly we should press close together in faith, in love doing one another good. United we are strong, divided we are weak. When Christ is abiding in us we shall have sweet communion with Him. We shall not be seeking to build up self, and will not have an overestimate of our own abilities; we will humble ourselves. We will not find fault with others, and we shall be very careful lest we entertain thoughts in our \n\n\n                -21- \n\nhearts against our brethren and injure their influence. Satan will constantly tempt us to do this. How can it look in the sight of heaven, in the presence of holy beings, to be continually finding fault with your brethren?",
