    "word": "The Good Health places the crib too high to meet the demands of uninformed men and women. There must be greater simplicity and we must make that journal a living thing, full of interesting matter to do its work on the Pacific Coast. . . .

He may criticize it as much as he pleases, as Trall criticized the Health Reformer; nevertheless, it shall live.--Letter 10, 1887.",
