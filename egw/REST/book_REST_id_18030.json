    "word": "The spirit and power Elijah have been stirring hearts to reform, and directing them to the wisdom of the just. Bro. and sister Ross have not been converted to the health reform, notwithstanding the amount of evidence God has given upon this subject. Self-denial is essential to genuine religion. Those who have not learned to deny themselves are destitute of vital, practical godliness. We cannot expect anything else but that the claims of religion will come in contact with the natural affections and worldly interest. There is work in the vineyard of the Lord for all and every one to do. None should be idle. \n                                                                           89\nAngels of God are all astir, ascending to Heaven, and descending to earth again with messages of mercy and warning. The heavenly messengers are moving upon minds and hearts. There are men and women whose hearts are susceptible of being inspired with the truth, everywhere. If men and women who have a knowledge of the truth would now work in unison with the Spirit of God, we should see a great work accomplished.",
