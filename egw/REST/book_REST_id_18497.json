    "word": "If in a pleasant manner you correct the wrongs you may see in other youth, sometimes reading to them lessons from the life of Christ, and presenting the requirements of the Word of God, you may assist greatly in correcting the irregularities that are always liable to occur in a large school. If you kneel down and pray with them, the angels of God will be present, and your interest in their behalf will be a converting power. Impress upon their minds the thought that the Lord beholds with pleasure their efforts to become obedient, and that His blessing will rest upon all who will do their best to overcome their faults. As you seek in every way possible to help and encourage the younger students to overcome, you yourself will be helped to overcome your own defects of character.",
