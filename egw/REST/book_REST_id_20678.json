    "word": "The gospel is the manifestation of the grace of God to fallen man. Those who obey the Word of God will understand that by bearing much fruit they testify to the power of God. The tame, spiritless work which produces no fruit is no evidence of a living connection with God. Without heart religion, a love for God that is all-absorbing, how can men and women labor for souls, doing the work essential for genuine conversion? Until the heart is humble and contrite before God, until the sins which the Word of God denounces are put away, God's blessing cannot be given. Those who work successfully for God must learn the first principles of Christianity. Those who find that they do not love God with \n\n\n                                    -245- \n\nheart, soul, strength, and mind, might better go \"apart . . . and rest a while.\" They might better take up some other work until they breathe a higher, purer atmosphere; for God will not work with them until their hearts are purified through obeying His Word.",
