    "word": "Attitude of the Instructor \n\n     While the students must be ready to begin with lesser responsibilities and give evidence that they can be trusted, he [the instructor] should feel for them the tenderest affection. He should not become discouraged at their ignorance, but should give them credit for all the good qualities he sees in them. In educating himself in this direction, he is obtaining a valuable experience--an experience which he needs in order to be a practical Christian.",
