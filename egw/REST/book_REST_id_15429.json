    "word": "In the days of Christ the religious leaders of the people felt that they were rich in spiritual treasure. The prayer of the Pharisee, \"God, I thank Thee, that I am not as the rest of men\" (Luke 18:11, R.V.), expressed the feeling of his class and, to a great degree, of the whole nation. But in the throng that surrounded Jesus there were some who had a sense of their spiritual poverty. When in the miraculous \n                                                                           7\ndraft of fishes the divine power of Christ was revealed, Peter fell at the Saviour's feet, exclaiming, \"Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord\" (Luke 5:8); so in the multitude gathered upon the mount there were souls who, in the presence of His purity, felt that they were \"wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked\" (Revelation 3:17); and they longed for \"the grace of God that bringeth salvation\" (Titus 2:11). In these souls, Christ's words of greeting awakened hope; they saw that their lives were under the benediction of God.",
