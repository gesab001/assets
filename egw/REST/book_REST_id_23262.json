Let the talent that is among us be combined wisely for the accomplishment of the greatest good. \"Ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.\" Then link up the powers that God has given for the doing of the special work he designs to have done. If self, is kept humble, the transforming grace of Christ and His wisdom will blend heart to heart. Let us make our gifts and offerings with a single heart. Let us draw upon our talents remembering that for this purpose they were given. To every man God has given His work; and He would have this work done intelligently. The Lord will make it possible for each to do a work that can be accepted by Him. \n                                                                           265",
