    "word": "Elder Stockman was preaching, and he was dying with the consumption. He talked as though inspired by the Holy Spirit, feeble as he was. I always sat on the front seat next to the stand, and as I heard a noise like a groan I saw that Elder Brown was as white as human flesh could be, and he was falling out of his chair. I suppose my interested look to him called the attention of Stockman, and he looked around, and he [Brown] was ready to fall on the floor. He [Stockman] turned around, and said, \"Excuse me,\" and took him in his arms, and laid him down on the lounge. He was one that did not believe in these things, and he had a taste of it right there. The power of the truth came upon him so.",
