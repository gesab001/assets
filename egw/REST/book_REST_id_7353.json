    "word": "What God shall do with these apparently uninteresting youth, you do not know. God has accepted and chosen, in the past, just such specimens to do a great work for Him. His Spirit, operating upon the heart, has acted like an electric battery, arousing the apparently benumbed faculties to vigorous and persevering action. The Lord saw in these rough, uninteresting, unhewn stones precious metal that will endure the test of storm \n\n\n                                                 199 \n\nand tempest and the fiery ordeal of heat. God seeth not as man seeth, God judgeth not as man judgeth--He searcheth the heart.--MS 2, 1881.",
