    "word": "Intemperance in eating and drinking, intemperance in labor, intemperance in almost everything,  exists on every hand. Those who make great exertions to accomplish just so much in a given time, and  continue to labor when their judgment tells them they ought to rest, are never gainers. They are expending force that they will need at a future time. When the energy which they have so recklessly used is called for, they fail for lack of it. Physical strength is gone, and mental power is unavailable. Their time of need has come, and their resources are exhausted.",
