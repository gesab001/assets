    "word": "Monday morn we had another meeting; the power of God rested upon us. I was taken off in vision and saw many things. I saw that Brother Baker must not sink down, that God had a work for him to do, not to feed the dogs, but the starving sheep. Feed the sheep, feed the sheep, said my accompanying angel. It was a melting, weeping time when I related the vision. Bro. Baker was comforted and made strong.--Letter 8, 1851, p. 5. (To Brother and Sister Howland, November 12, 1851.)",
