    "word": "The first night after we came here [Rochester, New York] I dreamed of being at Dansville and of the power of God resting upon me in such abundance that I was nearly lost to everything around me, and I was exalting God and our Saviour as the great Physician and the Deliverer of His afflicted, suffering children.
