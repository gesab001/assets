    "word": "In efforts made in large cities one half of the effort is lost because they close up the work too soon and go to a new field. Paul labored long in his fields, continuing his work for one year in one place and one year and a half in another place. The haste to close up an effort has frequently resulted in a great loss. Never weary the hearers by long discourses. This is not wise. For many years I have been laboring on this point, seeking to have our brethren sermonize less and devote their time and strength to making important points of truth plain, for every point will be assailed by our opponents. Everyone connected with the work should keep fresh ideas. They should not allow themselves to become merely spectators, but interested workers watching for opportunities to speak with souls, to come close to them by personal, interested efforts. By tact and foresight bring all that is possible into your work to interest your hearers, but avoid long sermons, for they soon weary of this. They want a diversity of labor.",
