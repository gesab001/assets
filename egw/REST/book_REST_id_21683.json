    "word": "How is it so natural for us to pour out all our soul troubles and perplexities upon finite beings as ourselves? I leave you to answer the question. Why do we do this? [The practice might be excusable] if we had not the promise, \"Ask and receive,\" and \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" It is not \"My yoke\" that makes your work so hard, that makes your journey so difficult.",
