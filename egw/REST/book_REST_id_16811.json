    "word": "There is a great work to be done in Europe. All heaven takes an interest not only in lands that are nigh and that need our help, but in lands that are afar off. All the inhabitants of heaven are in active service, ministering to a fallen world. They take a deep and fervent interest in the salvation of men, the fallen inhabitants of \n\n\n                      -15- \n\nthis world. These heavenly beings are watching and waiting for human agencies to be deeply moved over their fellow workmen who are in perplexity and trial and sorrow and distress. Human agencies are called to be hand-helpers, to work out the knowledge and use the faculties of heavenly angels. By uniting with these powers that are omnipotent, we shall be benefited by their higher education and experience. The Lord's entrusted talents will be efficacious, if used to do the work entrusted to his institutions, that they may stand again in independence. All heaven is watching those agencies that have been as the hand to work out the purposes of God in the earth, thus doing the will and purpose of God in heaven. Such a co-operation will accomplish a work which will give honor and glory and majesty to God.",
