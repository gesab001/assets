    "word": "\"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning.\" Well this is what we wanted to know, Where we can find the light? It will break forth as the \n\n\n                                    -35- \n\nmorning! What is it that will give us the light? By getting out of ourselves and seeing what good we can do for others, that are around us. We may feel that it is too great a task upon us, but in doing good to others it reacts back upon us, and if we comfort others with the comfort wherewith we are comforted the blessings will come back to us. And how? \"Ye are labourers together with God.\" You see we are drawing in the same line with Jehovah, and all of the heavenly intelligences are interested in the work going on here in this earth, and if there had not been that interest none of us could be saved. . . . \"And they that shall be of thee,\" now mark these words, \"shall build the old waste places\": What next? They shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and they shall be called, What? \"The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.\" What is that? It is the everlasting law of Jehovah, and it was the transgression of that [law] that brought the fall of man.",
