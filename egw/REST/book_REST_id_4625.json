    "word": "How to Treat the Erring\n     \u201cBrethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\u201d [Galatians 6:1.] Here is a special direction to deal tenderly with those overtaken in a fault. This word \u201covertaken\u201d must have its full significance. It describes something different from deliberate sin; it applies to one who is led into sin unawares through want of watchfulness and prayer, not discerning the temptation of Satan, and so falling into his snare. There is a difference to be made in the case of one who deliberately enters into temptation, who marks out an evil course, covering his sins skillfully, that he may not be detected. More decisive measures are needed to check the premeditated sin; but the apostle directs the treatment \n398\nto be given to those who are \u201covertaken\u201d or surprised, or overcome by temptation. \u201cYe which are spiritual,\u201d you who have a connection with God, \u201crestore such a one in the spirit of meekness,\u201d \u2014do not crush all hope and courage out of the soul, but restore him in meekness, \u201cconsidering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\u201d Faithful reproofs will be needed, and kindly counsel and supplications to God to bring him to see his sin and danger.",
