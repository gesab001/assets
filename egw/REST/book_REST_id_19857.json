    "word": "Dear Children: All well as usual. Father slept splendidly last night. We all rested well. Father enjoyed his breakfast this morning. He ate quite heartily. Mary obtained some nice graham flour at Cheyenne. And we have now warm gruel at our meals. Father is cheerful and we think much better, if we can judge by appearances, than when he left home. We get to Ogden tonight at half past six o'clock. We have plenty to eat. We get hot water to fill the tin can and it keeps warm all night. Filled in the morning it keeps warm all day. Mary is an excellent general on such a trip. She manages splendidly.",
