    "word": "Who gives us the sunshine which makes the earth bring forth and bear? and who the fruitful showers? Who has given us the heavens above and the sun and stars in the heavens? Who gave you your reason, and who keeps watch over you from day to day? Is it not the God of heaven who has created the worlds, and who rested upon the seventh day? He blessed this day and made it holy, and is it more than justice that we respect the day upon which He has set His blessing? Every time we look at the world we are reminded of the mighty hand of God which called it into existence.--Ms 16, 1895, p. 5. (Untitled, October 20, 1895.) \n\nReleased September 23, 1976.",
