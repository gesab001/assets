    "word": "MR No. 1002 - THE BAKER LETTER\n\n     [MOST OF \"THE BAKER LETTER\" HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN EARLIER MANUSCRIPT RELEASES. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS LETTER HAS BECOME A FOCAL POINT IN THE CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS ON CHRIST'S HUMAN NATURE, THE TRUSTEES FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE WISE TO RELEASE IT ALL, SO THAT INTERESTED STUDENTS MAY HAVE IT IN ITS COMPLETE FORM. THAT WHICH APPEARS HERE IN SMALLER TYPE HAS ALREADY BEEN INCLUDED IN PREVIOUS RELEASES. WE REPEAT ARTHUR L. WHITE'S INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT TO MANUSCRIPT RELEASE #414.--K. H. WOOD.]",
