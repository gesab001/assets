    "word": "So we see Christ identifies His interests with fallen man. He turns to those on the left hand and says, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in: naked, and ye clothed Me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited Me not.\" And when they asked Him, \"When saw we Thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee?\" the answer comes, \"Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me.\" (Matthew 25:34-46.) Not the greatest, but the least.",
