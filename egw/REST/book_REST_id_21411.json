    "word": "There is to be no self-exaltation among God's people. He will not tolerate self-righteousness. \"Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool: where is the house that ye build unto Me? and where is the place of My rest? For all those things hath Mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word\" (Isaiah 66:1, 2). The Lord is to be glorified and adored, but man is never to seek to be glorified by man or to glorify himself.",
