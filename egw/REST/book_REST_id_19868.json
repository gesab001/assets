    "word": "Bible Teaching in SDA Schools Not to Be Restricted to One Man--In our schools the work of opening the Scriptures to the students is not to be left to only one teacher. This would not be wisdom. Other minds should be brought in. One man may seem well able to present the truth, and yet this is not evidence that he should teach the students from the Word of God term after term. Others should aid in this work, for it is a great work.--Ms. 158, 1898, pp. 3, 4. (\"The Gift of the Holy Spirit,\" Dec. 7, 1898.)",
