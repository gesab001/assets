    "word": "Be Not Weary in Well-Doing \n\n     I am glad that there has been such harmonious effort to carry out the purpose of God and to make the most of His providence. This effort to circulate Christ's Object Lessons is demonstrating what can be done in the canvassing field. To ministers, students, fathers, mothers, young men, and young women who have engaged in this work I would say: Let not your interest flag. Let this good work go forward steadily, perseveringly, grandly, till the last debt is removed from all our schools and a fund is created for the establishment of schools in important fields, where there is great need of educational work.",
