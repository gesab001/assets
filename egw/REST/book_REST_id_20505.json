    "word": "MR No. 1204 - The Church in the Home\n\n     Children have not been instructed as God has declared they should be. Blind affection has led many parents to walk contrary to the Word of God. Their spiritual eyesight has been blinded, and their children have grown up undisciplined and unrestrained, a care, a burden, and a reproach to those who should faithfully have trained them. Such children are described by the apostle Paul as being \"disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce despisers of all that is good.\" [SEE 2 TIMOTHY 3:3 IN A MODERN TRANSLATION.]",
