    "word": "Disappointment and a dearth of success will be the result of settling in any location surrounded by the residences of the great men of the world, for if they do not accept the light all their powers will be used by Satan to extinguish the light that God designs shall shine forth. This will greatly hinder the progress of the work. Select places for your educational and medical work where the Sun of Righteousness can arise with healing in His wings. The more closely Christ is followed, the more wonderfully God will work to restore suffering humanity.",
