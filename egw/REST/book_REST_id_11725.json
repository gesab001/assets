    "word": "The multitude of deformed and sickly, pressing for the earthly crown, are those whose interests and treasures are in this world, and, although they are disappointed on every side, they will not place their affections on Heaven, and secure to themselves a treasure and home there. They fail of the earthly, yet while in pursuit of it, lose the heavenly. Notwithstanding the disappointment, and unhappy life, and death, of those who were wholly bent upon obtaining earthly riches, others follow the same course in their pursuit for earthly treasures. They rush madly on, disregarding the miserable end of those whose example they are following.",
