    "word": "All the religious exercises of the home life should be of a cheering and encouraging nature. The physician or nurse who is easily offended, or who cherishes a jealous or suspicious disposition, is not prepared to take responsibilities in our institutions for the sick. Such influences will counterwork the best efforts that can be made to bring in a cheering and uplifting atmosphere. Our sanitariums are to be regarded as sacred places; the spiritual interests of the patients are to be carefully watched, and any influences that should injure should be removed. The men and women who care for the sick should be truly converted; then they will speak words that will help and uplift.",
