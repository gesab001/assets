    "word": "(En route to Battle Creek) Friday, Feb. 28, 1873--It is a beautiful day. We all rested well during the night. I became very sick--headache, stomach sickness. Ate but little through the day. We had pleasant company on the train. My husband felt unusually well. Sister Hall was troubled with pain in her limbs. We saw snow, the first we had seen during the winter.--Ms. 4, 1873, p. 13. (Diary, February 27, 28, 1873.)",
