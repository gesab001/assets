    "word": "MR No. 1206 - Selection of the School Land at Cooranbong\n\n     We are very grateful to our God that the land that has been cleared and cultivated in the school ground has produced such excellent fruit and vegetables. Our hearts have been made sad by the false witness which has been borne. This has not helped us to battle with the discouragements which we were compelled to wrestle with. When every voice and pen should have been engaged in encouraging us and lifting up our hands, reports that were false were sent to our friends in Africa, placing in a wrong light the efforts made by those who were struggling to clear and break the land preparatory to setting in the trees.",
