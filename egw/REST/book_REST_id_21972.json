    "word": "It is Christ's purpose to enlighten our understanding, that we may know \"what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power\" to all who deny self, and taking up the cross, follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Words can not express the blessedness of following His guidance. He pledges himself to work with those who strive to represent Him in thought, word, and deed. He gives them assurances to encourage them when they are cast down. He speaks words that will uplift them, but He never designs to exalt them in their own estimation. He gives them the earnest of His Spirit, recognizing their meekness in wearing His yoke. \"Learn of Me,\" He says, \"and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" Holiness of heart and works and spirit is obtained through a belief of the truth.",
