    "word": "To those who love Christ, the Bible is as the garden of God; whose promises are as grateful to the heart as the fragrance of flowers to the senses. Then take up your Bibles, and with fresh interest, begin to study the sacred records of the Old and New Testaments. Work the field of precious truth, until you have a deeper comprehension of the mercy and love of God, who gave His only-begotten Son to the world, that through Him we might have life.--Lt 31, 1891. (SpTWWPP 32-34.)",
