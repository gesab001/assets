    "word": "Christ teaches humanity never to be self-sufficient. He says, \"Learn of me; . . . I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:29). Learn of the One who was meek and lowly in heart--the One who has promised, \"Ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" This glorious experience will come, and you can say, \"I know Him! I know Him! I have tested Him; I have proved Him, and He has never failed me.\" . . .",
