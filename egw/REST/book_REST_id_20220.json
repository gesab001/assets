    "word": "From the school farm we drove to the sanitarium. I am much interested in this institution. It is built on the mountainside, in the midst of a grove of trees. There are pine, oak, chestnut, hickory, and many other varieties of beautiful trees. With proper care this grove can be made very beautiful. It is as healthful a location for a sanitarium as I have ever seen. It is a place that you would delight in. The view from the top story is very fine. I was taken to the spring, which is a little farther up the mountain. This spring gives an abundance of soft, pure water, and is a treasure of inestimable worth.",
