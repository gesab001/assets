    "word": "Brethren Rousseau and Daniells had propositions to lay before us that land selected for the locating of the school was not as good land as we should have on which to erect buildings; we should be disappointed in the cultivation of the land; it was not rich enough to produce good crops, etc., etc. This was surprising intelligence to us and we could not view the matter in the same light. We knew we had evidence that the Lord had directed in the purchase of the land. They proposed searching still for land. Already much money and much time and anxiety had been expended in searching for suitable land and there were objectionable features in all places they investigated. The land purchased was the best, as far as advantages were concerned. To go back on this and begin another search meant loss of time, expense in outlay of means, great anxiety and uneasiness, and delay in locating the school, putting us back one year. We could not see light in this. We thought of the children of Israel who inquired, Can God set a table in the wilderness? He did do this, and with God's blessing resting upon the school the land will be blessed and will produce good crops.",
