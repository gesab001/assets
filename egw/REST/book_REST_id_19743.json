    "word": "Change in lines of study in the schools is essential, and an intelligent growing knowledge. The mind must not be overtaxed with long application in one special lesson. It is not beneficial to the teacher, neither is it beneficial to the student. It becomes monotonous. Some can bear this concentrated effort: others become nervous, but do not understand the reason; but variety in daily studies is more restful to the brain than one monotonous line of study. Break it up: divert the mind: change it to different subjects, lest the monotony of one line of work disqualify the person for meeting the exigencies that will arise. \n\n\n                                    -303-",
