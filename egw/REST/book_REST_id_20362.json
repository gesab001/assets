    "word": "Christ will accomplish that which He has undertaken, if man, the human agent, will cooperate with Him, if he will not resist and refuse the great salvation offered to him. He has undertaken to save us. Shall we be saved? Will we commit the keeping of our souls to Him who hath identified His interests in so remarkable a manner with our interests? If we will accept Christ as our personal Saviour, He will elevate and cleanse us from all moral defilement, and He will present us faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy. He will say to the Father, \"Here are those whom Thou hast given Me. I will that they also be with Me where I am; that they may behold My glory.\" \n\n\n                                    -104-",
