    "word": "Those who deny self to do others good, and who devote themselves and all they have to Christ's service, will realize the happiness which the selfish man seeks for in vain. Said our Saviour: \"Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple.\" Luke 14:33. Charity \"seeketh not her own.\" This is the fruit of that disinterested love and benevolence which characterized the life of Christ. The law of God in our hearts will bring our own interests in subordination to high and eternal considerations.  3T 397521",
