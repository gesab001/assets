    "word": "Last Wednesday I left St. Helena for Los Angeles, accompanied by my son Willie, Clarence Crisler, Sara McEnterfer, and Maggie Hare, to attend the Southern California camp meeting. We spent Wednesday, September 10, in Oakland, and at 7:00 o'clock in the evening took the cars again. At 8:00 o'clock, September 11, the next morning, we reached Santa Barbara, where we spent the greater part of the day looking over the city to see if it would be a suitable place in which to establish a sanitarium and start a hygienic restaurant. We are starting these restaurants in many cities, that we may teach the people the value of a health-reform diet. No meat, tea, or coffee are served in our restaurants. The fare is wholesome and nourishing, and is made up of grains, vegetables, nuts, and fruits. We endeavor to demonstrate to those who come the advantage of a diet of this kind over a flesh diet.",
