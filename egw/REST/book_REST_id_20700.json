    "word": "I feel an intense desire that more shall be done to warn the world of the coming of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. I want to do all in my power to arouse our brethren to resist the temptation to erect many food factories and food stores for the manufacture and sale of health foods. There is danger that the minds of those engaged in the health food work will become absorbed in commercial interests. The attention of young and old will be given to these interests, and the proclamation of the gospel message will be neglected. At this time we need men who are filled with zeal for the circulation of our larger books.",
