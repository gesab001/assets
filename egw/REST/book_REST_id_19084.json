    "word": "Please write if you intended that the boys should have steady employment in the office until your return. Henry says you told him he could do as he pleased, work in the office or about home, after the hurry was over in the office. I told Henry I did not so understand it. I thought one day each week could be spent about home, the rest of the time in the office. Please write your wishes and all will be well. We want to follow as you think best in these things. I do not see much to be done at home.--Letter 12a, 1860, p. 2. (To James White, October, 1860.)",
