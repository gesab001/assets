    "word": "Many have, as had Moses, very much to unlearn in order to learn the very lessons that they need to learn. He had need to be self-trained by severest mental and moral discipline and God wrought with him before he could be fitted to train others in mind and heart. He had been instructed in the Egyptian courts. Nothing was left as unnecessary to train him to become a general of armies. The false theories of the idolatrous Egyptians had been instilled into his mind, and the influences surrounding him and things his eyes looked upon could not be easily shaken off or corrected. Thus it is with many who have had a false training in any line. All the idolatrous rubbish of heathen lore must be removed--bit by bit, item by item--from Moses' mind. Jethro helped him in many things to a correct faith, as far as he himself understood. He was working upward toward the light when he could see God in singleness of heart. God Jehovah was revealed to him. This thorough intellectual training in Egypt, \n\n\n                                     -326- \n\nand as a shepherd among the mountains, in the pure air, made him a strong thinker and a strong doer of the Word of God.",
