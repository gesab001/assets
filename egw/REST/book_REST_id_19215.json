    "word": "In the afternoon I spoke to the people in reference to the responsibility resting upon the church to let the light shine to others, that God had permitted to shine upon them. If they valued the truth and salvation that they were partakers of, they should be interested to help others to receive the great blessing they were enjoying. In every town, city, and village there are hearts susceptible to truth, and if those who profess the truth would meekly and judiciously recommend the same by their consistent lives, many would yield obedience to its requirements and take their position with the people of God. The responsibility of this great work should \n\n\n                                    -221- \n\nbe felt and shared by all who profess to be followers of Jesus. Very much depends upon those who have the light in their possession. The work must be carried forward by those who believe. They should give themselves to the work with greater earnestness and energy. Nothing can be done without exertion and diligence.",
