    "word": "A telegram came from Melbourne last Thursday for Elder Haskell to attend the camp meeting there, but it is impossible for him to do so. The interest here requires all the force we have here, and even more helpers than we have here now. Not one can be spared. The class who are now becoming interested and taking their stand for the truth are those who will be able to assist in the financial part of the work, and also with their influence in helping to reach other souls. We feel very thankful to God for this encouragement. We are now hearing that precious souls are being moved by the Holy Spirit. We will continue to work and pray as well.",
