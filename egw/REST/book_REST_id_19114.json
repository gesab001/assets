    "word": "But do not make any movements now to change responsibilities, that will create issues just at this time that will be unfavorable to the instruction of the youth in the very lines that they need to be receiving in every grade.

When your school interests should be transferred, it will be at a time that will not mean defeat, but victory, climbing up the upward grade.",
