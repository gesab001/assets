    "word": "One time when we were in Healdsburg, we heard reports that cast a shadow on the integrity of Brother Cady. I met these with the remark that I had confidence in Brother Cady, and it must be that they were mistaken in the matter of the report. There was another matter regarding his relation to the school that had troubled me much. I thought a mistake had been made in proposing that he should work in the interest of all the schools in general. I felt that his place in the Healdsburg school could not then be properly supplied. I felt that the Healdsburg school should have the continual influence that Brother and Sister Cady would exert. I considered that he had done a good work in this school, and I greatly feared that the school would not succeed as it had done, were he separated from it.",
