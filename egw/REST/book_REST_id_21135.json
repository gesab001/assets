    "word": "When our teachers shall think less of great I, and be more deeply interested in the prosperity and success of their pupils, having a sense that they are God's property--that they must render an account to Him for every impression made upon the mind and for the mold given to the character--we shall have a school that will attract angels. Jesus will look lovingly upon the work of the teachers, and will send His grace into the hearts of the students.",
