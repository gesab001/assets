    "word": "Students, you know not in what position you may be placed. God may use you as He used Daniel to take the knowledge of the truth to the mighty of the earth. It rests with you to say whether you will have knowledge and skill. God can give you skill in all your learning. He can help you to adapt yourselves to the line of study you shall take up. Place yourselves in right relation to God. Make this your first interest. Gather up right principles, noble principles, uplifting principles. Then when visitors come to the school, they will be impressed that the students are receiving the right education. God desires you to be witnesses for Him. He desires you to draw in right lines. As you do this, he will give you skill and wisdom and \n\n\n                                     -317- \n\nunderstanding. You will advance step by step, for God does not want you to stand still. He wants you to run in the way of His commandments, constantly moving forward and upward.",
