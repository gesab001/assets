    "word": "Many rich men have obtained their wealth by close deal, by advantaging themselves and disadvantaging their poorer fellow men or their brethren; and these very men glory in their shrewdness and keenness in a bargain. But the curse of God will rest upon every dollar thus obtained, and upon the increase of it in their hands. As these things were shown me, I could see the force of our Saviour's words: \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Those who possess the ability to acquire property need to be constantly on the watch or they will turn their acquisitiveness to bad account and not maintain strict honesty. Thus many fall into temptation, overreach, receive more for a thing than it is worth, and sacrifice the generous, benevolent, noble principles of their manhood for sordid gain.",
