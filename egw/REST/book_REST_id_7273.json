    "word": "The marriage institution was designed of Heaven to be a blessing to man; but, in a general sense, it has been abused in such a manner as to make it a dreadful curse. Most men and women have acted in entering the marriage relation as though the only question for them to settle was whether they loved each other. But they should realize that a responsibility rests upon them in the marriage relation farther than this. They should consider whether their offspring will possess physical health, and mental and moral strength. But few have moved with high motives, and with elevated considerations which they could not lightly throw off-- that society had claims upon them, that the weight of their family's influence would tell in the upward or downward scale.--\"A Solemn Appeal,\" pp. 63, 64 (Edition: Signs Publishing Company Limited).",
