    "word": "The words spoken by our Instructors impressed me deeply. Of those who lead tried and tempted lives the question was asked, \"How do you deal with your difficulties? Do you harness yourself for an encounter with trial and temptation? And then do you lay hold on these temptations, as you suppose you must, while your spirit is hot within you, and wrestle with them, quite sure that this is what you ought to do? As you battle with your covetousness and uncharitableness on their own ground, do you come out victor? No; you come out discouraged, bruised, and wounded, bound and enfeebled spiritually.",
