    "word": "I find that there is nothing like coming close to persons and seeking to help them by individual effort, but it is not always an easy pleasant task; but this seems to be my work which I cannot get rid of. \n                                                                           385\nWe pray for you daily and the Lord does hear our prayers and answers them. We need the intelligence you have in our work and we shall make our request to God for your life, your health to be restored that you can engage with us in the work. But all you are required to do now is to be happy, cheerful, hopeful in God and comfortable. We want that you shall have every convenience. Many prayers are sent up to heaven for you and we do not forget Elder Olsen in our prayers.",
