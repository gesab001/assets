What more can be said than has been said? I have all the letters I have written to you, therefore I am not ignorant of the mind and will of God. I beg of you, do not go into the Health Retreat with your miscalculations and preconceived notions. You cannot help them there. Self must first be crucified.--Letter 21c, 1892. \n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. April 13, 1989. Entire Letter.",
