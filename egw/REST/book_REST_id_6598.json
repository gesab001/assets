    "word": "If when you ask, you do not immediately feel any special exercise of feeling, do not think that your prayer is not answered. The One who says, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened,\" will hear and answer you. Let then His Word be your trust, ask and seek, and have the privilege of finding. Christ has encouraged you. He says, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you\"--the yoke of restraint and obedience--\"and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\"",
