    "word": "We traveled until one o'clock and then were transferred to the boat. We had our stateroom, but it was so arranged that it was not a protection from the tobacco poison. At this late hour--or early hour of morning--men were fumigating themselves with the tobacco smoke which filled our stateroom with the disagreeable, sickening smell. We could obtain but little sleep and felt unrefreshed, unrested the next day.--Ms 65, 1886, p. 2. (Second visit to Sweden, Diary, June 15 to July 1, 1886.)",
