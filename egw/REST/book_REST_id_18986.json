    "word": "Every soul of man may be saved if they believe in Christ as their personal Saviour. All will not be saved. Not because He does not want them to be saved, for He is drawing every soul whatever may be their position, whatever may be their education, their nationality, or their training, He is drawing every soul to Himself. Why? Because in Him is life and light and truth, and all of these are essential to us for our happiness daily in this present life, and all these things are going to help us bear the burdens and trials and perplexities of life with greater ease, and Christ says in his invitation, \"Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest.\" . . .",
