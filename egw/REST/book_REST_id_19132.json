    "word": "We long to be with you, to speak to the people as the Lord might give us utterance, but there is work to be done, not only in that great and wicked city, but almost everywhere. We hope and pray that your efforts may be highly successful. Do not forget that pulpit labor must be followed by private effort. Brother A ought not to bend his mind to much writing, now while this effort is being made. The greatest success attends those who come in as close relation as possible with those with whom they labor, gain their sympathy and confidence, visit in their homes those who appear interested, and pray with them and for them. In this way only will the direction be followed to go out in the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in.",
