    "word": "On Board the Train En route for California, 1877--Dear Children: All well as usual. Father slept more than he has done for many nights. He also slept over one hour through the day yesterday. It was a clear, cold night. No fire in the cars. We depended on a foot stone till we had no fire to warm it; then by much exertion we obtained our tin can of hot water. They would not let us or the porter have any hot water at Omaha. Sister Clemmens went to the restaurant, the depot and two private homes. All said they had none. Rum and liquor of all kinds could be obtained readily, but not a drop of hot water. Mary went to a hotel and obtained warm water, but not hot. This she had to heat herself and dared not wait longer for fear of being left. She then started out with a determination and went to a private house and succeeded in getting our can filled. This was fortunate for father's feet were almost freezing cold. The porter filled the can at night and it remained warm all night. He was comfortable. Today he is comfortable. All are crying out now at the prairie fires. Mary has cooked father's breakfast over the little stove and we have all had hot drink. She has just heated water to fill father's can. It is made hot and it will retain its heat a long time. Tell the tinner it is a complete success--size just right.--Letter 21, 1877, p. 1. (To Dear Children, October 11, 1877.) \n\n\n                                   -139-",
