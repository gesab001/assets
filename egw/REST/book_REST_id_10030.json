    "word": "Chap. 38 - Science and Revelation\n-\n\n     \"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.\" The mightiest intellects of earth cannot comprehend God. If He reveals Himself at all to men, it is by veiling Himself in mystery. His ways are past finding out. Men must be ever searching, ever learning; and yet there is an infinity beyond. Could they fully understand the purposes, wisdom, love, and character of God, they would not believe in Him as an infinite being, and trust Him with the interests of their souls. If they could fathom Him, He would no longer stand supreme.",
