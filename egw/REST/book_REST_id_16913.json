    "word": "We should have less preaching, and more teachings. As we approach nearer the end, I have seen that in our camp-meetings there will be less preaching and more Bible study,--little groups all over the ground with their Bibles in their hands, and different ones leading out in a free conversational study of the Scriptures. It has been shown me that our camp-meetings were to increase in interest and success. There are those who want more definite light than is received from the preaching of the Word. Some need a longer time than do others to understand the points presented. If the teaching could be made a little plainer, they would see the truth, take hold of it, and it would be like a nail fastened in a sure place.",
