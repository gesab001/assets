    "word": "Moss, Norway, [Friday] June 10, 1887. Arose at 4:00 a.m. After a season of prayer, commenced my writing. It is a pleasant day--some cloudy and not very warm. Rested quite well from 10:00 p.m. until 3:00 a.m. Could not sleep more. The sun has been shining brightly for half an hour. We met our friends from America and are glad to see them once more. Many are coming in to the meeting. . . .",
