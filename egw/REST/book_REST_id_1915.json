    "word": "Paul was a health reformer. Said he, \"I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\" He felt that a responsibility rested upon him to preserve all his powers in their strength, that he might use them to the glory of God. If Paul was in danger from intemperance, we are in greater danger, because we do not feel and realize as he did the necessity of glorifying God in our bodies and spirits, which are His. Overeating is the sin of this age.",
