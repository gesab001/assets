    "word": "I do not expect to visit Adelaide again, although this is not certain. I am fully pleased with the place. I think much of the people and am sore distressed when I consider how much might have been done that is not done because of unconsecrated workers. It is these thoughts that distress me and wear me, that our General Conference should make such unwise moves as have been made in sending Elder C here to Australia, and that the Conference in Australia should not have examined his work and changed this order of things. Now the neglect of doing that which was manifestly the duty of someone to do, has left a burden on this Conference to be especially liberal in doing a work now to redeem the past and make, as far as in their power, restitution for the past neglect, for Elder C is supposed to have the endorsement of the Conference, and thus leaves a guilt upon the Conference for sustaining a man who was remiss in his duty, unfaithful to his charge, giving lessons in dealing with the supposed erring, contrary to the Bible rule, which now have to be counteracted and an entirely different mold given to the church. This business is to me a sad and sorrowful one. And it is not a feeble effort or short work that can make a sufficient change and leave a healthful, wholesome influence in the church, which will be abiding.--Letter 84, 1892, p. 2. (To W. C. White, November 9, 1892.)",
