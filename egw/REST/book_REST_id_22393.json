    "word": "Elder Olsen,  I wish to say to you, You must not make any calculation for me to go to Africa, I see no light and consistency in such a move. It is time for me to find some retired place, and have quietude and rest of spirit. I have been in the turmoil of battle for fifty years, and I do not wish to hold on to the active service until I do not know when it is time to let go. I think that period has come when I must lay off cares and perplexities that meet me in new fields. I have some little strength yet left.",
