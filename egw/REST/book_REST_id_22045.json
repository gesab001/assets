    "word": "We all know better than to do as we have done. There is no excuse for this unchristlike spirit. If Christ were abiding in the soul we could not but reveal Christ's forbearance, Christ's courtesy, and the love of Christ. All this hard, unkind, uncourteous spirit manifested toward brethren is registered in the books of heaven as manifested toward Jesus Christ, for He identifies His interest with that of His brethren. \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" Matthew 25:40.",
