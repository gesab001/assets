    "word": "All who are laborers together with God should regard the salvation of souls as their highest interest. Self must be hid in Christ. The conversation should not take a pitying, self-righteous turn, for when this is done, Christ is eclipsed and self is made prominent. We interpose ourselves between Christ and those whose Christian experience is weak and who need help in many lines. Under this influence, those whom we try to help will in their turn exert a wrong influence, and will hinder the spiritual advancement of other souls.",
