    "word": "Dear Brother and Sister Hare: I am much interested in the work in Ashfield and Petersham. God has precious souls in these places, and this is why the work is meeting with so much opposition. Satan is determined to contest every point and every inch of the ground. But shall he gain the victory? We hope that you will answer, \"No, never.\" Gird on every piece of the armor that God has provided, and do not fail or be discouraged. Error must be presented in its deceptive and fatal character, and truth must be shown to be as firm as the eternal hills of God. . . .",
