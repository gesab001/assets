    "word": "The Battle Following Conversion \n     All heaven is interested in the work that has been going on in this wicked city of Nimes. Victories have been gained and souls have been wrenched from Satan's grasp. If there is a holding of these victories there will be the necessity of much help from above. If those newly come to the faith will feel their own weakness and depend upon Jesus for strength every hour then they can resist the deceptions of Satan and become God's witnesses upon the earth. There is not a soul won to Christ, . . .the message of the third angel does not make its way to a single heart, without defeat to the tempter, and bruising of the head of the serpent. This will arouse the malice of the adversary to greater activity. When the truth is received into the heart it commences its leavening, transforming process. Sin will appear hateful. That soul will, through faith and willing obedience to God's commandments, enlist in his behalf a strength more mighty than his own to combine with his human efforts to resist the enemy.",
