    "word": "\"Although now almost wholly in the possession of wicked men, all the world, with its riches and treasures, belongs to God. 'The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.' The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith the Lord of hosts.' 'Every beast of the forest is Mine, and all the birds of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof.' O that Christians might realize more and still more fully that it is their privilege and their duty, while cherishing right principles, to take advantage of every heaven-sent opportunity for advancing God's kingdom in this world!\" \n\n                                               -",
