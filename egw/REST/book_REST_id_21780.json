    "word": "I love Jesus. I see in Him matchless charms. I hold up before you the Man of Calvary. I want you to become acquainted with Him. And if you bring Him into your daily life, let me tell you, you will lose sight of the little perplexities here. Jesus says, \"Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" There is rest in Jesus. And if you see poor souls fretting and worrying, it is because they have not the yoke of Jesus on. Perhaps in that extra ruffle and that extra trimming they have neglected to let Jesus in. Says He, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me\" [Revelation 3:20].",
