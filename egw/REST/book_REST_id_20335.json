    "word": "Christ is the great Physician, not only of the body, but of the soul. He restores man to his God. God permitted His only begotten Son to be bruised, that healing properties might flow forth from Him to cure all our diseases. Physicians are to act in Christ's stead. Every physician who has planted his feet upon the Rock of Ages draws from the great Physician His restoring power. Christ's plans are to be carried out more definitely by the Christian physician.",
