    "word": "Christiania, Norway, [Monday] June 20, 1887. We left Moss yesterday morning. Carriages took us to the cars and we were three hours coming to this place. I lay down and slept some, but a great weariness is upon me. Carriages took us to Brother O. A. Olsen's and we had a good, convenient chance to rest. I was able to sit up but little, for I seemed to be nearly completely exhausted. I have no appetite.",
