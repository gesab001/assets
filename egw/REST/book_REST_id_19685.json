    "word": "The Lord gave me much freedom in speaking to these assembled under the tent, an intelligent-looking people that listened with deep interest. Brother M came twelve miles to the meeting with his wife. She has been a bitter opposer, and the features speak the bitterness of the spirit within, but we have hope she will yet go with her husband and daughter. Her daughter, about 18 years old, first took her stand, saying, \"Father, I must keep the Sabbath.\" He said, \"Daughter, if you feel it is your duty, do this, and I will support you in so doing.\" Next the father took his position firmly upon the truth. He called his large family together, grown-up boys and smaller children, and told them he had decided that the seventh day is the Sabbath, blessed of God and enjoined upon the human family to keep, that he would rejoice if his children and the mother also would all unite with him: but if they did not do this, they must understand that no work was to be done on his premises on the Sabbath. He has two large fruit orchards. He said that the horses must not work, his children must not work, for thus saith the commandment. The Bible must now be his guidebook. \"Now,\" said he, \"you know my word is law, and I shall expect you to refrain from all labor on my premises on the seventh day.\" We have strong hope that others of the family will unite with the father and the daughter. I could see that while I was speaking the opposing wife was somewhat affected. We hope for good. Brother M is a thoroughly converted man. His wife is a Wesleyan Methodist, and this class are generally bitter as gall against the truth.-- Ms 23, 1894 (New South Wales, April 9, 1894.)",
