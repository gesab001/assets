Never act or talk on the doubtful side, but let the weight of your words and acts be to strengthen faith, to dispel doubts. You have not realized for years the responsibility that rests upon you. God has given you a taste of eternal joys to lead you on, to reach out, to hope, to elevate, and bring you closer to himself. God requires you to look to these manifestations of his love. These abundant blessings were for some special object. Where much is given, much will be required. If your influence is governed by the Spirit of God, you can do much good; if it is not sanctified by the Spirit of God, it will tell much on the wrong side. You have felt too much that it was but a small matter or but little consequence what you may say or do. Take heed. There is more importance attached to these things than you have thought of. The grace of God can sanctify and purify your judgment, and together can you labor for the interest of God's cause. \n                                   E. G.
