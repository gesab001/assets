    "word": "Those who take Christ at His word and surrender their souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude. Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest. The Lord says, \"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee\" (Isaiah 26:3).",
