    "word": "The Lord gave us favor with the people, and we had many wonderful opportunities to demonstrate what could be done through the principles of health reform to restore to health those whose cases had been pronounced hopeless.  {TSDF 115.10}  \n     We should put forth greater efforts to teach the people the truths of health reform. At every camp-meeting an effort should be made to demonstrate what can be done in providing an appetizing, wholesome diet from grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. In every place where new companies are brought into the truth, instruction should be given in the science of preparing wholesome food. Workers should be chosen who can labor from house to house in an educational campaign.  {TSDF 115.11}  \n                                                      6 T.--112-113 \n     As we near the close of time, we must rise higher and still higher upon the question of health reform and Christian temperance, presenting it in a more positive and decided manner. We must strive continually to educate the people, not only by our words but by our practice. Precept and practice combined have a telling influence.  {TSDF 115.12}  \n     At the camp-meeting, instruction on health topics should be given to the people. At our meetings in Australia, lectures on health subjects were given daily, and a deep interest was aroused. A tent for the use of physicians and nurses was on the ground, medical advice was given freely, and was sought by many. Thousands of people attended the lectures, \n\n116 \n\nand at the close of the camp-meeting the people were not satisfied to let the matter drop with what they had already learned. In several cities where camp-meetings were held, some of the leading citizens urged that a branch sanitarium be established, promising their co-operation.  {TSDF 115.13}  \n                                                      6 T.--370-371 \n     There is a message regarding health reform to be borne in every church. There is a work to be done in every school. Neither principal nor teachers should be entrusted with the education of the youth until they have a practical knowledge of this subject. Some have felt at liberty to criticize and question and find fault with health-reform principles of which they knew little by experience. They should stand shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, with those who are working in right lines.",
