    "word": "In the dream of Nebuchadnezzar the true object of government is beautifully represented by the great tree \"Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation.\" Now if God had called a man, or any set of men at Battle Creek to rule in any sense, that representation of the tree shows the only kind of ruling acceptable to Him--a government that protects, restores, relieves, \n\n\n                                  -38- \n\nbut never savors of oppression. The poor especially are to be kindly treated. . . . Aid is to be given to the oppressed, and not one soul that bears the image of God is to be placed at the footstool of a human being. The greatest possible kindness and freedom are to be granted to the purchase of the blood of Christ.--Ms 29, 1895, pp. 8, 9. (\"Converted Men Needed in All Departments of the Work.\")",
