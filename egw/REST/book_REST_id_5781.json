    "word": "When we came to Italy, it was with the desire that we might not only learn something of the habits and customs of the people, and the best means of reaching them, but that we might be the means of strengthening and encouraging the brethren and sisters, and that we might also obtain a little much-needed rest. In the latter we were somewhat disappointed, although we did enjoy some features of our stay very much. The climate is healthful, the air clear and bracing. Throughout our stay of three weeks the weather was delightful. Although it was December, most of the time we had the doors open as in summer. Several days we spent some time in riding. This was a great luxury to me, especially as I was suffering much with a lame hip and a broken ankle, and was able to walk but little.",
