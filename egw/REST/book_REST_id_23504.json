    "word": "Had teachers been learning the lessons the Lord would have them learn, there would be a class of students whose bills must be settled by some one, or else they leave the college with a heavy debt hanging over them. Educators are not doing half their work when they know a young man to be devoting years of close application to the study of books, not seeking to earn means to pay his own way, and yet do nothing in the matter. Every case should be investigated; every youth kindly and interestedly inquired after, and his financial situation ascertained. One of the studies put before him as most valuable should be the exercise of his God-given reason in harmony with his physical powers, head, body, hand, and feet. The right use of one's self is the most valuable lesson that can be learned. We are not to do brain work and stop there, or make physical exertions and stop there; but we are to make the very best use of the various parts composing the human machinery, brain, bone and muscle; body, head and heart. No man is fit for the ministry who does not understand how to do this.",
