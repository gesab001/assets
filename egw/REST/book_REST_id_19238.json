Sister Rice \n     and I lay down to rest on blankets and buffaloes. When we awoke, \n     for we slept, our children and Addie and Mary were gone. We looked \n     for them and saw them on the high mountain peaks throwing down \n     stones. They enjoyed climbing the mountain where they had a view of \n     the scenery, the ocean, Golden Gate, and towns and villages. They \n     enjoyed this much. Willie came down the mountains with flowers in \n     his coat that Addie and May had tied in so he looked like one \n     immense bouquet.",
