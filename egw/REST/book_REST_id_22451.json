    "word": "Revelation is a book demanding study. Revelation 1:1, 3. The solemn scenes which Jesus revealed to John are weighty and full of interest to every soul. We should know more of these solemn, weighty testing messages. We should not only know, but with earnest zeal let those with whom we come in contact see and understand that we believe as well as read the prophecy of this book and that they are a revelation to us, a living reality.",
