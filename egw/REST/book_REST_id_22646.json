    "word": "The Lord has signified that the atmosphere surrounding the souls of the students must change. The truths of the word of God demand the most serious attention. This truth is not to be lightly regarded or trifled with. Our duties and privileges are not to be measured by the lightness or frivolity of anyone. The Bible is to be followed as God's word, inspired by heaven. Its revealed facts, which are of the most awful importance to teachers and students, are not to be lightly regarded. Its requirements are not to be tramped upon; for they impose the most weighty obligations. In the rich promises, the consolation of God is presented to those who wear the yoke of restraint and obedience; but those who refuse to wear this yoke will find their course of action bring its own punishment.",
