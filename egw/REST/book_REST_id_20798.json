    "word": "Hygienic restaurants are to be started in our cities. Thus a good work may be done. God will give His people skill and wisdom to make wholesome, palatable foods. He who in the wilderness gave manna to the children of Israel, is our God, ready to give light and knowledge to those whose desire it is to glorify Him. Those in charge of our restaurants should take a firm stand to close them on the Sabbath. Thus they proclaim the Sabbath truth.",
