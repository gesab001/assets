    "word": "O precious Saviour, I long for Thy salvation! \"As the hart panteth after the waterbrooks, so panteth my soul after Thee\" (Psalms 42:1). I long for a clearer view of Jesus. I love to think of His spotless life, to meditate upon His lessons. How many times I repeat the words, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28).",
