    "word": "As Christ presented these truths to minds, He broke up their accustomed train of thought as little as possible. . . . He therefore aroused their minds by presenting truth through the agency of their most familiar associations. He used illustrations in His teaching that called into activity their most hallowed recollections and sympathies, that He might reach the inner temple of the soul. Identifying Himself with their interests, He drew His illustrations from the great book of nature, using objects with which they were familiar. The lily of the field, the seed sown by the sower, the springing up of the seed, and the harvesting of the grain, the birds of the air\u2014all these figures He used to present divine truth, for these would remind them of His lessons whenever they should afterward look upon them. . . .",
