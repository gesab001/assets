    "word": "If the youth could only see how much good it is their power to accomplish, if they would make God their strength and wisdom, they would no longer pursue a course of careless indifference toward God; they would be no longer swayed by the influence of those who are unconsecrated. Instead of feeling that an individual responsibility rests upon them, to put forth efforts to do others good, and lead them to righteousness and holiness, they give themselves up to their own amusement. They are useless members of society, and their lives are aimless as the butterfly's.",
