    "word": "Notwithstanding the small value of the inhabitants of this world in comparison with all the rest of the universe, Christ volunteered to take upon Himself the nature of humanity, and to bear on His own divine soul all the sins of mankind, in order that He might redeem the fallen race and enable them to gain life eternal. In view of His infinite sacrifice, how cruel it is for men and women to refuse to accept the great salvation offered them, or to misrepresent their Saviour after professing to give themselves wholly to His service! How cruel of them to doubt that He will hear their prayers! He says, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\"",
