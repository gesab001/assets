    "word": "Obedience Produces Rest.--There will be peace, constant peace, flowing into the soul, for the rest is found in perfect submission to Jesus Christ. Obedience to God's will finds the rest. The disciple that treads in the meek and lowly steps of the Redeemer finds rest which the world cannot give and the world cannot take away. \"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee: because he trusteth in Thee\" (Isaiah 26:3).--Lt 6, 1893. (HC 98.)",
