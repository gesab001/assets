    "word": "Successful energy and rashness are two different elements. The former is power while the latter, unrestrained and uncontrolled, leads to destruction. Calm, unhurried efforts will do more than rash, hurried movements. Do not confound rashness with energy. Your energy is too much controlled by impulse. It is spasmodic, affected by circumstances and surroundings.",
