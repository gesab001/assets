    "word": "The interest here is broadening and deepening. The men in government employ who are interested are afraid to come out and say to the authorities, I will keep the Sabbath; but two have taken their stand, and they are both enjoying the blessing of the Lord. One, Brother Sharp, lost his position and was out of work for one week only. He was then employed by another firm at the same wages he had been receiving, and was much more comfortably situated. The other, Brother Stuckey, was baptized. He then told his employer that he could not work on the Sabbath, and the Sabbath was given him. Others who have good positions are interested, but the cross seems heavy. Those who have taken their stand are sharp, intelligent business men, and if all their talents are cultivated they will be a great blessing to the church. . . .",
