    "word": "The master of the house unharnessed our horse and put him in the stall and fed him with grain. He was well acquainted with Oscar Roth, and he told him that he did not want anything more to do with him since he published such things as he did about the Catholics in the French Signs. He said he was greatly offended, and Oscar told him that neither he nor his sister Mary, who \n\n\n                                    -28- \n\nwas with us, was responsible for these pieces being put in the Signs. He smoothed down after a time and said, \"Well, we will talk no more about it. We will talk of something else.\" We look upon this as being an interesting little bit of experience.--Ms 64, 1886, pp. 5, 6.
