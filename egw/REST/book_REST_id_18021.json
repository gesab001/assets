    "word": "If you are allured to unite your life-interest with an young, inexperienced girl, who is really deficient in an education in the common, practical, daily duties of life, you make a mistake; but this is small in comparison with her ignorance in regard to her duty to God. She has not been destitute of light. She has had religious privileges, and yet her heart has not felt her wretched sinfulness without Christ. If you, in your infatuation, can turn from the prayer-meeting, repeatedly, where God meets with his people, in order to enjoy the society of one who has no love for God, and sees no attractions in the religious life, how do you expect God can prosper such a union?

The habit of sitting up late at night is customary, but it is not pleasing to God, even if you were both Christians. These untimely hours injure health, unfit the mind for the next day's duties, and have an appearance of evil. My brother, I hope you will have self-respect enough to shun this form of courtship. If you have an eye single to the glory of God, you will move with deliberate caution. You will not suffer love-sick sentimentalism to so blind your vision that you cannot discern the high claims your God has upon you as a Christian.",
