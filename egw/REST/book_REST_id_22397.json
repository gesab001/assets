    "word": "If you knew the circumstances of this brother, and did not make earnest efforts to relieve him, and change his oppression to freedom, you are not working the works of Christ, and are guilty before God. I write plainly, for, from the light given me of God, there is a class of work that is neglected. There may be great interest taken in the wholesale business of feeding the wretched class who are in poverty; all this I have no objection to, but it is a misdirected zeal if we pass by the cases of those who are of the household of faith, and let their cry of distress come up to God because of suffering which we might alleviate and in thus doing represent Jesus Christ in sympathy and love, the Lord has a controversy with us for this neglect. He cannot say to any man or woman, \"Well done,\" unless they have done well in representing the attributes of Christ, goodness, compassion, and love, to their fellowmen.",
