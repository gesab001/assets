    "word": "God set the seventh day apart as the day of his rest. But the man of sin has set up a false sabbath, which the kings and merchants of the earth have accepted and exalted above the Sabbath of the Bible. In doing this they have chosen a religion like that of Cain, who slew his brother Abel. Cain and Abel \n                                                                           148\nboth offered sacrifice to God. Abel's offering was accepted because he complied with God's requirements. Cain's was rejected because he followed his own human inventions. Because of this he became so angry that he would not listen to Abel's entreaties or to God's warnings and reproofs, but slew his brother.",
