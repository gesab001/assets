I saw the great work to be done\u2014the work that ought to have been done years ago. We seemed to be looking at many places. Our first interest was for the places where the work has already been established, and for the places where the way has opened for a beginning to be made. I saw the places in the South where institutions have been established for the advancement of the Lord\u2019s work. One of the places that I saw was Graysville, and another [was] Huntsville. The Lord led in the establishment of these schools.",
