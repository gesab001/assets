    "word": "The work of God is worthy of our best efforts. In fulfillment of the divine plan, the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost. He taught the erring and sinful ones whom He came to save, and wrestled in earnest prayer to His Father in their behalf; and we should engage in the same work. If it was not beneath the dignity of the Son of God, the Creator of worlds, should it be considered too humiliating or too self-sacrificing for His followers?  No, indeed. However aspiring we may be, there is no calling that is higher, holier, and more ennobling\n19\nthan to be a colaborer with the Son of God.",
