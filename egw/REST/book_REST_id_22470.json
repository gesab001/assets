    "word": "God reads the motives that underlies the work of which I have spoken. These motives have been revealed to me, and I feel a depth of sorrow that is beyond expansion. I cannot vindicate motives or methods, because they are an offense to God. I must take my stand fully. But what need for me to say more? I have written over and over again, but what has been the effort of the testimonies? What reformations have they wrought? What restitutions have been made? Men who have not the love of God in their hearts will prove to be only fallible erring mortals. \"Without me,\" says Christ, \"ye can do nothing.\" Every soul connected with the work needs to be daily converted.",
