    "word": "My brother, I cannot understand how you could tell me that there is in the Living Temple nothing that is not in harmony with what we as a people believe.

The rebuke of God is upon every minister and every medical missionary leader who has been asleep on the walls of Zion, when as vigilant watchmen they should have warned the people of the Lord against the dangers threatening them. \n\n\n                                    -358-",
