    "word": "The churches in different localities should feel that a solemn responsibility rests upon them to train youth and educate talent to engage in missionary efforts. When they see any in the church who give promise of making useful workers, but who are not able to educate themselves, they should lift that responsibility and send them to College to be instructed, and developed, with the object in view of becoming workers in the cause of God. There is material that needs to be worked up, and that would be of good service in the Lord's vineyard, but they are too poor to obtain the advantages of the College. The church should feel it a privilege to take the responsibility of defraying their expenses.",
