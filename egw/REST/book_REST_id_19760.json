    "word": "Camp meetings are not to be made business meetings, so that the public will lose the precious opportunity of hearing the words of truth. Let short, pointed discourses be given, and after a discourse has been given, ask those who wish to follow Christ to signify it. Then take them into a tent by themselves and pray with and for them. Hold fast to those who are interested, until they are confirmed in the faith. There are too few revival efforts made.--Letter 28, 1900, p. 12 (Feb. 17, 1900).",
