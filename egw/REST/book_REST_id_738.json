    "word": "All heaven is interested in the work of those who are to be saved in the kingdom of God. \u201cWithout me,\u201d says Christ, \u201cye can do nothing.\u201d Therefore there is not one iota of glory that we can take to ourselves. Notwithstanding you may feel your weakness, yet you may link yourself to the mighty God. I know that I am nothing, but Jesus is mighty to save. I can do nothing, but Jesus can do great things. God wants me in the work, but my efforts will be useless without His help.",
