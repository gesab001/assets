    "word": "I intended to write you from Battle Creek, but this was not possible, for I was very sick--sores gathering and breaking in my head. I have discharged much blood from my head, for my brain has been congested and fevered.

I soon fainted, but the Lord mercifully restored me so that when we arrived at Jackson I could, with your father's assistance, walk from the cars through a dense crowd to the depot.",
