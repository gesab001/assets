    "word": "We had an interview with a Swedish sister who can speak English. She spent two years in Chicago. She was keeping the Sabbath when she went there. The family she worked for was kind to her and permitted her to keep the Sabbath. She says she had a place when she first went to Chicago where there \n\n\n                                     -388- \n\nwas but little work but the mistress for whom she worked scolded her for everything and she was sad all the time. Her mistress was not willing she should leave her but she felt so full of sorrow she could not stay. She found a place where the work was much harder but everything was pleasant. Her heart was light all the time, because she was not fretted at and scolded. This seems to be a woman of good judgment. She came back from America with the purpose of taking care of her father; but if the work had not been as hard she would have remained longer. The dresses to wash and the ruffles and white shirts to do up in warm weather, with all the rest of the work for a family of seven, was hard for her.",
