    "word": "If sinners repent, their pardon is procured through the merits of Christ. Then work interestedly, trying to lead souls to repentance. This will be your everlasting rejoicing. All who see this matter in its true bearing will more fully comprehend the wondrous, glorious plan of salvation. There will be no desire to argue over just what is meant by Christ being our righteousness, or to try to explain some questions which do not in any way make more plain the terms of salvation. It is not so essential to understand the precise particulars in regard to the relation of the two laws. It is of far greater consequence that we know whether we are transgressing the law of God, whether we stand in obedience or disobedience before the holy precepts.",
