    "word": "Train for Missionary Service.--Our institutions should be missionary agencies in the highest sense, and true missionary work always begins with those nearest. In every institution there is missionary work to be done. From the manager to the humblest worker, all should feel a responsibility for the unconverted among their own number. They should put forth earnest effort to bring them \n\n52 \n\nto Christ. As the result of such effort many will be won and will become faithful and true in service to God.",
