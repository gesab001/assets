    "word": "The bad influence around our children is almost overpowering; corrupting their minds and leading them down to perdition. The minds of youth are naturally given to folly, and at an early age, before their characters are formed, and their judgment matured, they frequently manifest preference for associates who will have an injurious influence over them. Some form attachments for the other sex, and disregard the wishes and entreaties of their parents, and break the fifth commandment, by thus dishonoring them. It is the duty of parents to watch the going out and coming in of their children. They should encourage them, and present inducements before them which will attract them at home, and lead them to see that their parents are interested for them. They should make home pleasant and cheerful. Speak kindly to your children. Fathers and mothers, remember how sensitive you are, how little you can bear to be blamed. Reflect, and know that your children are like you. That which you cannot bear, don't lay upon your children. If you cannot bear censure and blame, neither can your children who are weaker than you, and cannot endure as much. Let your pleasant, cheerful words ever be like sunbeams in your family. The fruits of self-control, thoughtfulness, and pains-taking on your part, will be an hundred-fold.",
