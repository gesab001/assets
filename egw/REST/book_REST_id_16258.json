Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). What kind of vessels are meet for the Master's use?--Empty vessels. When we empty the soul of every defilement, we are ready for use.",
