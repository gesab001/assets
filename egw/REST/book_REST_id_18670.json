    "word": "There is a morning meeting. About sixty were present. Brother Olsen preached in forenoon to well-filled tent. Brother Ings gave a Bible reading. He had a large attendance. At five o'clock I spoke to a tent crowded full. Every seat was occupied and a wall of people was about the tent. All were orderly and listened with apparent interest. Many found seats on the platform. Many were standing under the tent and around the tent. I had freedom in speaking to the people from Titus 2:11-14. Elder Matteson interpreted for me. I think I have not seen as an average a more intelligent, noble-looking company than was before me, both men and women.",
