    "word": "Letter 349, 1904. (To Mrs. Marian Stowell Crawford, December 29, 1904, from St. Helena, Calif.) We are home again, and I am much pleased to be once more in my quiet retreat. For many months I have had no time to get rested. During the last year we have spent only five months in our pleasant home. Since last April I have been traveling constantly, and have spoken in public in a great many places. I have at times been greatly wearied, but when standing before the people I have realized the keeping power of God. When I opened my lips to speak, the Holy Spirit would come upon me, and the Lord strengthened me as His witness. \n\n\n                                    -250-",
