    "word": "Many who profess to love Jesus Christ do not show proper reverence and respect for Him who gave His life to save them from eternal death. He is not reverenced or respected or recognized. This is shown by the injury done to their own bodies in violation to the laws of their being. Whoever in any way disregards the laws of their being, will suffer the sure consequence of their own course of action. And in their pain and suffering, they will under the suggestions of Satan, find fault with God for causing them to be afflicted. Should the Lord work a miracle to restore the wonderful fine machinery which human beings (have damaged) through their own carelessness and inattention, and their indulgence of appetite and passions, in doing the very things that the Lord has told them that they should not do? Should He do so, the Lord would be administering to sin, which is the transgression of His own law. \n\n\n                                   - 47 - \n\nThe moral sense of the human agent in our world is exceedingly low upon the subject of their own bodies and their own lives. But the Lord has placed before the human family the right way in His word. Will they keep the way of the Lord?",
