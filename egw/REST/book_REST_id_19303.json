    "word": "June 21: Another night of restlessness and suffering has passed. I welcome the coming of five o'clock in the morning; for then Emily Campbell builds my fire, and I can be dressed. I will not allow my mind to dwell on the dark side. Jesus has light and comfort and hope and joy for me. I want to face the light, that the brightness of the Sun of Righteousness may shine \n\n\n                                    -47- \n\ninto my heart, and be reflected to others. It is the duty of every Christian to shine,--to shed abroad the light of the grace that Christ imparts. God would have me, even in my pain, praise him, showing that I realize that His presence is with me. [Romans 5:1; 1 John 5:11, quoted]. . . .",
