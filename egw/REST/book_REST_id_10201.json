    "word": "A Vision of Our Work.--The souls of those whom we desire to save are like the representation which Ezekiel saw in vision,--a valley of dry bones. They are dead in trespasses and sins, but God would have us deal with them as though they were living. Were the question put to us, \"Son of man, can these bones live?\" our answer would be only the confession of ignorance, \"O Lord, Thou knowest.\" To all appearance there is nothing to lead us to hope for their restoration. Yet nevertheless the word of the prophecy must be spoken even to those who are like the dry bones in the valley. We are in no wise to be deterred from fulfilling our commission by the listlessness, the dullness, the lack of spiritual perception, in those upon whom the Word of God is brought to bear. We are to preach the word of life to those whom we may judge to be as hopeless subjects as though they were in their graves.",
