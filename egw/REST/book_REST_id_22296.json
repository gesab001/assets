    "word": "The opening exercises were this morning. I endured my long ride well. I was carried up stairs in a chair by two men; after resting a while on the bed I was taken again down in the chair into the room appropriated for a chapel, where the opening exercises of the school were held. Elder Tenny spoke appropriate words, about forty minutes, and then I was called upon to speak. I was willing and gladly expressed my feelings in reference to the establishment of a school in Australia, and I had special freedom in speaking. Then Willie spoke well for about half an hour. His words were well chosen. Elder Starr then made good remarks. Then Elder Rousseau spoke well. Everything passed off very nicely, and all seemed pleased. \n                                                                           997",
