    "word": "This drive, after my labor on Sabbath and Sunday, was too much for me. When I reached the sanitarium, I was taken to the bathroom in a wheel chair, and took thorough treatment. But I could not sleep that night, and have not had a good night's rest since. I am quite lame, and suffer considerably from hip, kidneys, and spine. I am taking good treatments, but the pain and lameness in the hip continue.",
