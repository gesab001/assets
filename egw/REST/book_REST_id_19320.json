    "word": "I have had a restless night. I have passed through the process of having my teeth extracted during my dreams. Sister Caro came in the night; is in the house. I met her in the morning at the breakfast table. She said, \"Are you sorry to see me?\" I answered, \"I am pleased to meet Sister Caro, certainly. [I am] not so certain whether I am pleased to meet Mrs. Dr. Caro, dentist.\" At ten o'clock I was in the chair and in a short time eight teeth were drawn. I was glad when the job was over. I did not wince or groan. My hand was held as steadily as if I had been writing and a nerve was set in motion by the operation. I had asked the Lord to strengthen me and give me grace to endure the painful process, and I know the Lord heard my prayer.",
