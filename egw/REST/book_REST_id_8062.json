    "word": "Jesus calls us to Himself not simply to refresh us with His grace and presence for a few hours, and then to send us forth from His light to walk apart from Him in sadness and gloom. No, no. He tells us that we must abide with Him and He with us. Wherever His work is to be done He is present\u2014tender, loving, and compassionate. He has prepared for you and me an abiding dwelling place in Himself. He is our refuge. Our experience should broaden and deepen. Jesus has opened up all the divine fullness of His inexpressible love, and He declares to you, Ye \u201care labourers together with God\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:9). O what meaning these words have\u2014\u201dAbide in me\u201d (John 15:4), \u201cTake my yoke upon you\u201d (Matthew 11:29). Will we take it? for the promise is, \u201cYe shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d There is rest, complete rest in abiding in Christ.",
