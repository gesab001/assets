    "word": "God calls for missionaries. There are talent and ability in the church at Olcott that will grow in capacity and power as they are exercised in the work and cause of God. If these brethren will educate their minds in making the cause of God their first interest, and will sacrifice their pleasure and inclination for the truth's sake, the blessing of God will rest upon them. These brethren, who love the truth, and have been for years rejoicing because of increasing light shining upon the Scriptures, should let their light shine forth to those who are in darkness. God will be to them wisdom and power, and will glorify himself in working with and by those who wholly follow him. \"If any man will serve me, him will my Father honor.\" The wisdom and power of God will be given to the willing and faithful. \n                                                                           77",
