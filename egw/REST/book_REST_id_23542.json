    "word": "The debt for the additional building has been hanging over the school as a discouragement, and thus it will ever be until there shall be a deeper consecration and self-sacrifice all through our churches.

Sacrifice was the very beginning of our work in advancing the truth and in establishing institutions. Sacrifice must become habitual in all our building in this life, if we would have a building of God not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.",
