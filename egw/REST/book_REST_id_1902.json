Teach the people that they can act as God's helping hand, by cooperating with the Master Worker in restoring physical and spiritual health. This work bears the signature of heaven, and will open doors for the entrance of other precious truths. There is room for all to labor who will take hold of this work intelligently. \n     [SEE MEDICAL MINISTRY, SECTION 2, \"THE DIVINE PLAN IN THE MEDICAL MISSIONARY WORK,\" AND SECTION 13, \"MEDICAL MISSIONARY WORK AND THE GOSPEL MINISTRY\"]",
