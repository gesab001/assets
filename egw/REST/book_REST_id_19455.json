    "word": "Your children need a father's care. Teach them habits of industry. Be not too careful to shield them from hardship. Teach them the power of endurance. Teach them as much as possible to be useful, especially your eldest son. If you cannot be with him to instruct him to useful employment, which will prevent evil habits from taking root, it would be wise to have a judicious person take charge of him who could love him and yet teach him industry, light labor or [that] which will not tax the constitution. Such a course would be for the interest of your child.",
