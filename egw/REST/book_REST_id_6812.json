    "word": "The presidents of our conferences and others in responsible positions have a duty to do in this matter, that the different branches of our work may receive attention. Canvassers are to be educated and trained to do the work required in selling the books upon present truth which the people need. There is need of men of deep \n67\nChristian experience, men of well-balanced minds, strong, well-educated men, to engage in this work. The Lord desires those to take hold of the canvassing work who are capable of educating others, who can awaken in promising young men and women an interest in this line, leading them to take up the book-work and handle it successfully. Some have the talent, education, experience which would enable them to educate the youth for the canvassing work in such a way that much more would be accomplished than is now being done.",
