    "word": "The heavenly messenger continued: \"I have come to warn you. You seem to be dazed. Before you can do a work acceptable to the Lord, you must first break this spell that is upon you. God would have you link up with your brethren. He would not have you defend Dr. Kellogg in the falsehoods that he is now presenting, and thus help to fasten him securely in Satan's snare; for God will send his judgments upon all who walk in the light of Satanic theories, the evil results of which are far-reaching. You now see only the beginning, but the influences exerted will continue to widen and deepen until the Lord shall by His judgments arrest the men who are deceived and deluded, and who, by false representations and deceptive statements are rapidly bringing in misunderstandings, strife, and dissension.",
