    "word": "We need, individually, to take heed as we have never done before to a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" There are men who are disloyal to God, who transgress His holy Sabbath, who cavil over the plainest statements of the Word, who misinterpret and wrest the Scriptures from their true meaning, and who at the same time make desperate efforts to harmonize their disobedience with the Scriptures. But the Word condemns such practice, as it condemned the scribes and Pharisees in Christ's day. We need to know what is truth. Shall we do as did the Pharisees? Shall we turn from the greatest Teacher that the world has ever known to the traditions and maxims and sayings of men? Shall we not rather make a change in this matter? This is what the Jews should have done, but did not do. . . .",
