His seed should prolong their days on the earth forever. \"Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy \n                                                                           178\ndays may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\" By his obedience to his father and mother, Christ was an example to all children and youth; but today children are not following the example he has given, and the sure result will be a shortening of their days.",
