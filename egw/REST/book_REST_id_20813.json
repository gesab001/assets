    "word": "Let God place restrictions on His workers, but let man beware how he places restrictions where God places none. If men are permitted to control the \n\n\n                                  -226- \n\njudgment of their fellow men, oppression will result. The cause of God will be bound about. Scheme after scheme that is unjust will be planned. Let not men take on themselves the responsibility of controlling the words and actions of their fellow men. Let our institutions give place to the working of God on human minds. Let God have opportunity to control. Should the principle obtain sway that in speaking and writing, men are to be under the control of human beings, deadly evils would be the result.",
