    "word": "We need a genuine education in the art of cooking. Instead of multiplying our restaurants, it will be better to form classes, where you may teach the people how to make good bread, and how to put together the ingredients to make healthful food combinations from the grains and the vegetables. Such an education will assist in creating a desire among our people to move out of the cities, to secure land in the country, where they can raise their own fruit and vegetables. Then they can care for their gardens, and their food will not come to them half spoiled and decayed.",
