    "word": "In many new fields there should be camp-meetings of two, three, or four weeks in a place, if the circumstances demand it. And all through these meetings there is to be much personal effort, not only in the exposition of the word in the meetings, but by individuals. Follow up every advantage in the very height of the surprise of the people to find out that there are important, wonderful things in the word that they have not known were there at all, because the shepherds of the flock have not searched the Scriptures as diligent students of the Word. There is to be diligent work done. The testing truth for this time is to be made known, and the explanation given. All classes, the higher as well as the most lowly, come to these meetings, and we are to work for all. After the warning message has been given, let those who are specially interested be called to the tent by themselves, and there labor for their conversion. This kind of labor is missionary work of the highest order.",
