    "word": "The teachers of the Word need on bended knees to seek for an understanding of the Scriptures. The workers in the Lord's vineyard need to draw continually from the Scriptures, not from the chambers of their imagination, sowing chaff among the wheat and making the chaff of more importance than the wheat, that they may secure glory for themselves. It is time that the men and women who have the Word of God in their hands rested not until the Holy Spirit gives them an understanding of the Word and works a reformation in their hearts. Then the movers in the proclamation of the last message of mercy for a fallen world will show that they are controlled by the Holy Spirit. \n                                                                           1721",
