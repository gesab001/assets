    "word": "Chap. 4 - The Conflicting Principles of Christ and Satan\n\n     Human beings belong to one great family,--the family of God. The Creator designed that they should respect and love one another, ever manifesting a pure, unselfish interest in one another's welfare. But Satan's aim has been to lead men to self first; and yielding themselves to his control, they have developed a selfishness that has filled the world with misery and strife, setting human beings at variance with one another.",
