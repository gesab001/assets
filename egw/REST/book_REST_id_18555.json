    "word": "These souls who have decided to walk in the light will have need of great watchfulness and most earnest prayer. As soon as Satan sees one soul breaking away from his deceptive lies and coming to the light of truth, he is actively at work to place every conceivable obstacle in his path. Let a man or woman become interested in the truth and show respect and obedience to the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, let him in good earnest set about the work of repentance and the saving of his soul, and he will assuredly draw upon himself the disfavor and opposition of the circle of his worldly acquaintances. If he is a member of any of the churches, the determined, active opposition of the church members will be set in operation. Every soul \n\n\n                                     -118- \n\nwho has come to the point to accept advanced truth has realized this in every age of the world.",
