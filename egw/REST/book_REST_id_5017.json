    "word": "\u201cWhile the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and  slept.\u201d By the tarrying of the bridegroom is represented the passing of the time when the Lord was expected, the disappointment, and the seeming delay. In this time of uncertainty, the interest of the superficial and half-hearted soon began to waver, and their efforts to relax; but those whose faith was based on a personal knowledge of the Bible had a rock beneath their feet, which the waves of disappointment could not wash away. \u201cThey all slumbered and slept;\u201d one class in unconcern and abandonment of their faith, the other class patiently waiting till clearer light should be given. Yet in the night of trial the latter seemed to lose, to some extent, their zeal and devotion. The  half-hearted and superficial could no longer lean upon the  faith of their brethren. Each must stand or fall for himself.",
