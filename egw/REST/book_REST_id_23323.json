    "word": "While we should ever be ready to follow the opening providence of God, we should lay no larger plans, nor occupy more ground than there is help and means to bind off the work well, keep up and increase the interest already started. While there are broader plans and fields constantly opening for the laborers, our ideas and views must broaden in regard to the workers who are to labor to bring souls to the truth. Our young ministers must be encouraged to take hold of the work with energy, and labor in educating, as well as encouragement must be given to these men. They must be trained and disciplined to carry forward the work in simplicity.  I am astonished to see how little some of our young ministers are appreciated, and how little encouragement they receive. Yet some of them cling to the work and do anything and everything with unselfish interest; but some will yet be lost to the cause because they are not receiving proper encouragement.",
