In believing them there is rest and peace. \"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" Our prayers will reach the ear of Christ, and He will open unto us the rich treasures of His grace. Through prayer we are brought into communion with the high and holy One who inhabiteth eternity. He opens the door to every one who will knock. \n                                                                -\n \n                                                                           35",
