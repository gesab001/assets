    "word": "\"Standing by a purpose true,\" should be the position of all connected with this institution. While none should urge our faith upon the patients, or engage in religious controversy with them, our papers and publication, carefully selected, should be in sight almost everywhere. The religious element must predominate. This has been and ever will be the power of that institution. But it is now taking the mold of fashion. Physicians and all others in influential positions are making a mistake, in their inventions to retain patients and to secure the popular favor. Here is where every other institution \n                                                                           84\nnow in existence has failed. God never designed that our health asylum should be of this stamp. There are hygienic institutions enough in our land that are more like an accommodating hotel than an asylum where the sick and suffering can obtain relief for their bodily infirmities, and the sin-sick soul can find that peace and rest in Jesus to be found nowhere else. When religious principles are made prominent, and kept so; when pride and popularity are discarded; when simplicity and plainness, kindness and faithfulness are seen everywhere,--then the Sanitarium will be just what God designed it should be; then the Lord will favor it. \n\n                                               -",
