    "word": "It is an offense to God that his work should be restricted by human beings. The word of the living God, appealing to sanctified reason, will never give to the work such an impress as is now revealed. There has been deceit, falsehood, artifice, selfishness. Schemes have been set on foot to rob God and to rob man, in order to make up to the work for what selfish devices have abstracted. The very position you have taken with these men in concocting plans to relieve the financial embarrassment, has made you in some respects a weak man. It has warped your judgment. You have been led to subvert justice, to depart from honesty in business dealing with your brethren. A wrong against the weakest or most erring of his flock is even more offensive to God than if it were against the strongest one among you. Souls are the Lords \n                                                                           1527\npurchased possession, and every injustice done \"unto the least of these my brethren\" said Jesus, is done \"unto me.\" The Lord will not suffer injustice or oppression to go unreproved.",
