    "word": "Guarding Against Licentiousness. It is the spirit of the age to despise restraint, to desire to follow inclination, to jest and joke and be jolly in amusement with young ladies; and the result has been wrecks of character, encouragement to impurity, licentiousness, immorality, and marriages which have ruined the usefulness and efficiency of men and women who had ability and talents but who have been unable to rise to any noble heights after their unwise marriages. Thus the wheels of progress have been blocked, the powers of the mind dwarfed.",
