    "word": "Judas was tempted and tried, but not rising above his temptations and trials, he lost ground, and finally went so far as to betray his Lord. Christ permitted him to go with the other disciples on their evangelistic tours, but he often manifested a spirit of superiority. He sought to exercise authority over his brethren. This spirit, unchecked and unrestrained, opened the way for the enemy to work upon his mind and heart, until at length he went so far as to betray his Lord and Saviour with a treacherous kiss.",
