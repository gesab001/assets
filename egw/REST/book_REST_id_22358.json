    "word": "Every Christian physician has a cure for souls, whether he desires to have it or not. He can be a great blessing and an imitator of the Lord Jesus. But the temptations that come to a physician are great, for he is often pressed beyond measure, over-worked, over-worried. But if he will commit the keeping of his soul to God as unto a faithful Creator, he will find rest and peace. A soothing influence from Jesus will come to him.",
