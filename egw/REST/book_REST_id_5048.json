    "word": "\u201cHe that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.\u201d [Proverbs 28:13.] If those who hide and excuse their faults could see how Satan exults over them, how he taunts Christ and holy angels with their course, they would make haste to confess their sins and to put them away. Through defects in the character, Satan works to gain control of the whole mind, and he knows that if these defects are cherished, he will succeed. Therefore he is constantly seeking to deceive the followers of Christ with his fatal sophistry that it is impossible for them to overcome. But Jesus pleads in their behalf his wounded hands, his bruised body; and he declares to all who would follow him, \u201cMy grace is sufficient for thee.\u201d [2 Corinthians 12:9.] \u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, \n490\nand my burden is light.\u201d [Matthew 11:29, 30.] Let none, then, regard their defects as incurable. God will give faith and grace to overcome them.",
