    "word": "He who devotes himself to arduous public labor in the cause of humanity, often finds little time to devote to his own family, and, in one sense, is left almost without a family and without fireside, social influences. It has been thus with Bro. Bell. His mind has been constantly taxed. He had little opportunity to win the affections of his children, or to give them needed restraint and guidance. They were nervous and willful. A firm, discreet, loving mother, could have controlled these unsubmissive children, and Bro. Bell might have had a far happier home.",
