    "word": "From what has been shown me, there should be a careful selection of help in that Office. The young, and untried, and unconsecrated, should not be placed there; for they are exposed to temptations, and have not fixed characters. Those who have formed characters, and have fixed principles, and the truth of God in the heart, will not be a constant source of anxiety and care, but rather helps and blessings. There are those in B. C. who should be in a place where they will have a spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion to the interest and success of the truth, to take care of those in the Office, in finding homes for them. And the Office of publication is amply able to make arrangements to secure good helpers, who have ability and principle. \n                                                                           28\nAnd the church in their turn should not seek to advantage themselves one penny from those who come to the Office to labor and learn their trade. There are positions where some can earn more wages than those at the Office, but they can never find a position more important, more honorable, or exalted, than the work of God in the Office. Those who labor faithfully and unselfishly will be rewarded. For them there is a crown of glory prepared, compared with which, all earthly honors and pleasures are as the small dust of the balance. Especially will those be blessed who have been faithful to God in watching over the spiritual welfare of others in the Office. Pecuniary and temporal interests, in comparison with this, sinks into insignificance. In one scale is gold dust, in the other a human soul and such value that honor, riches, and glory, have been sacrificed by the Son of God to ransom it from the bondage of sin and hopeless despair. The soul is of infinite value, and demands the most attention. Every man who fears God in that Office should put away childish and vain things, and stand erect, with true moral courage, in the dignity of his manhood, shunning low familiarity, yet binding heart to heart in the bond of Christian interest and love. Hearts yearn for sympathy and love, and are as much refreshed \n                                                                           29\nand strengthened by them as flowers are by showers and sunshine.",
