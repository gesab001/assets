    "word": "Washington, D.C., Friday morning, December 26, 1890 \n\n     I have had a very precious blessing all night. I slept some but my heart was full of praise and thanksgiving to God. Jesus was precious to my soul and the love of God was so great I wished to dwell upon it and be comforted, and the peace of Christ rested upon me in large measure. Oh, how precious was my contemplation, as I reviewed the precious promises hung in memory's hall. I was assured that nothing was wanting in the gracious provisions made for our encouragement.",
