    "word": "The managers of the Review and Herald could not be ignorant of my financial situation, but what interest have they shown to change this order of things? I thank them for permitting me to draw money to carry on the work. But their course in regard to the circulation of my books has made it a necessity for me to speak. I cannot be clear and keep silent. I cannot have confidence to leave these matters, which to me involves so much, to their discretionary power, when I am brought into constant embarrassment. I have less confidence in their management than I have had, for I cannot believe that the Lord leads them to pursue the course they have taken.",
