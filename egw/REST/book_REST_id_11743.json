    "word": "Some parents have failed to give their children a religious education, and have also neglected their school education. Neither should have been neglected. Children's minds will be active. If not engaged in physical labor, or occupied with study, they will be exposed to bad influences. It is sin for parents to suffer their children to grow up in ignorance. They should be supplied with useful and interesting books. They should be learned to work, and have hours for physical labor, and hours to devote to study and reading.",
