To the Leading Men in the Southern California Conference: \n\nDear Brethren: \n     God's messengers are to sense their grave responsibility. They are to trust humbly in God. The Lord calls now for conscientious, humble minute-men. He invites them, \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" The Lord Jesus came to our world as its Redeemer. He came as an example to all men. The world was in need of a correct representation of the future inhabitants of the city of God.",
