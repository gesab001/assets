    "word": "The Country And The People\n     Christiania presents but little of special interest to the traveler. It is pleasantly situated at the foot of gently sloping, grassy and pine-clad hills, the picturesque fiord stretching away in the distance, enlivened with occasional steamboats and sailing vessels. For the most part, the dwellings, as well as the customs of the people, are very plain and simple.",
