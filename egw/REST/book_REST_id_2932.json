    "word": "God in His great mercy has brought the truth to your knowledge. You love the truth. You see its claims upon you. It has wrought\n209\na reformation in the life and has led you to have a deep interest in the spiritual welfare of your children. All this is in accordance with the Spirit of God. But while you feel thus anxious you fail seriously to do the work the Lord has left you as parents to do. Your children have not been restrained. They have been indulged to their injury. They have not been brought into subjection as God requires.",
