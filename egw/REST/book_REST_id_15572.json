    "word": "\u201cThe land shall not be sold for ever\u201d was the Lord\u2019s direction: \u201cfor the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold. And if the man . . . himself be able to redeem it; . . . he may return unto his possession. But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee\u201d (Leviticus 25:23-28). . . . Thus every family was secured in its possession, and a safeguard was afforded against the extremes of either wealth or want.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, pp. 183-185.",
