    "word": "I have a caution for my brethren who are working in the Southern field. Do not move hastily in establishing interests in new places, in a way that will divide your workers and your means, so that your force will be weakened. Wait until some of the interests that have been started more nearly approach perfection. Do not rush into new enterprises until the work that has already been started in Graysville and Huntsville is better established, and the interests in Nashville are strengthened. The reasons for strengthening the work in Nashville have been presented to you quite fully.",
