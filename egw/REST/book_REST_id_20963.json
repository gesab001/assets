    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 13, 1892. Last night I rested better. May Walling, my adopted daughter, kept up a good fire all day, and I felt no chill. In the morning I wrote on the life of Christ, and in the afternoon I rode out. I am sure that my work is not yet done. I feel great comfort in the thought that the Lord has a watchcare over me.
