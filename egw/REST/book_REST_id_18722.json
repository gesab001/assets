    "word": "The great Teacher who came down from heaven has not directed you to any of the supposed great authors. He says, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" Christ has promised to give you rest, and in learning your lessons of Him, you will find rest.",
