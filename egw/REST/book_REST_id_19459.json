    "word": "MR No. 652 - The Inspiration of Ellen White\n\n     Physically, I have always been as a broken vessel; and yet in my old age the Lord continues to move upon me by His Holy Spirit to write the most important books that have ever come before the churches and the world. The Lord is evidencing what He can do through weak vessels. The life that He spares I will use to His glory. And, when He may see fit to let me rest, His messages shall be of even more vital force than when the frail instrumentality through whom they were delivered, was living.--Ms 122, 1903. (\"The Time of the End,\" October 9, 1903).",
