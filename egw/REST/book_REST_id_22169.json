    "word": "I will ask no pay of the conference for the remainder of the year, for I am not in a fit condition to travel and labor. I fear without special direction from the Lord bidding me to go and bear my testimony I shall be presumptuous. I know that Jesus is my Restorer, but [I shall be presumptuous] if I do as I have done, carrying the burdens I have carried without change or rest, and going wherever invited because I fear I should show want of faith if I do not go. Thus I have worked ever since I stepped from the steamer upon American soil, and Satan had worked up matters so that my burdens and labors would be fifty-fold greater than there was any need of these being. Brother Butler has been at the foundation of it all, but he makes no confession and writes in the papers as though he were all right.",
