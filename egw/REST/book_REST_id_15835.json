    "word": "We are ever to be learners of Christ. He has invited us, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and [in your own experience, as you partake of My spirit and principles] ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:28, 29). Christ's yoke is a yoke of submission and obedience. . . .",
