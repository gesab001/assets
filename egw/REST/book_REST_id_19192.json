    "word": "Be of good courage, my sister. The Lord is your helper. You ask me in reference to the publication of books on certain subjects of moral purity. I cannot now take time to write you as I would be pleased to, for the mail must leave this morning. I have had an experience in these lines that I would be pleased to write to you of, but I cannot do this today. In the talks you may have with women on this subject, give them all the light and help you can. But I would not advise the publication of pamphlets, for they would not be appreciated. The Lord will surely lead you to feel the intense interest in these matters that I do; but your words will just as surely be misconstrued, and this will cut off your influence to a certain degree, and create a state of things for which you are not prepared. If I could see you, I would communicate to you things which I cannot place upon paper. I now say, the Lord bless you, Sister Henry.--Letter 96, 1899, pp. 3-5. (To Mrs. S. M. I. Henry, June 21, 1899.) \n\n\n                                    -162-",
