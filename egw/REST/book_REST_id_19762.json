    "word": "A Brief Visit With W. W. Prescott (To Edson and Emma White)--A week ago last Friday Professor Prescott called to see us on his way from the Northwestern camp meetings. We were glad to meet him, but we had little time to talk with him, as he was anxious to do some writing while here. He spoke on Sabbath morning at the [St. Helena] Sanitarium, and the people were much interested in what he said.--Letter 109, 1903, p. 3 (June, 1903).",
