    "word": "[Sister White:] There are so many things that come in at our camp meetings. But the ministers should get together every day and find out what their true feelings are, and what their spiritual impressions are. You should know that everything is drawing in even lines; that you are standing, as the words were spoken to me, shoulder to shoulder, marching right ahead, and not drawing off. There is unity of heart when the work is carried on in this way, and there will be harmony among all. This will be a wonderful means of the blessing of God resting upon the people. There should be hours when the ministers could get together and pray to God.",
