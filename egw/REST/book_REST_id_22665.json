    "word": "Many of the ministers will not hear and be convinced. They will not enter the sanctuary of truth to receive the knowledge of truth from the word, but will take away the key of knowledge from the people by perversion of the Scriptures, wresting the word of God from its true meaning. Thus every step gained in reaching the people to save them from being lost in error and disobedience requires a hard, constant battle. But shall it stop? No; lift up the standard. Plan memorials of God's truth in every place possible, and conversions will be made. \n                                                                           124\nSome who do not take their stand at once will help advance the work with their means and with their sympathy.",
