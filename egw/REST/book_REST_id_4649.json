    "word": "Let us examine our hearts in the light of the great principle of the law of God as defined by Christ: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God will all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d  [Luke 10:27, 28.] Here the conditions of eternal life are specified. The promise is, \u201cThis do, and thou shalt live.\u201d Are you, my brethren, carrying out these principles in your every-day life? Are there not reasons why you do not come to the light, why you have no freedom in Christ, why you do not find that rest that he has promised to all who come unto him with their burdens?",
