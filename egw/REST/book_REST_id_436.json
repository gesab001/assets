    "word": "As the eyes of Jesus wandered over the multitude about Him, one figure arrested His attention. At the foot of the cross stood His mother, supported by the disciple John. She could not endure to remain away from her Son; and John, knowing that the end was near, had brought her again to the cross. In His dying hour, Christ remembered His mother. Looking into her grief-stricken face and then upon John, He said to her, \u201cWoman, behold thy son!\u201d then to John, \u201cBehold thy mother!\u201d John understood Christ\u2019s words, and accepted the trust. He at once took Mary to his home, and from that hour cared for her tenderly. . . .",
