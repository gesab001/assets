    "word": "Friday, May 20, 1898. Sara and I went to Morisset. We mailed our letters at Cooranbong. We took the twins with us. They are very interesting little fellows, chattering to the birds and to the logging bullock teams which we met and which we passed. . . . I had risen early in the morning to get off letters for the office and was very thankful to keep out in the open air. . . . The work that needs to be done is to open the way that children may take in the fact that Jesus loves them and will be greatly pleased if they will love Him and give their young hearts to Him. Parents and children should be united in their willing service to God.--Ms 182, 1898, pp. 1, 2, 6, 15. (Diary, May, 1898.)",
