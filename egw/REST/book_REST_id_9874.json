    "word": "I have given you this brief recital of personal experience, in order to show you that I know something about the use of natural means for the restoration of the sick. God will work wonders for every one of us if we work in faith, acting as we believe, that when we cooperate with Him, He is ready to do His part.

Many who have gone down into the grave might today be living, if they had cooperated with God. Let us be sensible men and women in regard to these matters.--Manuscript 50, 1902. \n                                                                           310",
