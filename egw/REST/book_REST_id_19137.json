    "word": "And our dear Brother C, whom I love in the Lord, may the way be opened before him so that his good conscience may not be wounded by his temporal prosperity. I believe he will see his way out more clearly where he will have fewer perplexities and can devote his precious influence more fully to the precious cause of Christ. God loves Brother C, and we feel the deepest interest in his dear family.",
