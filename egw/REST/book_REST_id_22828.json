    "word": "Commercial enterprises often work to a large degree counter to the purpose for which our institutions are established. They detract from the influence which God desires shall attend the work. The condition brought about is sometimes the condition in which Christ found the barren fig-tree. Searching for fruit with which to satisfy His need, the Saviour found nothing but a show of leaves. In visions of the night I have seen Christ searching in our institutions for fruit, for that virtue revealed in the lives of His workers that tells in the saving of the soul unto eternal life. You have a noble work to do in praying with the sick, and in feeding their souls with the bread of life. You are to be God's medical missionary, teaching souls what it means to eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God. Christ explains the meaning of these words, \"The flesh profiteth nothing,\" He said; \"the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" You have the ability to speak in a pleasant, intelligent, interesting way to the sick. It is your privilege to inspire them with hope and courage, and lead them to a knowledge of the truth of the word.",
