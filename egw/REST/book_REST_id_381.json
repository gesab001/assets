We reached Chicago Wednesday evening between the hours of eight and nine, and stopped at the Eagle Hotel. I was very weary. Thursday morning I laid down in my room to rest while your father went out in the city. He returned just in time to take the cars, and brought a basket of fruit\u2014of tomatoes, peaches, and apples. They were very \n78\nnice. We ate the fruit with our bread taken from home.",
