    "word": "Recently the question has been raised, What shall we do with the Colorado Sanitarium? The light given me has been that the plans followed in the building up of this institution were not altogether in accordance with the mind and will of God. Too much money was invested in the building. But after the investment has been made, the buildings erected, and our workers have gone in there, and wrestled and wrestled to make the work a success, and the sanitarium has accomplished much good, shall we turn over the place to private parties? After the workers have wrestled all these years, shall those now connected with it give it up, and say they are beaten? We can not have it so. No such representation of our work is to be made before the world. Every soul connected with that sanitarium is to realize that the institution is to be made a success; and it will be a success if there be shown that faith in God which will enable the workers to take hold of His promises.",
