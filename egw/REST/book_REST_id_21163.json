    "word": "One of Satan's grandest aims is to lead every individual Christian to fix his eye on self as possessing capabilities and powers to do great things. Self-righteousness and supposed wisdom will lead into false paths. Let us individually be on guard. Let all our words be right, and whatever we have to do, do it as if we could see Jesus with open vision at our right hand. Do not consult worldly men, making their knowledge and their decisions supreme. If we do, we shall be led into delusions. \"Come unto Me,\" says Christ. In Him is rest, quietude, and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.",
