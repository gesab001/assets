    "word": "Let all be careful not to discourage the pioneers, or cause them to feel that there is little they can do.  Their influence may still be mightily exerted in the work of the Lord.  The testimony of the aged ministers will ever be a help and a blessing to the church.  God will watch over His tried and faithful standard-bearers, night and day, until the time comes for them to lay off their armor.  Let them be assured that they are under the protecting care of Him who never slumbers or sleeps; that they are watched over by unwearied sentinels. Knowing this, and realizing that they are abiding in Christ, they may rest trustfully in the providences of God.",
