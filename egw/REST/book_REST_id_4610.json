    "word": "He who is called of God to so sacred a work should put all his energies to its accomplishment. Every other consideration should become secondary to this great object. He should feel the solemn obligations resting upon him, one whom God has honored by choosing to unite him with the angels in the work of ministering to souls and enlightening them with the divine truth. The history of our Saviour's conflict in the wilderness of temptation, his life of self-sacrificing love, his soul agony in Gethsemane, the cruelty of the judgment hall, and the agony upon the cross, all combine to teach a lesson of self-sacrifice, of patience under affliction, of \n361\nsolemn consecration to God, and of fitting preparation for his holy work.",
