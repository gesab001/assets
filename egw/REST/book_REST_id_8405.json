    "word": "Ministers should not first seek to convert unbelievers, but to secure an army of workers.--A serious and perhaps unsuspected hindrance to the success of the truth is to be found in our churches themselves. When an effort is made to present our faith to unbelievers, the members of the church too often stand back, as though they were not an interested party, and let all the burden rest upon the minister. For this reason the labor of our most able ministers has been at times productive of little good. The very best sermons\n151\nmay be preached, the message may be just what the people need, and yet no souls are gained as sheaves to present to Christ.",
