    "word": "Sabbath, August 25, we all went out on the school land, and made ourselves comfortable in the woods. I had my folding chair; Brother Lawrence made a seat for his wife; and Brother Tucker and others seated themselves on the four rugs on the ground. I read two articles to them in which they seemed much interested. We then sang a hymn, and had a season of prayer. After we had eaten some oranges, we returned home. We all had a good appetite for our dinner. We enjoyed being on the school land amid the trees and the beautiful things of nature. I love to be in the groves where I can hear the birds sing.",
