    "word": "Joshua a Wise, Consecrated Leader\n \n\n     No stain rested upon the holy character of Joshua. He was a wise leader. His life was wholly devoted to God. Before he died he assembled the Hebrew host, and, following the example of Moses, he recapitulated their travels in the wilderness and also the merciful dealings of God with them. He then eloquently addressed them. He related to them that the king of Moab warred against them and called Balaam to curse them; but God \"would not hearken unto Balaam, therefore he blessed you still.\" He then said to them, \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether the gods\n182\nwhich your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.",
