    "word": "Ministers must impress upon those for whom they labor the importance of bearing burdens in connection with the work of God. The people must be taught that every department of the work of God \n100\nshould enlist their support and engage their interest. The great missionary field is open to us, and the subject must be agitated, agitated, again and again. The people must understand that it is not the hearers of the word but the doers of the word who will have eternal life. Not one is exempted from this work of benevolence. All who become partakers of the grace of Christ are not only to communicate of their substance to advance the truth, but to give themselves to God without reserve.\u2014MS.",
