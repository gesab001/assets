    "word": "There is a real work to be wrought in us. Constantly we must submit our will to God's will, our way to God's way. Our peculiar ideas will strive constantly for the supremacy, but we must make God all and in all. We are not free from the failings of humanity, but we must constantly strive to be free from these failings, not to be perfect in our own eyes but perfect in every good work. We must not dwell on the dark side; our souls must not rest in self, but in the One who is all and in all.",
