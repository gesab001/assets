    "word": "MR No. 843 - Geological Field Conference - 1981\n\n     Scenery Near Moutier, Switzerland--May 21. We have rested well through the night. We found accommodations in a very nice hotel in the village of Moutier. This is a very beautiful valley. It has seemed as we are winding our course through the defile of the mountains that we should come to where the mountains would block our way, but the road winds on through the openings of the mountains.",
