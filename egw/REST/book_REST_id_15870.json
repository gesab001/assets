    "word": "Never give up your faith and hope in God. Cling to the promises. Do not trust in your feelings, but in the naked Word of God. Believe the assurances of the Lord. Take your stand upon the plain \"Thus saith the Lord,\" and rest there, feeling or no feeling. Faith is not always followed by feelings of ecstasy, but \"hope thou in God.\" Trust fully in Him. . . .",
