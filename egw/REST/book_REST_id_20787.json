    "word": "In order to be a co-laborer with Christ, man must put away his supposed wisdom. Then he will be humble enough to wear Christ's yoke and to receive His Spirit, the gift that brings to the soul rest and peace. Christ's invitation is, \"'Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.' In learning the lessons I teach, in cherishing the grace of patience and forbearance, in striving to control the thoughts and words, in revealing Christlike love for one another, you will learn to be meek and lowly, and you will find the peace and rest that is more precious than gold.\"",
