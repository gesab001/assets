    "word": "MR No. 1525 - Divinely Led to Buy Elmshaven; Warning Against Fanatical Movements; Search the Word, and Believe its Promises\n\n     (Written October 10, 1900, from St. Helena, California, to Elder and Mrs. S. N. Haskell. Portions of this manuscript appear in Manuscript Releases 284 and 704; The Faith I Live By; Selected Messages, book 2; and Revival and Beyond.) \n\n\n     I have received several letters from you, one of which was sent to Australia and returned to me here. I send you a copy of a letter written to Brother and Sister Farnsworth. I could not get all copied that I had written, so I sent that which I had, and just got it copied in time for the Vancouver mail. I am much interested in all that you write me.",
