    "word": "St. Helena Sanitarium, California, September 28 [27], 1907 \n\n     I thank the Lord this Friday morning [that] I have had the first good night's rest for weeks. I have spent hours in the night season pleading with God. I have been so very much surprised to see the spirit of dictatorial authority in men. It has seemed to me next to impossible to convince or convert the men who have received this kind of spirit, of its danger. Their own souls are in peril, but they perceive it not. What is lacking? Consecration of the heart to God.",
