    "word": "The children are God's property, and it is the duty of every church member to take an interest in their salvation. Because some children do not belong to your own family is no excuse for neglecting or mistreating them. You are to cooperate with Christ in seeking and saving that which has been lost. Let us not shrink from bearing responsibilities. I thank the Lord that I have in the past taken some responsibilities in caring for children. I have taken several into my own home, and have done my best to educate and train them for God.",
