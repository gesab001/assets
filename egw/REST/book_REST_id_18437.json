    "word": "I have a deep interest for you in Africa, and from the light which the Lord has been pleased to give me in regard to that country the Lord has many precious souls to hear the message of mercy and warning to be given to the world. If the workers will hide themselves in Jesus and let Jesus alone appear, if they will walk humbly with God, if they will be doers of the lessons Jesus Christ has given us in His Word, then the heavenly intelligences will co-operate with their efforts, and they will not take one particle of glory to themselves but give all the glory to God. You will surely see of the salvation of God as you look to Jesus and trust wholly in Him, for then He will clothe you all with the garments of His righteousness. The great danger will arise from individuals seeking to be first. The Lord Jesus has no sympathy with this spirit and will leave any soul who will seek for the supremacy for himself.",
