    "word": "All the work of canvassing should be considered as evangelistic work. The Lord will give His grace to all those who will seek for it in humility, and He will open ways for the dropping of seeds of truth into good soil. We have no time to lose, no hours or moments to devote to selfish pleasure. We, as workers together with God, are to labor with all interest and earnest energy to pull souls out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted with the flesh. [Jude 13.]",
