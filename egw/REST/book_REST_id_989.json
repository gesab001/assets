    "word": "O what an assurance is this, that the love of God may abide in the hearts of all who believe in him! O what salvation is provided; for he is able to save unto the uttermost all that come unto God by him. In wonder we exclaim, How can these things be? But Jesus will be satisfied with nothing less than this. Those who are partakers of his sufferings here, of his humiliation, enduring for his name's sake, are to have the love of God bestowed upon them as it was upon the Son. One who knows, has said, \"The Father himself loveth you.\" [John 16:27.] One who has had an experimental knowledge of the length, and breadth, \n                                                                           76\nand height, and depth of that love, has declared unto us this amazing fact. This love is ours through faith in the Son of God, therefore a connection with Christ means everything to us. We are to be one with him as he is one with the Father, and then we are beloved by the infinite God as members of the body of Christ, as branches of the living Vine. We are to be attached to the parent stock, and to  receive nourishment from the Vine. Christ is our glorified Head, and the divine love flowing from the heart of God, rests in Christ, and is communicated to those who have been united to him. This divine love entering the soul inspires it with gratitude, frees it from its spiritual feebleness, from pride, vanity, and selfishness, and from all that would deform the Christian character.",
