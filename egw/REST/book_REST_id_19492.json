    "word": "Periods of Rest Needed.--My brother, you are in need of rest. The mere matter of speaking in your meetings is not the real cause of your becoming exhausted as you do. This exhaustion is caused by the intense strain brought on you by your preparation for these meetings. You put great intensity of thought into the effort to get everything ready in the most expensive style. This effort wears on you. You become worried and confused. You must make a change. You cannot afford to spend the hours for sleep in the preparation of charts and in other work which requires intense mental effort.",
