    "word": "Do not flatter yourselves that if you should yield the truth all obstacles to your acquiring property would be removed. Satan tells you this; it is his sophistry. If God's blessing rests upon you because you surrender all to Him, you will prosper. If you turn from God, He will turn from you. His hand can scatter faster than you can gather. \"What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\"",
