    "word": "I have a deep interest in your spiritual welfare, and in that of your whole family. You are each living your probationary time day by day, obtaining your experience as the days pass; but you can go over the ground only once. Then let every precious moment be employed as you will wish it had been when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened. Our Lord will judge us according to the opportunities and privileges that we have had.",
