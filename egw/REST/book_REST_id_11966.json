    "word": "A compelling power moved the honest, while the manifestation of the power of God brought a fear and restraint upon their unbelieving relatives and friends so that they dared not, neither had they the power to, hinder those who felt the work of the Spirit of God upon them. The last call was carried even to the poor slaves; and the pious among them poured forth their songs of rapturous joy at the prospect of their happy deliverance. [NOTE.--THAT THERE WILL BE SLAVERY AT THE TIME OF THE SECOND ADVENT IS MADE CLEAR BY THE PROPHET JOHN IN REVELATION 6:15, 16, IN HIS VIVID DESCRIPTION OF \"EVERY BONDMAN, AND EVERY FREE MAN\" CALLING FOR THE \"MOUNTAINS AND ROCKS\" TO FALL ON THEM AND HIDE THEM \"FROM THE FACE OF HIM THAT SITTETH ON THE THRONE.\"--COMPILERS.] Their masters could not\n401\ncheck them; fear and astonishment kept them silent. Mighty miracles were wrought, the sick were healed, and signs and wonders followed the believers. God was in the work, and every saint, fearless of consequences, followed the convictions of his own conscience and united with those who were keeping all the commandments of God; and with power they sounded abroad the third message. I saw that this message will close with power and strength far exceeding the midnight cry.",
