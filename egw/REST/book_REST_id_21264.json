    "word": "All who have a part in God's work are to remember that He is the Ruler, and that those who have been appointed to take charge of His work must be under His rulership, body, soul, and spirit. And they are to remember that it is not enough that they do no wrong; they are not to suffer wrong to be done. They themselves must cherish a fear to offend God that will effectually restrain them from doing evil.",
