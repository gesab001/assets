    "word": "Counsels Regarding Preaching--I have a little counsel for you from the Lord. I have been talking with the brethren, telling them [about] the light which the Lord has given. This word has come for you: \"Be careful, and let not our labors be largely preaching.\" You cannot, Brother Anderson, accomplish good in thus doing. Speak short, both yourself and Brother Belden, and have the living Bread of Heaven to give to those who shall come to hear; for if you talk lengthily, there will soon be a loss of interest. Speak the important truth right to the point. If your souls thirst for the water of life, you will have the living water to impart to others, but if your own souls are not quickened by the life and Spirit of the Lord, the Lord would not have you make dry and uninteresting remarks.",
