    "word": "HOLINESS REIGNS SUPREME.\u2014In heaven God is all in all. There, holiness reigns supreme; there is nothing to mar \n64\nthe perfect harmony with God. If we are indeed journeying thither, the spirit of heaven will dwell in our hearts here. But if we find no pleasure now in the contemplation of heavenly things; if we have no interest in seeking the knowledge of God, no delight in beholding the character of Christ; if holiness has no attractions for us\u2014then we may be sure that our hope of heaven is vain. Perfect conformity to the will of God is the high aim to be constantly before the Christian. He will love to talk of God, of Jesus, of the home of bliss and purity which Christ has prepared for them that love Him. The contemplation of these themes, when the soul feasts upon the blessed assurances of God, the apostle represents as tasting \u201cthe powers of the world to come.\u201dBible Echo September 1, 1889 quoted in ML 293.",
