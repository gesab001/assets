    "word": "Creating a Difficult Field for Others.--Ministers who are not men of vital piety, who stir up an interest among the people but leave the work in the rough, leave an exceedingly difficult field for others to enter and finish the work they failed to complete. These men will be proved; and if they do not do their work more faithfully, they will, after a still further test, be laid aside as cumberers of the ground, unfaithful watchmen.--Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 317.
