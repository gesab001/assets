    "word": "Provision must first be made for the teachers and for those who act a part in the work of the school. A few families who have proved themselves to be wise and loyal supporters of our educational work may be encouraged to make homes near by or on the school farm; but our people generally should not be encouraged to come in and make their homes at Sonoma. Let not the parents cherish the idea that they can do this, for in nine cases out of ten it will not be for the best interests of the children. In most cases it will be a blessing for the youth if they can be away from their parents, and under the management of qualified teachers in the school. The presentation in spiritual lines would be clearer and the development of character would be far more encouraging.",
