    "word": "Special Edition of Early Writings \n\n     [In 1908 Elder S. N. Haskell, President of the California Conference, observing what seemed to him to be a minimum of interest of the publishers in endeavoring to supply Early Writings at a low, popular price, proposed that a privately-printed, pocket-size edition could be printed for 20 cents. This could be sold widely and given a good distribution, and at the same time bring Ellen G. White some financial relief. Her first reaction was favorable, but changed after receiving instruction in vision. We quote from two letters written to Elder Haskell.]",
