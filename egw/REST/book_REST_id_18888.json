    "word": "Copenhagen, Monday, October 12, 1885--Brother and Sister Matteson and Willie and myself rode ten miles on the cars into the country. We saw much that was interesting--very fine houses, large fisheries, many nets that were hung to dry. We walked out upon the pier looking into the ocean. The water for a long distance was as clear as crystal. The bottom was pure-white sand, \n\n\n                                   -159- \n\nwith some mounds of moss, which made the sight very beautiful. We walked to the park. It is a forest of beech trees principally, but there are some evergreens also interspersed.",
