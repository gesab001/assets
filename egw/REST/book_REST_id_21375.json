    "word": "We must learn His meekness and lowliness before we realize the fulfillment of the promise, \"Ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" It is by learning the habits of Christ, His meekness, His lowliness, that self becomes transformed--by taking Christ's yoke upon you and then submitting to learn. There is no one who has not much to learn. All must come under training by Jesus Christ. When they fall upon Christ, their own hereditary and cultivated traits of character are taken away as hindrances to their being partakers of the divine nature. When self dies, then Christ lives in the human agent. He abides in Christ, and Christ lives in him.",
