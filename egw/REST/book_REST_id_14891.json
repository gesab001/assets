    "word": "There is real common sense in dietetic reform. The subject should be studied broadly and deeply, and no one should criticize others because their practice is not, in all things, in harmony with his own. It is impossible to make an unvarying rule to regulate every one's habits, and no one should think himself a criterion for all. Not all can eat the same things. Foods that are palatable and wholesome to one person may be distasteful, and even harmful, to another. Some can not use milk, while others thrive on it. Some persons can not digest peas and beans; others find them wholesome. For some the coarser grain preparations are good food, while others can not use them.  {TSDF 43.10}  \n                                                     M. H.--321-324 \n     Some are continually anxious lest their food, however simple and healthful, may hurt them. To these let me say: Do not think that your food will \n\n44 \n\ninjure you; do not think about it at all. Eat according to your best judgment; and when you have asked the Lord to bless the food for the strengthening of your body, believe that He hears your prayer, and be at rest.  {TSDF 43.11}  \n     Because principle requires us to discard those things that irritate the stomach and impair health, we should remember that an impoverished diet produces poverty of the blood. Cases of disease most difficult to cure result from this cause. The system is not sufficiently nourished, and dyspepsia and general debility are the result. Those who use such a diet are not always compelled by poverty to do so, but they choose it through ignorance or negligence, or to carry out their erroneous ideas of reform. . . .",
