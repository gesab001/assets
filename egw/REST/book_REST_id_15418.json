    "word": "Christ has declared our position. \"He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\" (John 8:12). He is Himself the bright and morning Star. He is the Sun of Righteousness, the brightness of His Father's glory. He is the \"true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world\" (chap. 1:9). A Physician, a Healer, He came to restore the moral image of God that was lost by transgression.",
