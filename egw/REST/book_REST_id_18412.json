    "word": "At two o'clock we were again seated in the compartment for ladies, with every convenience, and were glad to be alone and to rest. I was sick and tired, unable to eat.

We had no further disturbances till after this.--Ms 32, 1887, pp. 1-9, Entire Ms. (\"Visit to Germany,\" Diary, May 26-31, 1887.)",
