    "word": "Wednesday, Sept. 24, 1873. We had most beautiful scenery most of the way. Autumn's glory is seen in the variegated golden and scarlet trees among the dark evergreens. The towering mountains are all around us. . . . We stopped at Grand River for dinner. We had some difficulty in finding a carriage road, but after some delay, and one on horseback searching carefully, we could pass on. We had a very rough road. We arrived at Grand Lake about five o'clock. Pitched our tent in a good dry spot and were tired enough to rest that night.",
