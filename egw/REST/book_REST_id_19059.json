I have given him a message,\" For Christ's sake, do believe, and rest in faith and simple trust. \n\n\n                                   -240- \n\nCultivate restfulness, and commit the keeping of your soul to His trust. He is not pleased to have us cover His altar with our tears and complaints. You have enough to praise God for already, if you do not see another soul converted; but the good work will go on if you will only go forward, and not be trying to adjust everything to your own ideas. Let the peace of God rule in your heart, and be ye thankful. Let the Lord have room to work. Do not block His way. He can and will work if we will let Him. . . .",
