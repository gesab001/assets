    "word": "Responsibility of Parents \n\n     Parents should arouse and in the fear of God inquire, What is truth? A tremendous responsibility rests upon them.

The great mass are as ignorant and indifferent in regard to the physical and moral education of their children as the animal creation. And yet they dare assume the responsibilities of parents.",
