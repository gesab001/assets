    "word": "There now stands in Orebro, in a little park in front of the college, a monument erected over fifty years ago to the memory of these remarkable men, and bearing the inscription, \u201cIn memory of Olaf and Lawrence Patersen, the first preachers of the Lutheran doctrine in Sweden, born in Orebro. Daniel 12:3.\u201d Just across the river is a beautiful park, and to the right stands \u201cEngelbrekt Slott,\u201d one of the oldest castles in Sweden. For many years this castle was also the prison for the district, and it was here, no doubt, that those arrested for preaching the Lord's soon coming in 1843 were imprisoned. Some of our friends visited the dark room in the round tower that was used as a prison; they also visited the large prison built since, in which Bro. Rosqvist was confined for preaching the present truth in Grythyttehed.",
