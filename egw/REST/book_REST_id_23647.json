    "word": "As God's Word is received as food for the soul, the character in spiritual lines will correspond to the truths of the gospel that have been eaten and digested. Thus our spiritual strength will be refreshed as we become partakers of the divine nature, having overcome the corruption that is in the world through lust. The nutritious properties of the heavenly food may be compared with the strength-restoring properties of the leaves of the tree of life, which are for the healing of the nations. Seek for unity, and seek it in faith. Faith we must have, in order that we may walk by faith.",
