    "word": "But, brethren, do not be unfaithful in your lot. Stand in your place. Do not by your neglect of duty increase our financial difficulties and thus add to the heavy burden that rests on the president of our General Conference. The conferences, through their delegates, have appointed the one who occupies this difficult and important place, and they are under obligation to sustain him by bearing their part of the burden. Elder Olsen is far from coveting the position. He has said again and again, \"Do not lay the burden on me; I am not fitted for such a position.\" But where are the men who are fitted? They are few indeed. Elder Olsen is a man who loves and fears God. The church needs his labors. He must not be left alone to bear heavy burdens that others will let fall upon him because of their backslidings.",
