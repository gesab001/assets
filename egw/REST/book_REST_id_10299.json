    "word": "Christ represented His Father to the world, and He represents before God the chosen ones in whom He has restored the moral image of God. They are His heritage. To them He says, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\" \"No man knoweth . . . the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\" No priest, no religionist, can reveal the Father to any son or daughter of Adam.",
