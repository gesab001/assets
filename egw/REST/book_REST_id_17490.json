    "word": "The General Conference is assuredly embracing altogether too many weighty responsibilities. It can not carry them with the present corps of workers. It is best for our brethren in Battle Creek to think more deeply and pray more earnestly before they shall make any further moves to enfold all the publishing interests. You are in need of the teachings and leadings of the Holy Spirit of God. Let your managing forces walk humbly with God, and seek wisdom from Him to manage the interests that have already accumulated at Battle Creek. You will need a much more efficient staff than you now have to do even this. When the present inefficient corps undertakes the management of the publishing work in the whole field, they are acting contrary to the will of God. I protest against it in the name of the Lord.",
