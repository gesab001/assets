    "word": "The only reason that you or I shall be able to give for our salvation, if we are saved at last, will be, \"Christ died for me, and His blood cleansed me from all sin.\" Your heart must be touched with the subduing love of Christ before you will attain to the perfection of Christian character. Your experience is lacking in spirituality. I feel a deep, earnest interest in you, my brother, and desire that you may have a different experience. It savors too much of self, and too little of Jesus' love and tender compassion. There is need of your seeking the Lord more earnestly, perseveringly, and believingly, than you have done.",
