    "word": "The Lord wants us to be Christlike, to represent to the world the beauties of Christian character. This has not always been done in this place by all the workers. When the character of Christ is reflected in God's professed people, they will desire, not the place of greatest honor, but the place that God chooses for them. \"Learn of Me\", the great Teacher said, \"for I am meek, (1002) and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Christ wants us to work out the dispositions that He will work in, as we yield our lives to His fashioning.",
