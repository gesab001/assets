    "word": "Parents do not always move wisely. Many are very exacting in wishing to bring others to their ideas, and become impatient and overbearing if they cannot do this; but when their own children are required to observe rules and regulations at school, and these children fret under the necessary restraint, too often their parents, who profess to love and fear God, join with the children instead of reproving them, and correcting their faults. This often proves the turning point in the character of their children. Rules and order are broken down, and discipline is trampled under foot.--\"Testimony,\" No. 29. \n\n                                               -",
