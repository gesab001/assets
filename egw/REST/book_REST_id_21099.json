    "word": "Missions are to be established in our large cities. Those of our people who are in business for themselves should take a practical interest in these missions, making them gifts of provision, bedding, and furniture. Our missions should be provided with comfortable beds, for the mission workers, returning from their labor at night, need a place where they can obtain their needed rest.",
