    "word": "The Scriptures say, \u201cIf a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\u201d \u201cMoreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.\u201d When a man has a suspicion of another, he should go to the one suspected of wrong and tell him his fault, as the scripture says, \u201cbetween thee and him alone.\u201d \u201cIf he will hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.\u201d Never is a member of the church to be treated as a rebel until every possible means has been used to bring about an understanding. We are strictly to follow the directions that Christ has taken special pains to give to the church. Not one item is to be disregarded.",
