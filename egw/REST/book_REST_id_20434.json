    "word": "Brother Daniells, I wrote you a few lines in reference to Brother Davis. Evil angels are all about him, and at times have control of him in a strange, revolting way. I did not mean to speak of this to anyone, but I have the word from the Lord that he is possessed of an evil spirit and \"has no power from the snare to go.\" His case is like the cases of ancient times. At times, he thinks, speaks, and acts under the influence of satanic agencies, and does revolting things. This casts him into despair. His only hope is to present his case before his brethren who have a living connection with God. The spell will be broken only by most earnest wrestling with God, and this I present to you. Why I spoke of his remaining in Sydney was that he could be in connection with those that could help him during the camp \n\n\n                                  -344- \n\nmeeting. As soon as possible, this demon-tempter's power must be broken. The more Brother Davis is pressed into the work of God with those that are connected with God, the less power Satan will have over him. But Satan must be rebuked as in olden time, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. This in faith we must ask the Lord to do, and He will fulfill His word. The Lord will hear prayer. Brother Davis' connection [with] spirits, his experience in theosophy, is his curse. Labor we must to have the man dispossessed.",
