    "word": "It is the duty of mothers to cultivate their minds and keep their hearts pure. They should improve every means within their reach for their intellectual and moral improvement, that they may be qualified to improve the minds of their children.

The mind hungers for the varying, exciting scenes of worldly life. . . .",
