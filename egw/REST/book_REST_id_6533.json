C., and proceeded at once to inspect the outlying portions of the District of Columbia for suitable properties. Morning by morning, before going out, they met to pray earnestly for divine guidance. And their prayers were signally answered. In Takoma Park, one of the most attractive and healthful of the towns near Washington, was found a tract of fifty acres, which seemed to meet all requirements.
