    "word": "6. God Marks Every Action.--The Lord saw the wrath of Cain, He saw the falling of his countenance. Thus is revealed how closely the Lord marks every action, all the intents and purposes, yes, even the expression of the countenance. This, though man may say nothing, expresses his refusal to do the way and will of God. . . . Well might the question be asked you of the Lord, when you cannot follow the impulse of your own rebellious heart, and are restrained from doing your own unrighteous, unsanctified will, \"Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?\" Such exhibitions reveal that because they cannot do after Satan's arts and devices they are provoked, and can only manifest a spirit similar to that of Cain (MS 77, 1897).",
