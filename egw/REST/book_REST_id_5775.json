    "word": "On the morning of November 26, I left Basle for Torre Pellice, Italy, accompanied by my daughter, Mary K. White, and Eld. B. L. Whitney. It was my fifty-eighth birthday, and surely it was to be celebrated in a way and place that I had little dreamed of. It seemed hard for me to realize that I was in Europe; that I had borne my testimony in England, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and was on my way to labor in Italy. In my youth I felt a strong desire to be a child of God, and \n227\nas his Spirit began to impress my heart, and I tried in feebleness to obey its promptings, I received increased strength, and my desire to do good also increased. I have ever found plenty of work to do, and I have also learned that in Christ alone there is rest, peace, or happiness. In God is our only help. I have tried all these years not to build my hopes on this world, but to lay up a treasure above.",
