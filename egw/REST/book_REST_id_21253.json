    "word": "The institute closed last Thursday, but so great was the interest that we felt that the meetings could not be entirely discontinued. I spoke to the people Sabbath morning, and Elder Starr spoke in the afternoon. The tent was full, and several strangers were present. Meetings were held Sunday afternoon and evening, and so many strangers were present that those who had returned to their homes from the institute were scarcely missed. The Spirit of the Lord was in our meetings.",
