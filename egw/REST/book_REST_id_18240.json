    "word": "In Christ's parable of the talents are included all responsible human agents, from the humblest and poorest in this world's goods to those who are entrusted with talents of means and of intellect. Even those who faithfully use the least of talents will hear from the Saviour's lips the words of commendation, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" The value that God places on the least of talents is shown by the reward He gives for its right use,-- eternal life. To every faithful steward He will say, \"Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"",
