If I keep silent I shall not be excused. The testimonies which I had for different ones in O. have been written but with great pain of heart. But I did not dare do otherwise with the light given to me from Heaven. In my last vision I was shown that these testimonies have not been received, and wrought that reformation in life that God designed they should.",
