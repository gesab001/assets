    "word": "When we were seated in the automobile, ready to return to Glendale, not a few colored sisters pressed about the conveyance to see and speak with me. They expressed their appreciation of the discourse. Cheerfulness and happiness was expressed in their countenances, and it was a scene of cheerful parting. I shall long remember that interesting meeting, and the stillness and peacefulness expressed in the countenances of both white and colored people.--Letter 36, 1910, p. 2. (To Edson and Emma White, April 3, 1910.) \n\nReleased May 20, 1977.",
