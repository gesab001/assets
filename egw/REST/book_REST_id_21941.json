    "word": "To these students I would say, Do not think it is an amusing thing to take advantage of a fellow student, and to lead him astray. God wants you to be constantly reaching higher and still higher for attainments that will enable you to help others, to be an example to those around you. And as you do this, the Lord will surely let His blessing rest upon you. But do not go only half way in your efforts to serve God. Do not feel that there is no need of being particular. You do need to be particular to avoid evil, even the appearance of evil, from the oldest to the youngest. It is possible for the youth to be such earnest Christians that through them the Lord will send the truth home to those who have never known Him.",
