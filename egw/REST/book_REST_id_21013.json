    "word": "From the hillside He looked upon the moving multitude, and His heart was stirred with sympathy. Interrupted as He was, and robbed of His rest, He was not impatient. He saw a greater necessity demanding His attention as He watched the people coming and still coming. He was \"moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd\" [Mark 6:34]. Leaving His retreat, He found a convenient place where He could minister to them. They received no help from the priests and rulers, but the healing waters of life flowed from Christ as He taught the multitude the way of salvation.",
