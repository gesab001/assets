    "word": "Bro. D. T. B. overtaxed his strength last season, in laboring in new fields with the tent, without suitable help. God does not require brother D., or any of his servants, to injure their health by exposure and taxing labor. The brethren at Bordoville should have felt an interest that would have been shown by their works. They could have secured help if they had been awake to the interest of the cause of God, and felt the worth of souls. While brother D. was feeling a deep sense of the work of God and the value of souls, which called for continual effort, a large church at Bordoville was holding brother A. from helping his brother by their petty difficulties. These brothers should come up with renewed courage, shake themselves from the trials and discouragements which have held them at Bordoville, and crippled their testimony, and they should claim strength from the Mighty One. They should have borne a plain, free testimony \n                                                                           169\nto Brn. S. and C., and urged the truth home, and done what they could to have these men make a proper distribution of their property. Brother A., in taking so many burdens, is lessening his mental and physical strength.",
