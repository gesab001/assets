    "word": "Friday, November 22, Elder Prescott, who is the principal of our college, made request for me to meet with them Sabbath afternoon in their social meeting in the college. I had been suffering with infirmities and thought it not prudent to do this. But my heart turned toward the students and my great interest and desire for the welfare of their souls made me earnest to go. We found a large number of the students assembled. It was \n\n\n                                     -113- \n\nnot only a precious occasion but a blessed sight to see the  attentive, earnest, intelligent countenances.",
