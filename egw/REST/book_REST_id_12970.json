    "word": "This has been very discouraging to physicians and helpers; but they should remember Christ, their great Pattern, and not become weary in well-doing. If one among a large number is grateful and exerts a right influence, they should thank God and take courage. That one may be a stranger, and the inquiry may arise: Where are the nine? Why do not all Sabbathkeepers give their interest and support in favor of the Health Institute? Some Sabbathkeepers have so little interest that, while receiving attention at the Institute free of charge, they will speak disparagingly to patients of the means employed for the recovery of the sick. I wish such to consider their course. The Lord regards them as He did the nine lepers who returned not to give Him glory. Strangers do their duty and appreciate the efforts made for their recovery, while these cast an influence against those who have tried to do them good.",
