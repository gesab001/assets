    "word": "Since I left my home in California in April I have visited many places and have spoken to thousands of people. This is the last stop I expect to make before reaching my home again. I would leave these words with you: Carry the work forward in faith and humble dependence upon God. Let each \n\n\n                                  -322- \n\nbeliever have light in himself; then the blessing of God will rest upon you, and you will see the salvation of God in the advancement of His work in this place.--Manuscript 93, 1909, pp. 5-6. (\"Address to the Church Members in Salt Lake City,\" September 7, 1909.)",
