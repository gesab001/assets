    "word": "What shall ministers teach the people?--Certainly not fables. Certainly not their own foolish imaginings, which would put a yoke grievous to be borne upon the necks of poor souls. Such a yoke Christ has not formed. It galls, it brings unrest, disquietude, and discouragement. Bearing Christ's yoke brings rest, peace, obedience, for His yoke is easy and His burden is light. . . .",
