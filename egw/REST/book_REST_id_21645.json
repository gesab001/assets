    "word": "8. Battle Creek, Michigan, [THIS ACCOUNT SEEMS \n             TO BE INTRODUCED WITH THE WORDS, \"NOV. 21 DURING \n             THE NIGHT SEASON\" (DIARY, P. 321). ELLEN WHITE WAS IN \n             BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, ON NOVEMBER 21. BUT PART OF THE \n             ACCOUNT, AT LEAST, WAS WRITTEN IN BATTLE CREEK, \n             MICHIGAN, FOR SHE SPEAKS OF \"THE FACILITIES HERE IN \n             BATTLE CREEK\" (DIARY, P. 323). JUDGING FROM THE COLOR \n             OF INK IN THE DIARY, IT APPEARS THAT AFTER SHE WROTE, \n             \"NOV. 21 DURING THE NIGHT SEASON,\" ELLEN WHITE \n             LEFT THE REST OF THAT PAGE AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING \n             PAGE BLANK, TO BE FILLED IN LATER. SHE THEN USED THE \n             TOP OF P. 323 FOR A BRIEF ENTRY FOR FRIDAY, NOVEMBER \n             21. ON NOVEMBER 22 SHE SKIPPED ANOTHER PAGE (P. 324) \n             AND RECORDED HER ENTRY FOR THE 22ND (SABBATH) AT THE \n             TOP OF P. 325. AT SOME POINT AFTER HER RETURN TO \n             BATTLE CREEK ON DECEMBER 30, SHE RETURNED TO THESE \n             LARGELY BLANK PAGES (PP. 321-326) AND FILLED THEM \n             UP. HER COMMENTS SEEM TO INCLUDE DESCRIPTIONS OF NOT \n             ONE, BUT TWO, NIGHT VISIONS.] Early 1891 \n\n\n     I was specially moved upon by the Spirit of God. My soul had been drawn out in earnest supplication to God. I was distressed on account of the \n\n\n                                     -59- \n\nbacksliding of His people. While lying in bed, unable to sleep because of the burden resting upon me, I was pleading with the Lord. I fell asleep, and in the night season I was taught of God.",
