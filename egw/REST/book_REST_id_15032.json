    "word": "R. & H.--'83, No. 44 (H. L. para. 421) \n     Our tables should bear only the most wholesome food, free from every irritating substance. The appetite for liquor is encouraged by the preparation of food with condiments and spices. These cause a feverish state of the system, and drink is demanded to allay the irritation. On my frequent journeys across the continent, I do not patronize restaurants, dining-cars, or hotels, for the simple reason that I can not eat the food there provided. The dishes are highly seasoned with salt and pepper, creating an almost intolerable thirst. . . . They irritate and inflame the delicate coating of the stomach. . . . Such is the food that is commonly served upon fashionable tables, and given to the children. Its effect is to cause nervousness, and to create thirst which water does not quench. . . . Food should be prepared in as simple a manner as possible, free from condiments and spices, and even from an undue amount of salt.",
