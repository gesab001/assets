    "word": "Let us open our hearts to Jesus with all the simplicity that a child would tell its earthly parents his perplexities and the things that trouble him. Tell him you are not to listen to evil speaking, to hurt others. Thus we can restrain evil not only in ourselves but in others. Practice consecration to God daily; then there will be no danger in the life of service to God. We want gratitude brought into our life, words, and works.",
