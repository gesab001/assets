    "word": "I remember reading of a young man who felt that he must go and speak of Jesus to the crowds in the street. Some said to him, \"They will abuse you.\" \n\n\n                                -287- \n\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"they abused my Lord, and I can suffer no more than He did.\" So he spoke to the people. They did abuse him. They cast eggs at him. The eggs broke in his face and on his clothes. He took out his handkerchief and wiped them off, and continued to speak. He did not retaliate in any way. They soon found that they could not stop him by abuse, and so they let him alone. That man's work resulted in the conversion of hundreds, because he would never allow himself to be annoyed. Some of the very ones who were his bitterest opposers at first were converted and united with him.",
