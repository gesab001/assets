    "word": "This rule should be sacredly observed toward the dullest, the youngest, and the most blundering scholars. What God will do with these apparently uninteresting youth, you do not know. God has accepted and chosen in the past just such specimens to do a great work for Him. His Spirit acting upon the heart has operated like an electric battery, arousing the apparently benumbed faculties to vigorous and persevering action. The Lord saw in these rough, uninteresting, unhewn stones precious metal that will endure the test of storm and tempest and the fiery ordeal of heat. God seeth not as man seeth; God judgeth not as man judgeth. He searcheth the heart. He judgeth not from appearance, but judgeth righteously.",
