    "word": "My message is that the restaurants are carrying a burden that the Lord has not laid upon them. The preparations of food are so expensive that the poorer class receive but little benefit. There should be greater simplicity in the preparation of foods. The living testimony of truth should be borne, and a reformation should take place. Too much talent and capability are absorbed in a work which reveals but few results in the salvation of souls.-- Letter 269, 1905, pp. 2, 3. ( To S. N. Haskell, G. I. Butler, and I. A. Ford, September 15, 1905.)",
