{"word": "An Impoverished Diet Discredits Health Reform \n\n                                             Letter 135, 1902 \n     139. Some of our people conscientiously abstain from eating improper food, and at the same time neglect to eat the food that would supply the elements necessary for the proper sustenance of the body. Let us never bear testimony against health reform by failing to use wholesome, palatable food in place of the harmful articles of diet that we have discarded. Much tact and discretion should be employed in preparing nourishing food to take the place of that which has constituted the diet of many families. This effort requires faith in God, earnestness of purpose, and a willingness to help one another. A diet lacking in the proper elements of nutrition brings reproach upon the cause of health reform. We are mortal, and must supply ourselves with food that will give proper sustenance to the body. \n     [AN IMPOVERISHED DIET NOT RECOMMENDED--315, 317, 318, 388] \n     [AN IMPOVERISHED DIET THE RESULT OF EXTREME VIEWS--316] \n     [GUARDING AGAINST IMPOVERISHED DIET WHEN DISCARDING FLESH MEAT--320, 816] \n                                                                           93", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 92}
