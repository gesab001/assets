{"word": "\"CHRIST CRUCIFIED, CHRIST RISEN, CHRIST ASCENDED INTO THE HEAVENS, CHRIST COMING AGAIN, SHOULD SO SOFTEN, GLADDEN, AND FILL THE MIND OF THE MINISTER THAT HE WILL PRESENT THESE TRUTHS TO THE PEOPLE IN LOVE AND DEEP EARNESTNESS. THE MINISTER WILL THEN BE LOST SIGHT OF, AND JESUS WILL BE MADE MANIFEST. LIFT UP JESUS, YOU THAT TEACH THE PEOPLE, LIFT HIM UP IN SERMON, IN SONG, IN PRAYER. LET ALL YOUR POWERS BE DIRECTED TO POINTING SOULS, CONFUSED, BEWILDERED, LOST, TO THE 'LAMB OF GOD.' LIFT HIM UP, THE RISEN SAVIOUR, AND SAY TO ALL WHO HEAR, COME TO HIM WHO 'HATH LOVED US, AND HATH GIVEN HIMSELF FOR US.' LET THE SCIENCE OF SALVATION BE THE BURDEN OF EVERY SERMON, THE THEME OF EVERY SONG. LET IT BE POURED FORTH IN EVERY SUPPLICATION. BRING NOTHING INTO YOUR PREACHING TO SUPPLEMENT CHRIST, THE WISDOM AND POWER OF GOD. HOLD FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE, PRESENTING JESUS AS THE HOPE OF THE PENITENT AND THE STRONGHOLD OF EVERY BELIEVER. REVEAL THE WAY OF PEACE TO THE TROUBLED AND THE DESPONDENT, AND SHOW FORTH THE GRACE AND COMPLETENESS OF THE SAVIOUR.\"--\"GOSPEL WORKERS,\" PP. 159, 160.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 247}
