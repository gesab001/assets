{"word": "The Bible is the standard by which to test the claims of all who profess sanctification. Jesus prayed that His disciples might be sanctified through the truth, and He says, \"Thy word is truth\" (John 17:17); while the psalmist declares, \"Thy law is the truth\" (Psalm 119:142). All whom God is leading will manifest a high regard for the Scriptures in which His voice is heard. The Bible will be to them \"profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works\" (2 Timothy 3:16). \"Ye shall know them by their fruits\" (Matthew 7:16).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 51}
