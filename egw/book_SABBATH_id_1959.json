{"word": "\"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel,  saying, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.\" \"Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.\" Has Satan succeeded in removing the sanctity from the day thus distinguished above all others? He has succeeded in putting another day in its stead, but never can he take from it the blessing of the Lord. \"Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.\" What can be more positive and clear than these words? And has God changed? He will remain the same through all eternity, but man \"has sought out many inventions.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 153}
