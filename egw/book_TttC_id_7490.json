    "word": "\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.\" Those who do this will meet with no loss. The treasure laid up in heaven is secure; and it is put to our account, for Jesus said: \"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.\" Men may sow here, but they reap in eternity.",
