{"word": "Selfishness Contracts the Intellect.--Selfish interest must ever be made subordinate; for if given room to act, it becomes a controlling power which contracts the intellect, hardens the heart, and weakens the moral power. Then disappointment comes. The man has divorced himself from God and sold himself to unworthy pursuits. He cannot be happy, for he cannot respect himself. He has lowered himself in his own estimation. He is an intellectual failure.--MS 21, 1899.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 271}
