    "word": "Brother D B overtaxed his strength last season while laboring in new fields with the tent without suitable help. God does not require this brother, or any of His servants, to injure their health by exposure and taxing labor. The brethren at ----- should have felt an interest that would have been shown by their works. They could have secured help if they had been awake to the interest of the cause of God and felt the worth of souls. While Brother D B felt a deep sense of the work of God and the value of souls, which called for continual effort, a large church at ----- by their petty difficulties \n                                                                           129\nheld Brother A B from helping his brother. These brothers should come up with renewed courage, shake themselves from the trials and discouragements which have held them at ----- and crippled their testimony, and should claim strength from the Mighty One. They should have borne a plain, free testimony to Brother X and Y, and urged the truth home, and done what they could to have these men make a proper distribution of their property. Brother A B, in taking so many burdens, is lessening his mental and physical strength.",
