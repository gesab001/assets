{"word": "Encourage the Learners \n\n     It is a religious duty for every Christian girl and woman to learn at once to make good, sweet, light bread from unbolted wheat flour. Mothers should take their daughters into the kitchen with them when very young, and teach them the art of cooking. The mother cannot expect her daughters to understand the mysteries of housekeeping without education. She should instruct them patiently, lovingly, and make the work as agreeable as she can by her cheerful countenance and encouraging words of approval. If they fail once, twice, or thrice, censure not. Already discouragement is doing its work, and tempting them to say, \"It is of no use; I can't do it.\" This is not the time for censure. The will is becoming weakened. It needs the spur of encouraging, cheerful, hopeful words, as, \"Never mind the mistakes you have made. You are but a learner, and must expect to make blunders. Try again. Put your mind on what you are doing. Be very careful, and you will certainly succeed.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 262}
