{"word": "If you are Bible Christians, each will have as great an interest for his brother workman as for himself. The work of giving the bread of life to souls that are ready to perish, should be all absorbing, keeping the hearts of the workers kind and tender to one another. True Christian courtesy needs to be cultivated, the mind and heart must be educated and trained by deeds of kindness to have an unselfish interest in every laborer in the work.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 365}
