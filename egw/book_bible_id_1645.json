{"word": "The \\93great city\\94 in whose streets the witnesses are slain, and where their dead bodies lie, \\93is spiritually Egypt.\\94 Of all nations presented in Bible history, Egypt most boldly denied the existence of the living God, and resisted his commands. No monarch ever ventured upon more open and high-handed rebellion against the authority of Heaven than did the king of Egypt. When the message was brought him by Moses, in the name of the Lord, Pharaoh proudly answered, \\93Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.\\94 [Exodus 5:2.] This is atheism; and the nation represented by Egypt would give voice to a similar denial of the claims of the living God, and would manifest a like spirit of unbelief and defiance. The \\93great city\\94 is also compared, \\93spiritually,\\94 to Sodom. The corruption of Sodom in breaking the law of God was especially manifested in licentiousness. And this sin was also to be a pre-eminent characteristic of the nation that should fulfill the specifications of this scripture.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 269}
