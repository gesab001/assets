{"word": "Jesus is more precious to the soul that beholds Him by the eye of faith than is anything else beside, and the believing soul is more precious to Jesus than fine gold of Ophir. Christ looks upon His hands--the marks of the crucifixion are there--and He says, \"I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me\" (Isaiah 49:16). The Christian is walled in by the rich full promises of an infinite God.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 61}
