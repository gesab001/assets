{"word": "The priests and the Pharisees also were annoyed because this Child would not accept their human inventions, maxims, and traditions. . . .Failing to convince Him that He ought to look upon human traditions as sacred, they came to Joseph and Mary and complained that Jesus was taking a wrong course in regard to their customs and traditions. Jesus knew what it was to have His family divided against Him on account of His religious faith. He loved peace; He craved the love and confidence of the members of His family; but He knew what it was to have them withdraw their affection from Him. He suffered rebuke and censure because He took a straightforward course and would not do evil because others did evil, but was true to the commandments of Jehovah. . . .", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 228}
