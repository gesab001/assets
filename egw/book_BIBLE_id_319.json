{"word": "The religion of the Bible is not to be confined between the covers of a book, nor within the walls of a church. It is not to be brought out occasionally for our own benefit, and then to be carefully laid aside again. It is to sanctify the daily life, to manifest itself in every business transaction and in all our social relations.--The Desire of Ages, pp. 306, 307.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 26}
