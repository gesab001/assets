{"word": "Wake up, brethren and sisters, wake up. Sleep no longer. \"Why stand ye here all the day idle?\" Jesus calls you, saying, \"Go work today in My vineyard.\" Whoever has received the Holy Spirit, will make it manifest; for all his powers will be employed in the most active service. All who actually receive Christ by faith, work. They feel the burden of souls. God now calls upon every one who has a knowledge of the truth, who is a depositary of sacred truth, to arise and impart the light of heaven to others.--Review and Herald, Dec. 6, 1893.", "paragraph": 11, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 80}
