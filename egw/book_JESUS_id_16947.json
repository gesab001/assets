{"word": "I would call your attention to the precious promises in the Word of God. All who are children of God have not the same powers, the same temperaments, the same confidence and boldness. I am glad indeed that our feelings are no evidence that we are not children of God. The enemy will tempt you to think that you have done things that have separated you from God and that He no longer loves you, but our Lord loves us still, and we may know by the words He has placed on record for just such cases as yours. \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous\" (1 John 2:1). \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9). . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 285}
