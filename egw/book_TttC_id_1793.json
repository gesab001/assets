    "word": "I have heard many excuse themselves from inviting to their homes and hearts the saints of God. \"Why, I have nothing prepared, I have nothing cooked; they must go to some other place.\" And at that place there may be some other excuse invented for not receiving those who need hospitality, and the feelings of the visitors are deeply grieved, and they leave with unpleasant impressions in regard to the hospitality of these professed brethren and sisters. If you have no bread, sister, imitate the case brought to view in the Bible. Go to your neighbor and say: \"Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to \n                                                                           29\nset before him.\" We have not an example of this lack of bread ever being made an excuse to refuse entrance to an applicant. When Elijah came to the widow of Sarepta, she shared her morsel with the prophet of God, and he wrought a miracle, and caused that in that act of making a home for his servant, and sharing her morsel with him, she herself was sustained, and her life and that of her son preserved. Thus will it prove in the case of many, if they do this cheerfully, for the glory of God.",
