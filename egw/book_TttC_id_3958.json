    "word": "Some will not receive the testimony that God has given us to bear, flattering themselves that we may be deceived and that they may be right. They think that the people of God are not in need of plain dealing and of reproof, but that God is with them. These tempted ones, whose souls have ever been at war with the faithful reproving of sin, would cry: Speak unto us smooth things. What disposition will these make of the message of the True Witness to the Laodiceans? There can be no deception here. This message must be borne to a lukewarm church by God's servants. It must arouse His people from their security and dangerous deception in regard to their real standing before God. This testimony, if received, will arouse to action and lead to self-abasement and confession of sins. The True Witness says: \"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.\" And again, \"As many as I love, I rebuke \n                                                                           260\nand chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.\" Then comes the promise: \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.\" \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.\"",
