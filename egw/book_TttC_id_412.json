    "word": "Said Jesus: \"Love one another, as I have loved you.\" How much? His love cannot be told. He left the glory that He had with the Father before the world was. \"He was wounded \n                                                                           151\nfor our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.\" He patiently bore every indignity and scorn. Behold His agony in the garden, when He prayed that the cup might pass from Him! Behold His sufferings on Calvary! All this for guilty, lost man. And Jesus says: \"Love one another, as I have loved you.\" How much? Well enough to give your life for a brother. But has it come to this, that self must be gratified, and the word of God neglected? The world is their God. They serve it, they love it, and the love of God has departed. If ye love the world, the love of the Father is not in you.",
