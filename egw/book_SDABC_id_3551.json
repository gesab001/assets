    "word": "(Psalm 119:126, 127; Malachi 3:18.) It Is Time to Fight!--Let no one yield to temptation and become less fervent in his attachment to God's law because of the contempt placed upon it; for that is the very thing that should make us pray with all our heart and soul and voice, \"It is time for thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law.\" Therefore, because of the universal contempt, I will not turn traitor when God will be most glorified and most honored by my loyalty.",
