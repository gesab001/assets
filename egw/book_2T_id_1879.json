God calls for a living sacrifice. The body, He tells us, is the temple of the Holy Ghost, the habitation of His Spirit, and He requires all who bear His image to take care of their bodies for the purpose of His service and His glory. \"Ye are not your own,\" says the inspired apostle, \"ye are bought with a price;\" wherefore \"glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" In order to do this, add to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience.
