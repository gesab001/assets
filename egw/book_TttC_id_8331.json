    "word": "Jesus and His love should be interwoven with all the education given, as the very best knowledge the students can have. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" If the principal, in his ambitious projects, soars away from the Source of all wisdom and thinks that Bible religion will clip his wings, he will find that he amounts to no more than a soap bubble. Then for your soul's sake bring the Prince of life into every plan, every organization. You cannot have too much of Jesus or of Scripture history in your school.",
