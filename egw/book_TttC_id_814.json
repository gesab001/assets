    "word": "Your influence in ----- has been injurious. You were opposed to organization, and preached against it in an indefinite manner, not so boldly as some might have done, but you went just as far as you dared to go. In this way you have many times gratified your envious feelings, and created distrust and uncertainty in the minds of many, when if you had come out openly, you would have been plainly understood and could have done but little mischief. When charged with advocating sentiments contrary to the faith of the body, you would not acknowledge it, but mystified your position, and made it appear that the brethren misunderstood you, when you know that the charge was correct. As you now are, the church cannot depend on you. When you manifest the fruits of an entire reform, and give evidence that you are converted, and have overcome your jealousy, then God will again trust His flock to your care. But until you make thorough restitution, you will exert the best influence by staying at home, and being \"not slothful in business.\"",
