    "word": "Beholding Christ for the purpose of becoming like Him, the seeker after truth sees the perfection of the principles of God\u2019s law, and he becomes dissatisfied with everything but perfection. . . . A battle must be fought with the attributes that Satan has been strengthening for his own use. . . . But he knows that with the Redeemer there is saving power that will gain for him the victory in the conflict. The Saviour will strengthen and help him as he comes pleading for grace and efficiency.",
