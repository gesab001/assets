    "word": "MR No. 845 - The Conflict Between Jezebel and the Sons of the Prophets\n\n     A correct education had been given them [the sons of the prophets] in regard to the living God. The past history of the people of God, the fall of Adam and Eve through transgression, the preaching of Noah, the extended probation of 120 years, and the final destruction of the old world by a flood was known to them. The crime and violence of the antediluvians, their repeated rejection of the messages sent, wore out the long-suffering patience of God, and these despisers of His mercy were made to drink the waters of the flood. The children of Israel were instructed in the Word of God, that they might prepare for the advent of Christ.",
