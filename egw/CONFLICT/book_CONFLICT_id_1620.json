    "word": "The great General of armies will lead in every battle for the advancement of His cause. He will be the guide of His people in the perilous conflicts in which they have to engage, if the under leaders and undershepherds will do their appointed work, and listen to the voice which says: \"This is the way, walk ye in it;\" \"He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness.\" What a great comfort this promise should be to us! We may walk in the light as He is in the light.",
