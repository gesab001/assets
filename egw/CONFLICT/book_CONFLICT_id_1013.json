    "word": "51\nPRAYER WILL BRING POWER TO OVERCOME.\u2014We must have on the whole armor of God and be ready at any moment for a conflict with the powers of darkness. When temptations and trials rush in upon us, let us go to God and agonize with Him in prayer. He will not turn us away empty, but will give us grace and strength to overcome, and to break the power of the enemy.\u2014(Early Writings, 46.)",
