    "word": "St. Helena Sanitarium, California, August 2, 1907 \n\n     I am deeply grateful to our heavenly Father that I am improving healthwise. I need so much the grace of God every moment of my time. We are certainly now in the last conflict of this earth's history, and the signs of the Lord's coming, as Christ specified, are so common we scarcely consider the outcome. I am constantly pleading with the Lord to arouse His people to a vivid sense of the times which He has assured us would be just previous to the coming of our Lord.",
