    "word": "Christ has given us no assurance that to attain perfection of character is an easy matter. It is a conflict, a battle, a march, day after day. All who reach the standard must learn the lesson that it is through much tribulation that we enter the kingdom of heaven. If we sit with Christ on His throne, we must be partakers with Him of His suffering. \"It became Him . . .  in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of our salvation perfect through suffering\" (Hebrews 2:10). \"Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered\" (Hebrews 5:8). Shall we then be timid and cowardly because of the trials we meet as we advance? Shall we not meet them without repining and complaints? . . .",
