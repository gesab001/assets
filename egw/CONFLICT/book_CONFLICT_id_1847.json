    "word": "Let us not feel that we have heavy trials to bear, severe conflicts to endure, in representing unpopular truth. Think of Jesus and what he has suffered for you, and be silent. Make no complaint, speak no word of murmuring, let no thought of reproach or discontent enter your mind, even when abused and falsely accused.",
