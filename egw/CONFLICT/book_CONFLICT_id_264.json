    "word": "(1890) C.T.B.H.16\n     240. Christ began the work of redemption just where the ruin began. His first test was on the same point where Adam failed. It was through temptations addressed to the appetite that Satan had overcome a large proportion of the human race, and his success had made him feel that the control of this fallen planet was in his hands. But in Christ he found one who was able to resist him, and he left the field of battle a conquered foe. Jesus says, \"He hath nothing in Me.\" His victory is an assurance that we too may come off victors in our conflicts with the enemy. But it is not our heavenly Father's purpose to save us without an effort on our part to cooperate with Christ. We must act our part, and divine power, uniting with our effort, will bring victory. \n     [FOR OUR SAKES CHRIST EXERCISED SELF-CONTROL STRONGER THAN HUNGER OR DEATH--295] \n     [CHRIST STRENGTHENED TO ENDURE BY HIS FAST; HIS VICTORY AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO ALL--296] \n                                                                           154\n\n     [WHEN MOST FIERCELY TEMPTED, CHRIST ATE NOTHING--70] \n     [THE STRENGTH OF TEMPTATION TO INDULGE APPETITE MEASURED BY ANGUISH OF CHRIST DURING HIS FAST--298]",
