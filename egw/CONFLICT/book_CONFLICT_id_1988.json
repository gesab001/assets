    "word": "There are only two parties upon the earth--those who stand under the blood-stained banner of Jesus Christ and those who stand under the black banner of rebellion. Those who stand under Christ's banner bear the sign of obedience spoken of in Exodus 31:12-18. Please read this Scripture carefully. In the twelfth chapter of Revelation is represented the last great conflict between the obedient and the disobedient. [Revelation 12:17;  13:11-17, quoted].",
