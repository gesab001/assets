    "word": "What men may say, what their opinion of us may be, amounts to very little. The question that concerns us is, What is God's measurement of my character? . . . He who sustains another man in a wrong course of action is not on God's side, but on the enemy's. \"So did not I,\" Nehemiah says, \"because of the fear of God\" (Nehemiah 5:15). Every soul is to gird himself for the spiritual conflict before us. The world's plans, the world's customs, the world's conniving, are not for us. We are to say, \"So did not I, because of the fear of God.\" Selfishness, dishonesty, craftiness, are trying to intrude into hearts. Let us not give them room.",
