    "word": "Paul writes to the Romans, \u201cIf it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.\u201d But there is a point beyond which it is impossible to maintain union and harmony without the sacrifice of principle. Separation then becomes an absolute duty. The laws of nations should be respected when they do not conflict with the laws of God. But when there is collision between them, every true disciple of Christ will say, as did the apostle Peter when commanded to speak no more in the name of Jesus, \u201cWe ought to obey God rather than men.\u201dManuscript 51, 1899 (see also Signs of the Times, Nov. 8, 1899).",
