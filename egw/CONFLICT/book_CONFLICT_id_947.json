    "word": "During the night a very impressive scene passed before me. There seemed to be great confusion and the conflict of armies. A messenger from\n334\nthe Lord stood before me, and said, \u201cCall your household. I will lead you; follow me.\u201d He led me down a dark passage, through a forest, then through the clefts of mountains, and said, \u201cHere you are safe.\u201d There were others who had been led to this retreat. The heavenly messenger said. \u201cThe time of trouble has come as a thief in the night, as the Lord warned you it would come.\u201d",
