    "word": "Christ yielded not to the torturing foe, even in his bitterest anguish. Legions of evil angels were all about\n203\nHim; yet the holy angels were bidden not to break their ranks, and engage in conflict with the taunting, railing adversary, nor were they permitted to minister to the anguished spirit of the divine Sufferer.
