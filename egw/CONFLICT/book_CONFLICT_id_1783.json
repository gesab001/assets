    "word": "Let every man die to self. Let every man be converted. The whole manhood must be brought into the conflict for the victory over self. Obedience to Christ in heart, in mind, in soul, in strength, is now required. Obedience to all the commandments of God is our only assurance of success. I urge upon every one the necessity of learning of Christ. In every movement that is made, take heed how you hear and how you speak. There must be no unfitness in any soul who tries to win eternal life.",
