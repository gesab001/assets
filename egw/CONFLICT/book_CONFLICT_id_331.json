THE LETTERS, LIKE OTHERS WRITTEN BY JAMES AND ELLEN WHITE, WERE WRITTEN WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE PUBLISHED SOMEDAY. BUT IN THESE LETTERS WE GAIN UNCOMMON INSIGHTS INTO HOW COMMITTED CHRISTIANS HANDLED MARITAL STRESS. THROUGH THESE LETTERS WE BELIEVE THAT OTHER COUPLES CAN TAKE HEART AND LEARN HOW TO HANDLE THEIR OWN TENSIONS AND CONFLICTS.",
