    "word": "MR No. 211a - Seek for Unity\n\n     I have felt pained to see differences appear in the Review and Herald, publishing to the world the want of unity among Seventh-day Adventists. It is essential that we present a united front. The light given me for many years from the Lord has been, Let not conflicting sentiments be published in our church paper. . . . This is no time for dissension; press together; seek to be a unit.--Letter 16j, 1892, p. 1, 3. (To A. T. Jones, September 2, 1892.)",
