    "word": "The field is the world. The light of truth must be borne amid the moral darkness. It is not a message which we need cringe to declare. No one who works for the Master is to cover it, that it shall not reveal its origin and its purpose. It must move on triumphantly, elevating, ennobling, and purifying everything it touches and giving dignity to all who come under its influence. Its agents must be men who will not hold their peace day or night, for it involves the mightiest conflicts. The results touch both worlds, link earth to heaven, invest men with its own exalted character. The cross--the cross of Christ--is lifted up and stands prominent, infusing into the message a new vigor. Its power is seen and its efficacy comprehended, showing the greatness of the authority of the sin-pardoning Saviour in the heart of the broken law. His power to forgive sins is high and broad and deep. It is without limit. \n                                                                           941",
