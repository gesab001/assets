    "word": "11. Many of you do not feel the need of a daily and hourly connection with Christ. You do not feel the need of prayer, that you may draw from Christ that which is essential for the maintenance of spiritual life. You have failed to appreciate the privilege of associating together in the capacity of believers. You are not to come together simply as a matter of form and ceremony, but for the interchange of thought, for the relation of your daily experiences, for the expression of thanksgiving, for the utterance of your sincere desire for divine enlightenment, that you may know God and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. Communing together in regard to Christ will strengthen the soul for the conflicts and trials that will come upon you. Never entertain the idea that you can be Christians and still withdraw yourselves within yourselves. Each one is a part of the great web of humanity, and the nature and quality of your experience will be largely determined by the character of the experience of those with whom you associate. Jesus says, \"Where two or three are met together in my name, there am I in the midst.\" Then do not forsake the assembling of yourselves \"together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.\"",
