    "word": "The words from heaven, \u201cThis is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,\u201d were still sounding in the ears of Satan. But he was determined to make Christ disbelieve this testimony. The word of God was Christ\u2019s assurance of His divine mission. . . . It was Satan\u2019s purpose to make Him doubt this word. If Christ\u2019s confidence in God could be shaken, Satan knew that victory in the whole conflict would be his. He could overcome Jesus. He hoped that under the force of despondency and extreme hunger, Christ would lose faith in His Father and work a miracle in His own behalf. Had He done this, the plan of salvation would have been broken.",
