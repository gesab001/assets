    "word": "Christ prayed for His disciples, [John 17:17-23, quoted]. God has expressed His will in this prayer of Christ for the unity of His believing people. But there is an unwearied conflict kept up upon this earth, polluted and marred with the curse. Satan works to make the prayer of Christ of none effect. He makes continual efforts to create bitterness and discord; for where there is unity there is strength, a oneness which all the powers of hell cannot break. And all who shall aid the enemies of God by bringing weakness and sorrow and discouragement upon any of God's people, through their own perverse ways and tempers, are working directly against the prayer of Christ.",
