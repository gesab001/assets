The redeemed only, of all created beings, have in their own experience known the actual conflict with sin; they have wrought with Christ, and, as even the angels could not do, have entered\n298\ninto the fellowship of His sufferings; will they have no testimony as to the science of redemption\u2014nothing that will be of worth to unfallen beings?\u2014Ed 308.",
