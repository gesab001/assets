    "word": "In meeting the enemy in the wilderness, Christ's response to his wicked insinuations was, \"It is written.\" When Satan presumed to claim the ownership of the whole world, and asked Christ to worship him as God, He who with a word might have called to His assistance legions of angels, merely said, \"Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve\" (Matthew 4:10). The intensity of this conflict we but partly understand. It seemed as though the Saviour would die on the field of battle, but He withstood the wily foe. His words so carefully chosen, were as sharp as a two-edged sword. Satan was thoroughly repulsed. He realized that the Prince of Life could not be deceived by any sophistry.",
