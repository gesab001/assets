    "word": "We have absolute need of the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit. We have no time to confer with flesh and blood. The power of Satan is apparently in the supremacy, he is seeking to convert all things in the world to his own purpose, to imbue human beings with his own spirit and nature. The conflict will be terrible. The minds and hearts of men seem surcharged with hostility against divine revelation; the passions are stirred with envy against purity and holiness and devotion to God and his requirements; the will is set like granite against all that is called God or that is worshiped. The confederacy of Satanic agencies, united with evil men, are as instruments of unrighteousness, throwing their whole force into the battlefield, evil against good.",
