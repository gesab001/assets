    "word": "We let self arise. We want to put the trials in their right place, and where is it? Christ says to everyone that is weary and heavy laden, \"Come unto me.\" And what? \"Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" And notwithstanding the crush of conflict that we shall have to pass through if we accept the truth of heavenly origin, there is meekness and lowliness in every move. Hide in Jesus Christ. Our life and character is hid with Christ in God, so we cannot afford to let any impulse of passion control our words or control our actions, but we must keep the Saviour's example ever before us, and we must do just as Jesus would have done under similar circumstances. We are not to be revengeful.",
