    "word": "When summoned to Augsburg to answer for his faith, he obeyed the summons. That one lone man who had stirred the rage of priests and people was arraigned before those who had caused the world to tremble,\u2014a meek lamb surrounded by angry lions; yet for the sake of Christ and the truth, he stood up undaunted, and with holy eloquence, which the truth alone can inspire, he gave the reasons of his faith. His enemies tried by various means to silence the bold advocate for truth. At first they flattered him, and held out the promise that he should be exalted and honored. But life and honors were valueless to him, if purchased at the sacrifice of the truth. Brighter and clearer shone \n59\nthe word of God upon his understanding, giving him a more vivid sense of the errors, corruptions, and hypocrisy of the papacy. His enemies then sought to intimidate him, and cause him to renounce his faith; but he boldly stood in defense of the truth. He was ready to die for his faith, if God required; but to yield it\u2014never! God preserved his life. He bade angels attend him, and baffle the rage and purposes of his enemies, and bring him unharmed through the stormy conflict.",
