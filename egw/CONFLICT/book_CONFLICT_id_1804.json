    "word": "2Red - Redemption; or the Temptation of Christ in The Wilderness (1877)\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n     PROBABLY THERE IS NO SUBJECT IN ALL THE RANGE OF CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY THAT IS MORE NEGLECTED, AND YET MORE IMPORTANT, THAN THE THREE-FOLD TEMPTATION OF CHRIST IN THE WILDERNESS. HENCE, THIS LITTLE WORK FILLS A PLACE THAT NO OTHER DOES. THE PLAIN AND EARNEST STYLE OF THE WRITER, HER PRACTICAL APPEALS TOUCHING CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE, AND HER EXALTED VIEWS OF THE GREAT WORK OF THE REDEEMER IN CARRYING OUT THE PLAN OF SALVATION, MAKE THE WORK ONE OF INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE. MAY IT BE CAREFULLY READ, AND PROVE A PRECIOUS BLESSING TO THE CANDID READER.\n                                            PUBLISHERS.\n\n                        The Temptation of Christ\n\n     After the baptism of Jesus in Jordan, he was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil. When he had come up out of the water, he bowed upon Jordan's banks, and plead with the great Eternal for strength to endure the conflict with the fallen foe. The opening of the heavens and the descent of the excellent glory attested his divine character. The voice from the Father declared the close relation of Christ to his Infinite Majesty: \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" The mission of Christ was soon to begin. But he must first withdraw from the busy scenes of life to a desolate wilderness for the express purpose of bearing the three-fold test of temptation in behalf of those he had come to redeem.",
