    "word": "From the first, some in Christiania have bargained that they will come so far in their faith, and no farther. They only decided to hold with the church and the world, and unless they are converted, when these [the church and the world] separate they will be swept in with the world. With some, business has come first; it has been a mental reservation with them; and when it comes in conflict with the truth, it is more afflicting with them to give up their idol than to retain a wicked heart. Conscience is on the side of the truth, but their hearts are with the world, and Satan makes speedy work with all such, when the test comes. All who venture to choose their own way before God's requirements are on dangerous ground. . . .",
