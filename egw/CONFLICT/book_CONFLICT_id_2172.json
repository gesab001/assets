    "word": "Time is passing into eternity. Many who ought to have keen perceptions are blinded by false theories and false influences. They are unready to meet the last great conflict, and they do not realize their unprepared condition. My prayer for them is: \"O Thou searcher of hearts, let Thy word, which is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, pierce to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. Bring these souls who are in so great peril because of their lack of discernment to realize that they must cope with Satanic powers.\"",
