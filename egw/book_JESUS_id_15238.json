Among the peculiarities which should distinguish God's people from the world in these last days, is their humility and meekness. \"Learn of Me,\" says Christ, \"for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Here is the repose which so many crave and in vain spend time and money to obtain.
