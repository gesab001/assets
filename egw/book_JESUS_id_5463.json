{"word": "Opportunities for Christian Work\n     As wise generalship is needed in the service of Christ as over the battalions of an army that protects the life and liberty of the people. It is not every one who can labor judiciously for the salvation of souls. There is much close thinking to be done. We must not enter into the Lord's work hap-hazard, and expect success. The Lord needs men of mind, men of thought. Jesus calls for co-workers, not blunderers. God wants right thinking and intelligent men to do the great work necessary to the salvation of souls.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 321}
