{"word": "In the beginning God said, \\93Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.\\94 But sin has almost obliterated the moral image of God in human beings. Jesus came down to our world that He might give us a living example, that we might know how to live and how to keep the way of the Lord. He was the image of the Father. His beautiful and spotless character is before us as an example for us to imitate. We must study and copy and follow Jesus Christ, then we shall bring His loveliness and beauty into our character. In doing this we are standing before God through faith, winning back by conflict with the powers of darkness the power of self-control, the love of God that Adam lost.\\97Manuscript 6a, 1886 (Sermons and Talks, vol. 1, pp. 31-34).", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 43}
