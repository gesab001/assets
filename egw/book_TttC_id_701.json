    "word": "The prophecy of Isaiah 3 was presented before me as applying to these last days, and the reproofs are given to the daughters of Zion who have thought only of appearance and display.

They will be brought low in the dust and will long for an experience in the things of God, which they have failed to obtain. \n\n\n          War lifts his helmet to his brow; \n          O God, protect Thy people now. \n\n                                               -",
