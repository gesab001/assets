{"word": "Chapter 5 \n\n     1 (chs 3:19-28; 4:3-5; Galatians 2:16; Hebrews 11:1; see EGW on Galatians 5:6). Faith the Means, Not the End.--Faith is not the ground of our salvation, but it is the great blessing--the eye that sees, the ear that hears, the feet that run, the hand that grasps. It is the means, not the end. If Christ gave His life to save sinners, why shall I not take that blessing? My faith grasps it, and thus my faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things unseen. Thus resting and believing, I have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ (Letter  329a, 1905).", "paragraph": 9, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1073}
