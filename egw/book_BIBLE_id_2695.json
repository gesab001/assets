{"word": "The most valuable rules for social and family intercourse are to be found in the Bible. . . . Our Saviour's sermon on the mount contains instruction of priceless worth to old and young. It should be often read in the family circle, and its precious teachings exemplified in the daily life. The golden rule, \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,\". . . should be made the law of the family. Those who cherish the spirit of Christ will manifest politeness at home. . . . They will be constantly seeking to make all around them happy, forgetting self in their kind attention to others.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 200}
