    "word": "Christ has opened a fountain for the sinful, suffering world, and the voice of divine mercy is heard: \"Come, all ye thirsting souls; come and drink.\" You may take of the water of life freely. Let him that heareth say, Come; and whosoever will, let him come. Let every soul, women as well as men, sound this message. Then the work will be carried to the waste places of the earth. The scripture will be fulfilled: In that day the Lord shall open fountains in the valleys, and \"rivers in the desert,\" and \"with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.\" Isaiah 41:18; 43:19, 20; Isaiah 12:3. \n\n\n                                                (87)",
