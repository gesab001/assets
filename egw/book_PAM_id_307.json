{"word": "Securing Interests\n \n\n     Do not leave until interests have decided, been baptized, and gotten into a church.--For years light has been given upon this point, showing the necessity of following up an interest that has been raised, and in no case leaving it until all have decided that lean toward the truth and have experienced the conversion necessary for baptism and united with some church or formed one themselves.
