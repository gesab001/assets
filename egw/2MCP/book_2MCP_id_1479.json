{"word": "Living for a Purpose Makes One Truly Happy.-- Those who live for a purpose, seeking to benefit and bless their fellowmen and to honor and glorify their Redeemer, are the truly happy ones on the earth, while the man who is restless, discontented, and seeking this and testing that, hoping to find happiness, is always complaining of disappointment. He is always in want, never satisfied, because he lives for himself alone. Let it be your aim to do good, to act your part in life faithfully.-- Lt 17, 1872.
