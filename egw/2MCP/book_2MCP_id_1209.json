{"word": "Stubbornness and Conscientiousness (reflections concerning a self-willed, self-deceived man).--As you read the letters I have sent to Oakland, you will have some idea of the stubbornness of the man and his determination to do as he pleases and to have his own way. He has not heeded the counsels of the Lord but has considered it safe to walk in the sparks of his own kindling.

If he will turn traitor as did _____, he will doubtless do it under a great plea of conscientiousness.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 725}
