{"word": "Each Has Peculiar Trials.--We cannot afford to be in any way a hindrance to others. Each has his own peculiar temptations and trials, and we are to stand in a position where we can help and strengthen the tempted. We are to encourage, and, if possible, lift up those that are weak in the faith. By speaking of the promises of God, we may sometimes remove depression from the minds of those who are in trial and difficulty.--MS 41, 1908.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 435}
