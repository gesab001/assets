{"word": "A Disposition to Cause Pain Is Satanic.--It is because of man's sin that \"the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together\" (Romans 8:22). Suffering and death were thus entailed, not only upon the human race, but upon the animals. Surely, then, it becomes man to seek to lighten, instead of increasing, the weight of suffering which his transgression has brought upon God's creatures. He who will abuse animals because he has them in his power is both a coward and a tyrant.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 514}
