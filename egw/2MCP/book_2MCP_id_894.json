{"word": "Seek to make God your father, and you will never want a friend. You will be exposed to trials; yet be steadfast and strive to adorn your profession. You will need grace to stand, but God's pitying eye is upon you. Pray much and earnestly, believing that God will help you. Guard against irritability and petulance and a spirit of tantalizing. Forbearance is a virtue which you need to encourage. Seek for piety of heart. Be a consistent Christian. Possess a love of purity and humble simplicity, and let these be interwoven with your life.--2T 314 (1869).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 632}
