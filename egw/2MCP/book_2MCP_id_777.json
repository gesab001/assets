{"word": "The Lord will be with you, mothers, as you try to form right habits in your children. But you must begin the training process early, or your future work will be very difficult. Teach them line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little. Bear in mind that your children belong to God and are to become His sons and daughters. He designs that the families on earth shall be samples of the family in heaven.--RH, Dec 5, 1899.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 599}
