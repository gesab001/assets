{"word": "The Holy Spirit Fills the Cleansed Mind.--We need to be constantly filling the mind with Christ and emptying it of selfishness and sin. . . . Just as surely as you empty your mind of vanity and frivolity, the vacuum will be supplied with that which God is waiting to give you--His Holy Spirit. Then out of the good treasure of the heart you will bring forth good things, rich gems of thought, and others will catch the words. . . . Your thoughts and \n\n784 \n\naffections will dwell upon Christ, and you will reflect upon others that which has shone upon you from the Sun of righteousness.--RH, Mar 15, 1892.
