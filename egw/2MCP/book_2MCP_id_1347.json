{"word": "To deal with minds is the nicest work in which men ever engaged. All are not fitted to correct the erring. They have not wisdom to deal justly, while loving mercy. They are not inclined to see the necessity of mingling love and tender compassion with faithful reproofs. Some are ever needlessly severe and do not feel the necessity of the injunction of the apostle: \"And of some have compassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire\" (Jude 22, 23).--3T 269, 270 (1873).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 769}
