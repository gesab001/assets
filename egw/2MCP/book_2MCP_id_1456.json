{"word": "God Gives Talents, Man Cultivates the Mind.--We are to cultivate the talents given us by God. They are His gifts and are to be used in their right relation to each other so as to make a perfect whole. God gives the talents, the powers of the mind; man makes the character. The mind is the Lord's garden, and man must cultivate it earnestly in order to form a character after the divine similitude.--Lt 73, 1899. (HC 106)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 800}
