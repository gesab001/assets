{"word": "Effect of Tea, Coffee, and Other Popular Beverages. --Tea acts as a stimulant and, to a certain extent, \n\n590 \n\nproduces intoxication. The action of coffee and many other popular drinks is similar. The first effect is exhilarating. The nerves of the stomach are excited; these convey irritation to the brain, and this in turn is aroused to impart increased action to the heart and short-lived energy to the entire system. Fatigue is forgotten; the strength seems to be increased. The intellect is aroused, the imagination becomes more vivid.--MH 326 (1905).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 589}
