{"word": "Not Hidden From Jesus Christ.--What a wonderful thought it is that Jesus knows all about the pains and griefs we bear. In all our afflictions He was afflicted. Some among our friends know nothing of human woe or physical pain. They are never sick, and therefore they cannot enter fully into the feelings of those who are sick. But Jesus is touched with the feeling of our infirmity.-- MS 19, 1892. (2SM 237.)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 512}
