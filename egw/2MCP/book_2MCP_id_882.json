{"word": "Not to Be Governed by Human Standards.--I am constantly presenting the need of every man doing his best as a Christian, of training himself to realize the growth, the expansion of mind, the nobility of character, which it is possible for each to have. In all that we do we are to sustain a Christlike relation to one another. We are to use every spiritual force for the carrying out of wise plans in earnest action. The gifts of God are to be used for the saving of souls. Our relations to one another are not to be governed by human standards but by divine love, the love expressed in the gift of God to our world.--CT 256 (1913).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 628}
