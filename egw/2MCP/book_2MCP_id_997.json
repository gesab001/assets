{"word": "Mind to Be Trained.--The mind is the best possession we have; but it must be trained by study, by reflection, by learning in the school of Christ, the best and truest educator the world has ever known. The Christian worker must grow. He must build up a character for usefulness; he must educate himself to endure hardness and to be wise to plan and execute in the work of God. He must be a man of pure mind and conversation--one who will abstain from every appearance of evil and give no occasion for reproach through his heedless ways. He \n\n666 \n\nmust be truthful at heart; in his mouth there must be no guile.--RH, Jan 6, 1885.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 665}
