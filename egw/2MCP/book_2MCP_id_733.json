{"word": "Duty to Control Imagination.--Few realize that it is a duty to exercise control over the thoughts and imaginations. It is difficult to keep the undisciplined mind fixed upon profitable subjects. But if the thoughts are not properly employed, religion cannot flourish in the soul. \n\n588 \n\nThe mind must be preoccupied with sacred and eternal things, or it will cherish trifling and superficial thoughts. Both the intellectual and the moral powers must be disciplined, and they will strengthen and improve by exercise.--CT 544 (1913).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 587}
