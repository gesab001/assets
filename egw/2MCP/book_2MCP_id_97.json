{"word": "The condition of your mind leads to indolence and to a dread of exercise, when this exercise would prove one of the greatest means of your recovery. You will never recover unless you lay aside this listless, dreamy condition of mind and arouse yourself to do, to work while the day lasts. Do, as well as imagine and plan. Turn your mind away from romantic projects. You mingle with your religion a romantic, lovesick sentimentalism, which does not elevate, but only lowers. It is not you alone who is affected; others are injured by your example and influence.--2T 248, 249 (1869).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 398}
