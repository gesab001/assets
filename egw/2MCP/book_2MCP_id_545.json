{"word": "The Heart That Gives Love for Hatred.--It is not earthly rank, nor birth, nor nationality, nor religious \n\n530 \n\nprivilege, which proves that we are members of the family of God; it is love, a love that embraces all humanity. Even sinners whose hearts are not utterly closed to God's Spirit will respond to kindness; while they may give hate for hate, they will also give love for love. But it is only the Spirit of God that gives love for hatred. To be kind to the unthankful and to the evil, to do good hoping for nothing again, is the insignia of the royalty of heaven, the sure token by which the children of the Highest reveal their high estate.--MB 75 (1896).", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 529}
