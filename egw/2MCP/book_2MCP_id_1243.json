{"word": "We must study to discipline ourselves carefully, refusing to do that which would weaken the physical, mental, and moral strength. You need a clear, patient mind, which will endure all that may arise. You need a strong hold from above. Exercise faith, and leave the results with God. When you have done your best, be of good courage. Believe, believe, and hold fast. The enemy will try to get you to make some move which means defeat, but you cannot afford to do this. You cannot afford to make uncertain movements. You need the influence that you will gain by revealing wisdom and discretion.--Lt 121, 1904.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 735}
