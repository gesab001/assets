{"word": "Chap. 63 - Imagination\n\n\n     Christ Employed the Imagination.--Through the imagination He [Christ] reached the heart. His illustrations were taken from the things of daily life, and although they were simple, they had in them a wonderful depth of meaning. The birds of the air, the lilies of the field, the seed, the shepherd and the sheep--with these objects Christ illustrated immortal truth; and ever afterward, when His hearers chanced to see these things of nature, they recalled His words. Christ's illustrations constantly repeated His lessons.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 587}
