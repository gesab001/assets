{"word": "Tends to Destruction, Not Restoration.--I wish to speak plainly to you. You have entered upon a work which has no place in the work of a Christian physician and which must find no place in our health institutions. Innocent though it may appear, this mind cure, if exercised upon the patients, will in its development be for their destruction, not their restoration. Second Timothy \n\n\n                                                 715 \n\n3 describes persons who accept error, such as one mind exercising complete control over another mind. God forbids any such thing. The mind cure is one of Satan's greatest sciences, and it is important that our physicians see clearly the real character of this science; for through it great temptations will come to them. This science must not be allowed a particle of standing room in our sanitariums.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 714}
