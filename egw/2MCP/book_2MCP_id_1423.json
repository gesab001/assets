{"word": "Special Work of Satan to Cause Dissension.--The neglect to cultivate tender consideration and forbearance for one another has caused dissension, distrust,  faultfinding, and general disunion. God . . . calls upon us to put away this great sin and to strive to answer the prayer of Christ that His disciples may be one, as He is one with the Father. . . .
