{"word": "Well, there is a stem that strikes down to the golden sands beneath and gathers nothing but the purest substance that feeds the lily until it develops into the pure and spotless flower, as we see it. Should not this teach us a lesson? It ought to. It shows that although there is iniquity all around us we should not approach it.

When you see iniquity all around you, it makes you all the more glad that He is your Saviour and we are His children.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 798}
