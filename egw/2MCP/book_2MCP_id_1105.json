{"word": "The Link That Binds With Divine Energy.--We are laborers together with God. This is the Lord's own wise arrangement. The cooperation of the human will and endeavor with divine energy is the link that binds men up with one another and with God. The apostle says, \"We are laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). Man is to work with the facilities God has given him. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,\" He says. \"For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\" (Philippians 2:12, 13).--MS 113, 1898.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 694}
