{"word": "Faith Is Taking God at His Word.--Remember that faith is taking God at His word. The Son of God is preparing a place for you in the mansions above. Let thanksgiving be expressed for this. Do not feel that because you do not always feel uplifted, you are not His child. Take hold with humility and zeal to do the work He asks of you. Appreciate every opportunity to do a work that will make you a blessing to those around you. Let it be your determination to do your part toward making the place where you are a place that God can approve and bless.--Lt 246, 1908.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 639}
