{"word": "There are those who do not feel that it is a religious \n\n408 \n\nduty to discipline the mind to dwell upon cheerful subjects, that they may reflect light rather than darkness and gloom. This class of minds will either be engaged in seeking their own pleasure, in frivolous conversation, laughing and joking, and the mind continually elated with a round of amusements; or they will be depressed, having great trials and mental conflicts, which they think but few have ever experienced or can understand. These persons may profess Christianity, but they deceive their own souls. They have not the genuine article.--HR, Mar, 1872.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 407}
