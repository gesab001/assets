{"word": "No Excuse for Talking Discouragement.--\"The Father ... hath delivered us from the power of darkness\" (Colossians \n\n\n                                                 675 \n\n1:13). If this is true, what excuse then have we for talking discouragement and unbelief and doubt--drawing darkness around us as a mantle? Let us roll back the dark shadow of doubt, casting it aside to be borne by Satan, the originator of all doubt and discouragement. He is seeking to cast his hellish shadow across our pathway. Our faith must penetrate the dark cloud of doubt and unbelief, taking hold of the arm of Christ beyond.--MS 102, 1901.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 674}
