{"word": "Separate From Worldly Customs--As God made known His will to the Hebrew captives, to those who were most separate from the customs and practices of a world lying in wickedness, so will the Lord communicate light from heaven to all who will appreciate a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" To them He will express His mind. Those who are least bound up with worldly ideas, are the most separate from display and vanity and pride and love of promotion, who stand forth as His peculiar people, zealous of good works--to these He will reveal the meaning of His word.--Lt 60, 1898.
