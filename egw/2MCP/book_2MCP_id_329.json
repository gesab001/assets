{"word": "Resting in Christ's Love.--Let us turn from the dusty, heated thoroughfares of life to rest in the shadow of Christ's love. Here we gain strength for conflict. Here we learn how to lessen toil and worry and how to speak and sing to the praise of God. Let the weary and the heavy-laden learn from Christ the lesson of quiet trust. They must sit under His shadow if they would be possessors of His peace and rest.--7T 69, 70 (1902).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 468}
