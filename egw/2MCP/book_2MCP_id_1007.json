{"word": "Relation of Ideas One to Another.--Some minds are more like an old curiosity shop than anything else. Many odd bits and ends of truth have been picked up and stored \n\n668 \n\naway there; but they know not how to present them in a clear, connected manner. It is the relation that these ideas have to one another that gives them value. Every idea and statement should be as closely united as the links in a chain. When a minister throws out a mass of matter before the people for them to pick up and arrange in order, his labors are lost, for there are few who will do it.--RH, Apr 6, 1886.
