{"word": "Each Has a Distinct Individuality.--The gospel deals with individuals. Every human being has a soul to save or to lose. Each has an individuality separate and distinct from all others. Each must be convicted for himself, converted for himself. He must receive the truth, repent, believe, and obey for himself. He must exercise his will for himself. No one can do this work by proxy. No one can submerge his individuality in another's. Each must surrender to God by his own act and the mystery of godliness.--MS 28, 1898.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 423}
