{"word": "Dealing With Varied Dispositions.--The Lord wants us to be sanctified. We shall have to contend with people of varied dispositions, and we should be in a position where we know how to deal with human minds. We must ask Christ to give us words to speak that will be a blessing. And as we thus seek to help others, we shall be blessed ourselves.--MS 41, 1908.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 434}
