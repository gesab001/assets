{"word": "Every Situation Provided For.--We are not to let the future, with its hard problems, its unsatisfying prospects, make our hearts faint, our knees tremble, our hands hang down. \"Let him take hold of My strength,\" says the Mighty One, \"that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make \n\n\n                                                 459 \n\npeace with Me\" (Isaiah 27:5). Those who surrender their lives to His guidance and to His service will never be placed in a position for which He has not made provision. Whatever our situation, if we are doers of His word, we have a Guide to direct our way; whatever our perplexity, we have a sure Counselor; whatever our sorrow, bereavement, or loneliness, we have a sympathizing Friend.-- MH 248, 249 (1905).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 458}
