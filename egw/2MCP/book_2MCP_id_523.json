{"word": "Spirit of Hate Debases.--I was shown Satan as he once was, a happy, exalted angel. Then I was shown him as he now is. He still bears a kingly form. His features are still noble, for he is an angel fallen. But the expression of his countenance is full of anxiety, care, unhappiness, malice, hate, mischief, deceit, and every evil. . . .I saw that he had so long bent himself to evil that every good quality was debased and every evil trait was developed.--EW 152 (1882).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 524}
