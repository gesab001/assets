{"word": "Dispositions May Be Modified.--It is in mercy that the Lord reveals to men their hidden defects. He would have them critically examine the complicated emotions and motives of their own hearts and detect that which is wrong, modify their dispositions, and refine their manners. God would have His servants become acquainted with their own hearts. In order to bring to them a true knowledge of their condition, He permits the fire of affliction to assail them so that they may be purified.--RH, Apr 10, 1894 (ML 92.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 617}
