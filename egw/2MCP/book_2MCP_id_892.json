{"word": "Despondency a Fruit of Excessive Leisure.-- Despondent feelings are frequently the result of too much leisure. The hands and mind should be occupied in useful \n\n632 \n\nlabor, lightening the burdens of others; and those who are thus employed will benefit themselves also. Idleness gives time to brood over imaginary sorrows, and frequently those who do not have real hardships and trials will borrow them from the future.--ST, Oct 23, 1884. (CH 629).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 631}
