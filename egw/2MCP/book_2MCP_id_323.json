{"word": "Dwelling Upon the Difficulties.--Some are always fearing and borrowing trouble. Every day they are surrounded with the tokens of God's love; every day they are enjoying the bounties of His providence; but they overlook these present blessings. Their minds are continually dwelling upon something disagreeable which they fear may come; or some difficulty may really exist which, though small, blinds their eyes to the many things that demand gratitude. The difficulties they encounter, instead of driving them to God, the only source of their help, separate them from him because they awaken unrest and repining.--SC 121, 122 (1892).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 466}
