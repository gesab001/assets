{"word": "Results of Flaunting Nature's Laws.--God has granted to this people great light, yet we are not placed beyond \n\n386 \n\nthe reach of temptation.... An invalid--apparently very conscientious, yet bigoted and self-sufficient--freely avows his contempt for the laws of health and life, which divine mercy has led us as a people to accept. His food must be prepared in a manner to satisfy his morbid cravings. Rather than sit at a table where wholesome food is provided, he will patronize restaurants, because he can there indulge appetite without restraint. A fluent advocate of temperance, he disregards its foundation principles. He wants relief but refuses to obtain it at the price of self-denial.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 385}
