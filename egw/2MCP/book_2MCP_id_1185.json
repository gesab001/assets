{"word": "The Past in New Forms.--The experience of the past will be repeated. In the future, Satan's superstitions will assume new forms. Errors will be presented in a pleasing and flattering manner. False theories, clothed with garments of light, will be presented to God's people. Thus Satan will try to deceive, if possible, the very elect. Most seducing influences will be exerted; minds will be hypnotized. --8T 293 (1904).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 719}
