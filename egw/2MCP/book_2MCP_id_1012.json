{"word": "Every Energy to Be Exercised (counsel to a young woman).--The life of the soul cannot be sustained unless it is brought into subjection to the will of God. Every energy is to be exercised in doing the divine will. Our thoughts, if stayed upon God, will be guided by divine love and power. Then, my dear child, live on the words that proceed from the lips of Christ. May the Lord strengthen and bless and guide you. Press forward and believe that if you ask, you will receive.--Lt 339, 1905. \n\n670", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 669}
