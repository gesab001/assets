{"word": "Comfort for a Rejected Orphan Boy.--Oh, this is a cold and selfish world! Your relatives, who should have loved and befriended you for your parents' sake if not for your own, have shut themselves up in their selfishness and have no special interest for you. But God will be nearer and dearer to you than any of your earthly relatives can be. He will be your friend and will never leave you. He is a father to the fatherless. His friendship will prove sweet peace to you and will help you to bear your great loss with fortitude.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 632}
