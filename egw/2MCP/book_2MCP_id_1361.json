{"word": "Wise Counseling.--Sympathy is good, wisely given, but it must be judiciously imparted, with a knowledge that the subject is deserving sympathy. What shall be said of receiving advice and counsel? Proverbs 25:9-12: \"Debate thy cause with thy neighbor himself; and discover not a secret to another: lest he that heareth it put thee to shame.... A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 772}
