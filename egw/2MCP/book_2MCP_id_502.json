{"word": "Among the members of many families there is practiced the habit of saying loose, careless things; and the habit of tantalizing, of speaking harsh words, becomes stronger and stronger as it is indulged, and thus many objectionable words are spoken that are after Satan's order and not after the order of God.... Burning words of passion should never be spoken, for in the sight of God and holy angels they are as a species of swearing.--YI, Sept 20, 1894. (AH 439.)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 518}
