{"word": "Chap. 80 - Satan's Science of Self-Exaltation\n[SEE SECTION VI, \"SELFISHNESS AND SELF-RESPECT.\"]\n\n\n     Peril of Theory of Man's Inherent Power.--If Satan can so befog and deceive the human mind as to lead mortals to think that there is an inherent power in themselves to accomplish great and good works, they cease to rely upon God to do for them that which they think there is power in themselves to do. They acknowledge not a superior power. They give not God the glory which He claims, and which is due to His great and excellent Majesty. Satan's object is thus accomplished, and he exults that fallen men presumptuously exalt themselves. --1T 294 (1862).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 722}
