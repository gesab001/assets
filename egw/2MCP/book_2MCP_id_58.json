{"word": "Indulgence Blunts Nobler Sentiments of Mind.--The indulgence of appetite in overeating is gluttony. The great variety of foods often taken at one meal is enough to create a disordered stomach and a disordered temper. Therefore God requires of every human being cooperation with Him, that none may go beyond his proper boundary in overeating or in partaking of improper articles of food. This indulgence strengthens the animal propensities and blunts the nobler sentiments of the mind. The whole being is degraded, and the human agent becomes the slave of appetite, by pampering and indulging his own groveling sensual passions.--MS 113, 1898. \n\n\n                                                   389", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 388}
