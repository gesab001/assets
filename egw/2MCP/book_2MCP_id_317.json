{"word": "The Best Comforters.--Those who have borne the greatest sorrows are frequently the ones who carry the greatest comfort to others, bringing sunshine wherever they go. Such ones have been chastened and sweetened by their afflictions; they did not lose confidence in God when trouble assailed them, but clung closer to His protecting love. Such ones are a living proof of the tender care of God, who makes the darkness as well as the light, and chastens us for our good. Christ is the light of the world; in Him is no darkness. Precious light! Let us live in that light! Bid adieu to sadness and repining. \"Rejoice in the Lord always; and again I say, Rejoice.\"--HR, Oct., 1877. (2SM 274.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 464}
