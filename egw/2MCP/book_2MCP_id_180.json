{"word": "Happiness Depends Upon Perfect Accord With God's Laws.--The law of love being the foundation of the government of God, the happiness of all created beings depended upon their perfect accord with its great principles of righteousness. God desires from all His creatures the service of love--homage that springs from an intelligent appreciation of His character. He takes no pleasure in a forced allegiance, and to all He grants freedom of will, that they may render Him voluntary service.--GC 493 (1888).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 422}
