{"word": "Aches and Pains Nature's Protest.--Many are living in violation of the laws of health and are ignorant of the relation their habits of eating, drinking, and working sustain to their health. They will not arouse to their true condition until nature protests against the abuses she is suffering, by aches and pains in the system. If even then the sufferers would only commence the work right, and would resort to the simple means they have neglected-- the use of water and proper diet--nature would have just the help she requires and which she ought to have had long before. If this course is pursued, the patient will generally recover without being debilitated.--HL (Part 3) 61, 1865. (2SM 451.) \n\n\n                                                     511", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 510}
