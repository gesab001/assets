{"word": "The mental and moral powers which God has given us do not constitute character. They are talents which we are to improve and which, if properly improved, will form a right character. A man may have precious seed in his hand, but that seed is not an orchard. The seed must be planted before it can become a tree. The mind is the garden; the character is the fruit. God has given us our faculties to cultivate and develop. Our own course determines our character. In training these powers so that \n\n546 \n\nthey shall harmonize and form a valuable character, we have a work which no one but ourselves can do.-- 4T 606 (1881).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 545}
