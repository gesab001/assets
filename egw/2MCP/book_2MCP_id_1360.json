{"word": "There are thickets, quagmires, and dangerous crevices \n\n772 \n\nin the rocks, and the Shepherd knows that if the sheep is in any of these places a friendly hand must lift it out. When He discovers the lost one, He does not heap reproaches upon it. He is only glad that He has found it alive. When He hears its bleating afar off, He encounters any and every difficulty that He may save His sheep that was lost. With firm yet gentle hand He parts the briers, or takes it from the mire; He tenderly lifts it to His shoulders and bears it back to the fold. The pure, sinless Redeemer bears the sinful, the unclean.--MS 17, 1895.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 771}
