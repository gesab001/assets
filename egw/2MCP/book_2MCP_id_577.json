{"word": "Faith in Christ, Not the Robe.--As He was passing, she [the infirm woman] reached forward and succeeded in barely touching the border of His garment. That moment she knew that she was healed. Her faith was centered, not in the robe, but in Him who wore the robe. In that one touch was concentrated the faith of her life, and instantly her pain and feebleness disappeared. Instantly she felt the thrill as of an electric current passing through every fiber of her being. There came over her a sensation of perfect health. \"Straightway . . . she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague\" (Mark 5:29).--Lt 111, 1904.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 539}
