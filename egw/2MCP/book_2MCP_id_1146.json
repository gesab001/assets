{"word": "Unity Without Submerged Identity.--We are now to unify.... But let us remember that Christian unity does not mean that the identity of one person is to be submerged in that of another, nor does it mean that the mind of one is to be led and controlled by the mind of another. God has not given to any man the power that some, by word and act, seek to claim. God requires every man to stand free and to follow the directions of the word.--8T 212 (1904).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 708}
