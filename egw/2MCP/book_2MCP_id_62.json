{"word": "Restrict the Varieties of Food.--We must care for the digestive organs and not force upon them a great variety of food. He who gorges himself with many kinds of food at a meal is doing himself injury. It is more important that we eat that which will agree with us than that we taste of every dish that may be placed before us. There is no door in our stomach by which we can look in and see what is going on; so we must use our mind, and reason from cause to effect. If you feel all wrought up, \n\n390 \n\nand everything seems to go wrong, perhaps it is because you are suffering the consequences of eating a great variety of food.--MS 41, 1908.
