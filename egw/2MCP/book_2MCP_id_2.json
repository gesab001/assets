{"word": "Harmony Depends Upon Conformity to Fixed Laws. --The harmony of creation depends upon the perfect conformity of all beings, of everything, animate and inanimate, to the law of the Creator. God has ordained laws for the government, not only of living beings, but of all the operations of nature. Everything is under fixed laws, which cannot be disregarded. But while everything in nature is governed by natural laws, man alone, of all that inhabits the earth, is amenable to moral law.--PP 52 (1890).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 373}
