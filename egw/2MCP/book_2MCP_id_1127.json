{"word": "Christ Could Have Opened the Door of Science.-- A minister once said that he could but think that Christ must have known something about science. Of what could this minister have been thinking? Science! Christ could have opened door after door of science. He could have revealed to men treasures of science on which they might have feasted to the present time. But knowing that this knowledge would have been appropriated to unholy uses, He did not open the door.--MS 105, 1901. (MM 116.) \n\n\n                                                    703", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 702}
