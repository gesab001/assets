{"word": "The Physician Who Deals With Distracted Minds and Hearts.--The physician needs more than human wisdom and power that he may know how to minister to the many perplexing cases of disease of the mind and heart with which he is called to deal. If he is ignorant of the power of divine grace, he cannot help the afflicted one, but will aggravate the difficulty; but if he has a firm hold upon God, he will be able to help the diseased, distracted mind. He will be able to point his patients to Christ and teach them to carry all their cares and perplexities to the great Burden Bearer.--5T 444 (1885). \n\n\n                                                       409", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 408}
