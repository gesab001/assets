{"word": "To have faith in the promises of God, to walk forward by faith, pressing on without being governed by circumstances, is a lesson hard to learn. Yet it is a positive necessity that every child of God learn this lesson. The grace of God through Christ is to be ever cherished; for it is given to us as the only way of approaching God. Faith in the words of God, spoken by Christ enshrouded in the \n\n534 \n\npillar of cloud, would have enabled the children of Israel to leave a record of a very different character. Their lack of faith in God gave them a very checkered history.-- MS 43, 1898.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 533}
