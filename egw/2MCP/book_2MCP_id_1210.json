{"word": "This pretense of conscientiousness has been pretty thoroughly tested and proved. I speak understandingly when I tell you that I have very little confidence in his conscientiousness. There is a good conscience and a bad conscience, and the man is most thoroughly deceived in himself.

Yet he will be as immovable as a rock to counsel or to any way except his own way.--Lt 48, 1892.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 725}
