{"word": "Counsel to a Young Woman Regarding the Dangers of Castle-building.--You should control your thoughts. This will not be an easy task; you cannot accomplish it without close and even severe effort. Yet God requires this of you; it is a duty resting upon every accountable being. You are responsible to God for your thoughts.

All that prevents the action is the lack of opportunity.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 661}
