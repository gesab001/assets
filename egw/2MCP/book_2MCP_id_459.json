{"word": "Overconcentration Wears Our Vital Organs.--The power to concentrate the mind upon one subject to the exclusion of all others is well in a degree; but the constant exercise of this faculty wears upon those organs that are called into use to do this work; it throws too great a tax upon them, and the result is a failure to accomplish the greatest amount of good.

The mind cannot thus be healthfully exercised, and, in consequence, life is shortened.--3T 34 (1872).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 507}
