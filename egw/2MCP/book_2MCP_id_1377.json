{"word": "Make God Man's Confessor.--Everyone needs a practical experience in trusting God for himself. Let no man become your confessor; open the heart to God; tell Him every secret of the soul. Bring to Him your difficulties, small and great, and He will show you a way out of them all. He alone can know how to give the very help you need.--GW 418 (1915).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 777}
