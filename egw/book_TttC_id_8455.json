    "word": "When Israel was oppressed by the Ammonites, the chosen people made a plea before God that illustrates the definite character of true confession: \"And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, We have sinned against Thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim. And the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? . . . Yet ye have forsaken Me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more. Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. And the children of Israel said unto the Lord, We have sinned: do Thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto Thee; deliver us only, we pray Thee, this day.\" Then they began to act in harmony with their confessions and prayers. \"They put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord.\" And the Lord's great heart of love was grieved, was grieved for the misery of Israel.\"",
