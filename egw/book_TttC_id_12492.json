    "word": "In the Cities of the East \n\n     Instruction has been given me that the message should go again with power in the cities in the Eastern States. In many of the large cities of the East the first and second angels' messages were proclaimed during the 1844 movement. To us, as God's servants, has been entrusted the third angel's message, the binding-off message, that is to prepare a people for the coming of the King. We are to make every effort to give a knowledge of the truth to all who will hear, and there are many who will listen. All through the large cities God has honest souls who are interested in what is truth.",
