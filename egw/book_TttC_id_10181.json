The people \"came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the Lord's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.\" They came, both men and women, as many as were willinghearted. Men came with their gifts of gold and silver, choice fabrics, and valuable wood. The rulers brought precious stones, costly spices, and oil for the lights. \"And all the women that were wisehearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun.\" They brought \"free offerings every morning,\" until the report was given to Moses: \"The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the Lord commanded to make.\" Exodus 35:21-25; 36:3,5. This generous-hearted, willing service was pleasing to God; and when the tabernacle was completed, He signified His acceptance of the offering. \"A cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.\" Exodus 40:34.",
