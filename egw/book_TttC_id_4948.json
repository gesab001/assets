    "word": "Christ left His riches and glory, and became poor, that man through His poverty might be made rich. He now requires him for the sake of these riches to yield earthly things and secure heaven. Christ knew that while the affections were upon worldly treasure, they would be withdrawn from God; \n                                                                           50\ntherefore He said to the lawyer: \"Go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me.\" How did he receive the words of Christ? Was he rejoiced that he could secure the heavenly treasure? He was very sorrowful, for he had great possessions. To him riches were honor and power. The great amount of his treasure made such a disposal of it seem like an impossibility.",
