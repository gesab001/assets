{"word": "They turned to flee, but the angel's words stayed their steps. \"Fear not ye,\" he said; \"for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead.\" Again they look into the tomb, and again they hear the wonderful news. Another angel in human form is there, and he says, \"Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.\"-- DA 788, 789 (1898).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 69}
