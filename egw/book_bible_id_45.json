{"word": "Those who love society frequently indulge this trait until it becomes an overruling passion. . . . They cannot endure to read the Bible and contemplate heavenly things. They are miserable unless there is something to excite. They have not within them the power to be happy, but they depend for happiness upon the company of other youth as thoughtless and reckless as themselves. The powers which might be turned to noble purposes they give to folly and mental dissipation.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AH", "page": 457}
