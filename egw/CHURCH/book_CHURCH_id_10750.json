    "word": "In the word of God we are given plain directions as to the course we are to follow when we think a brother is in the wrong. Christ says: \"If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.\" And again the Saviour says, \"If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, \n                                                                           45\nand go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.\" Matthew 18:15-17;  5:23, 24.",
