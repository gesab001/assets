    "word": "Here is a people who have had the privilege of listening to the word of the Lord; and if they had listened to a purpose, they would have known \n\n\n                                     -4- \n\nthat they had heard the truth, and they would have practiced it. But they have not done this. Departing from the plain, direct messages God has sent them, which were essential for them to receive and act upon, they have enjoyed their own selfish indulgences. They have chosen to do as the scribes and Pharisees did--according to their own impulses. The scribes and Pharisees opposed the mission of our Lord. These churches have entered upon the same evil course, and do not walk with the Lord Jesus Christ, for how can two walk together, except they be agreed?",
