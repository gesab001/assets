    "word": "Feb. 4. \"Show us a Miracle, and We will Believe.\" Today I have written a little on the Life of Christ but I was obliged to spend the greater part of the time entertaining visitors. I now take up my diary to write out some things that are occupying my mind. I am burdened day and night by the thought of the condition of the Battle Creek church. Some have backslidden from God because they have not accepted the messages sent them from time to time. They show that they are spiritually blind. They know not what spirit they are of. They say, Show us by working miracles that you are of God. But in this very age they have seen miracles wrought by God. After the Minneapolis meeting how wonderfully the Spirit of God wrought; Men confessed that they had robbed God by withholding tithes and offerings. Many souls were converted. \n                                                                           578\nThousands of dollars were brought into the treasury. Rich experiences were related by those whose hearts were aglow with the love of God. And yet from the lips of some who have attempted to preach the truth comes the cry, \"What miracle dost thou work? Show us a miracle, and we will believe.\" God has been present in the meetings that have been held. What greater evidence could men be given than they have had? What more could the Lord do than He has already done. Is not the conversion of the human heart the greatest miracle that can be wrought? This miracle has been wrought, but upon some hard hearts it has left no impression.",
