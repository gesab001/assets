    "word": "I saw that the church at Monterey should learn wisdom. Some have made matters a great deal worse by going to extremes. Brother David Rumsey has been too fast and acted unwisely. He has taken advantage of Brother Albert's failings to build himself up. There is cause for deep humility on his part, and to consider himself lest he stumble and be overthrown. Some who have had but little or no influence for good have been free to talk to this matter and to exaggerate. That which they did not know, they have surmised and guessed at. Such mouths should be stopped; they are a curse to the church.",
