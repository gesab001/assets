    "word": "Physicians should understand that a soft answer turneth away wrath. Policy must be used in an institution where the sick are treated, in order to successfully control diseased minds and benefit the sick. If physicians can remain calm amid a tempest of inconsiderate, passionate words, if they can rule their own spirits when provoked and abused, they are indeed conquerors. \"He that ruleth his spirit\" is better \"than he that taketh a city.\" Proverbs 16:32. To subdue self and bring the passions under the control of the will is the greatest conquest that men and women can achieve.--Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, pp. 182, 183 (1872). \n\n\n                                                   (351)",
