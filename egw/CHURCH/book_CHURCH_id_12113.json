    "word": "MR No. 585 - Inherited and Cultivated Tendencies to Sin\n\n     The Lord said to Joshua, \"Neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.\" (Joshua 7:12.) The defects of character in any member of the church, or in the minister, are charged to the church, if the church make light of the defects. If you place Elder _____ over the church as a minister, you, as a church, assume his defects, you make them your own, and the whole church stands under the rebuke of God, even as ancient Israel was under His rebuke on account of the sin of Achan. But your case will be more grievous than theirs, because you knew the evil, yet hid your eyes from it, and walked contrary to the will of God.--Ms 1a, 1890, pp. 4, 5. (\"A Consecrated Ministry,\" February 13, 1890.)",
