    "word": "Nothing so manifestly weakens a church as disunion and strife. Nothing so wars against Christ and the truth as this spirit. \"By their fruits ye shall know them\" (Matthew 7:20). \"Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom\" (James 3:11-13).",
