    "word": "On Friday, Sara and Willie accompanied me to Sydney. We went directly to Sister Tuxford's home and found a room all prepared for me. That evening I was invited to speak to the workers in the Sanitarium, and the Lord gave me liberty in prayer and speech. I spoke to them plainly on the necessity of faithfulness in the discharge of every duty. All seemed to be interested and pleased, and all save one bore their testimony. On Sabbath I attended the afternoon meeting in Stanmore and spoke to a well-filled church. The blessing of the Lord was in the meeting. I longed to see the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and I entreated the people to choose God as their portion. Many excellent testimonies were borne, and the Spirit of the Lord was with us.",
