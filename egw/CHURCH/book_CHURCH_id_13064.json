    "word": "Let every member of the churches in Iowa carefully study the instruction given in the fifty-eight chapter of Isaiah and in the third and fourth chapters of Malachi. Will my brethren consider these scriptures? In the fifty-eighth of Isaiah there is light for those who rejoice in the hope of the soon-coming morning. The Lord desires to send us the reviving, healing beams of His sunshine. \"The fashion of this world passeth away,\" but the fashion of the world to come will endure forever. With that infinite bliss will the righteous be rewarded! What boundless joy will be theirs!",
