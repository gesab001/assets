    "word": "A responsibility to spread the knowledge of right principles rests upon all who have received the light. This responsibility should be felt by every man and woman who claims to be a Seventh-day Adventist, and much more by those who are connected with our institutions. All should realize that these institutions are an important part of the Lord's great work for the salvation of souls. Let it be the aim of all to be laborers together with God for the uplifting of humanity. All should be educators by precept and example. They should feel a personal responsibility to send forth men and women as fully instructed as possible, prepared to exert a direct and saving influence in the homes, the communities, and the churches to which they go. This would be the very best recommendation that any of our institutions could have.",
