    "word": "When the Lord's messenger bears a message to the church, God is speaking to the people, awakening the conscience to see that they have not been rendering an honest tithe to the Lord, and that when it was not convenient to give, they have failed to present their offerings to Him. They have used the Lord's own money for themselves, in building houses, in purchasing horses, carriages, or lands. They do this in the hope of large returns, and every year they have the same excuse. \"Will a man rob God?\" (Malachi 3:8). Oh, yes, he has done this many times, because he has not been spiritual, to discern the spiritual things.",
