    "word": "Those who have earthly possessions will have a work to do, a sacrifice to make. . . . When the truth is presented in its clearness and is brought to bear upon the heart, some, while under the warming, quickening influence of the Spirit of God, get the sacrifice almost on the altar. But they do not consecrate all fully to God, and as the saving influence of the truth wears away they lose the spirit of sacrifice, the strong foe again obtains control of the mind, the love of the world revives, and again they hug it to their bosoms and serve their treasure instead of God. The battle is between truth and the love of the world.--Ms 4, 1860, p. 1. (Testimony to Monterey, Michigan, church, undated.)",
