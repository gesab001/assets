Sutherland, \n     Dear Brother:-- \n\n\n     In your letter you ask me serious questions, and lay out propositions which are sensible and right. There should be schools established wherever there is a church or company of believers. Teachers should be employed to educate the children of Sabbath-keepers. This would close the door to a large number who are drifting into Battle Creek,--the very place where the Lord has warned them not to go. In the light that has been given me, I have been pointed to the churches that are scattered in different localities, and I have been shown that the strength of these churches depends upon their growth in usefulness and efficiency.",
