    "word": "Thursday morning, May 27. Our five o'clock social meeting has just closed. Advancement has been made. Elder Van Horn met the case in humble confession before the people for his neglect. The spirit of confession came in. Brother Nichols took a good stand. I spoke about thirty minutes and there was a break. We feel that the work is going well, but it has moved slowly. When we come into meeting today, we shall make a call for those who pledged and cannot pay. I shall then propose to pay for them and thus provoke my brethren to good works. I think this will make a break in the meetings, still more marked. Oh, how much this people have needed instruction. Our work is only for the churches. We cannot break new fields. We must confine our labors to the churches.",
