    "word": "At the Valencia St. Station, we secured a cab, and spent an hour and a half riding through the streets of the stricken city. Terrible were the sights that met our eyes. The situation there can scarcely be exaggerated. Our church on Laguna Street was not burned. The chimney is down, and the building has been damaged otherwise, to the extent of about a thousand dollars, we are told. The beautiful park close by is a safe retreat for many refugees. All of these scenes were a very solemn import to me.",
