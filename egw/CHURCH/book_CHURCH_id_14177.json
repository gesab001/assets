There are a few who carry the burden, a few who pray much and talk little, a few who always bear their testimony. But there are many, many who are mere spectators. Why are not those who hear the word doers of the word? Why do they not arise and shine, because their light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon them? Christ will not accept the highest profession, the most eloquent words, unaccompanied by a faithful practice of the truth. Men may have talent and education, but of what avail is this if the love of God does not abide in their hearts, if they are not clothed with His righteousness. The watchmen must catch the words from the lips of Christ, and give the trumpet a certain sound. Their message must bear the divine credentials, and God must give it efficiency, else they will be false guides.",
