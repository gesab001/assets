    "word": "The true Witness presents encouragements to all who are seeking to walk in the path of humble obedience, through faith in His name. He declares, \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.\" These are the words of our Substitute and Surety. He who is the divine Head of the church, the mightiest of conquerors, would point His followers to His life, His toils, His self-denials, His struggles and sufferings, through contempt, through rejection, ridicule, scorn, insult, mockery, falsehood, up the path of Calvary to the scene of the crucifixion, that they might be encouraged to press on toward the mark for the prize and reward of the overcomer. Victory is assured through faith and obedience.",
