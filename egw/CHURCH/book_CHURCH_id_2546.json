    "word": "Co-Operation Among the Churches\n     [FROM A SERMON PREACHED TO THE GENERAL CONFERENCE OF 1883.] \n     There is a great dearth of spirituality in the Conferences of the different States; the churches are suffering, not so much for the want of sermons as for lack of ministry. The members of the churches need personal labor; they need to be instructed as to how they can engage in the work of God. In the winter, special efforts should be put forth. Let the different churches visit one another from time to time. Thus one church may encourage another by the manifestation of friendly, Christ-like interest in the spiritual \n242\nwelfare of the brethren. Those who will engage in active service for the good of others will find that their own souls will be revived and quickened, and those whom they visit will be encouraged and strengthened by the interest of their brethren in their behalf.",
