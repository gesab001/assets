    "word": "Christian Sources of Pleasure \n\n     God has provided for every one pleasure that may be enjoyed by rich and poor alike,--the pleasure found in cultivating pureness of thought and unselfishness of action, the pleasure that comes from speaking sympathizing words and doing kindly deeds. From those who perform such service, the light of Christ shines to brighten lives darkened by many sorrows.--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. IX, page 57.",
