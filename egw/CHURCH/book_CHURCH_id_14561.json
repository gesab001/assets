    "word": "The citizens of Healdsburg made the request that I should speak on Sunday afternoon, March 27, that they might hear me once more. Rain had fallen continuously through the week, and Sunday was rainy and disagreeable. I had been sick and under vigorous treatment ever since the Sabbath before; but I ventured out, though so weak that I could scarcely stand on my feet without assistance. As I looked at the large congregation gathered in the church, I felt fearful that I could not make them all hear. But the Lord strengthened me, and I spoke for over an hour, from the first two chapters of Revelation. Those present were much interested, and expressed themselves as being greatly benefited by the discourse. I saw tears running down more than one face.",
