    "word": "Some fathers and mothers are so indifferent, so careless, that they think it makes no difference whether their children attend a church school or a public school. \"We are in the world\" they say, \"and we can not get out of it.\" But, parents, we can get a good way out of the world, if we choose to do so, we can avoid seeing many of the evils that are multiplying so fast in these last day. We can avoid hearing about much of the wickedness and crime that exist.",
