    "word": "Saying consecration, praying consecration, are not enough. We must practice consecration. We feel deeply pained to see the absence of consecration in the individual members of the church. These reach too high. When they bring their consecration down into their very words and actions, into their associations with one another, they will bring consecration into their practical life. It is present religion we need, not an imaginary religion. It is a Saviour today to help us. It is to reveal Christ in our words today; it is to be kind, tender, and affectionate today; it is to esteem others better than ourselves today. Each separate word and action is to show consecration not to ourselves, \n\n\n                                     -307- \n\nbut to God. We are fitting up for heaven. The Spirit of Jesus dwells in us richly by faith.",
