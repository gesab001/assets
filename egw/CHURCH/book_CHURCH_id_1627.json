    "word": "It is through the exercise of this practical love that the churches draw nearer together in Christian unity. Through the love of the brethren, love to God is increased, because He has not forgotten those who were in distress, and thus thank offerings ascend to God for His care. \"For the ministration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God.\" The faith of the brethren is increased in God, and they are led to commit their souls and bodies unto God as to a faithful Creator. \"Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men.\"--R. & H., Aug. 21, 1894.",
