    "word": "I write this morning to tell you that we desire you to attend if possible, the Fresno camp-meeting. The Fresno and the Los Angeles meetings are the only ones that I expect to attend this season, --not but that I should be glad to attend others, but I must spend most of the time in preparing my writings for publication, so that they may be placed in the hands of the people. For the first time since returning to this country, Willie has taken hold of my book in earnest. All our helpers are doing excellent work in this line.
