    "word": "The Lord Jesus Christ gave the message to John to be written, to come down through the ages to the end of the world. Words of commendation are spoken to the church of Ephesus. The \"Well done\" is pronounced on the good and faithful servant. But the message does not close here. The Saviour says, \"Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.\" This has been brought in clear lines before me again and again, and I have presented it to the people with pen and voice.",
