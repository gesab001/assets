    "word": "There is a great work to be done in the earth, and the Lord Jesus has taken men into copartnership with Himself, in order that heavenly agencies may cooperate with human agencies. Christ was in travail of soul for the redemption of the world, and those who are laborers together with God are representatives of Christ to our world, and will have compassion for the lost, and will travail in soul for the redemption of men. Unless the church awakes and stands to her post of duty, God will charge the loss of souls to her account. I have a deep interest that the work of God shall advance.",
