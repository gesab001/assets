    "word": "Unless the truth sanctifies the soul, unless it leads to humility and meekness, self-denial and self-surrender, the enemy will gain influence on his side. Let the effort made be in harmony with sacred truth of heavenly origin. The Holy Spirit will be imparted and the church will be consistent, and will fulfil the injunction, \u201cArise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.\u201d They will live not unto themselves, but unto Christ who died for them, and rose again, and liveth to make intercession for the saints.",
