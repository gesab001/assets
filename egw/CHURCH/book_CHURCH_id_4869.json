    "word": "We should customarily bow on our knees when praying.--Both in public and in private worship, it is our duty to bow upon our knees [THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE ELLEN WHITE STOOD AT THE DESK WHILE OFFERING PRAYERS OF CONSECRATION DURING CHURCH SERVICES. SEE 3SM 266-270.] before God when we offer our petitions to Him. Jesus, our example, \"kneeled down, and prayed.\" And of His disciples it is recorded that they, too, \"kneeled down, and prayed.\" Stephen \"kneeled.\" Paul declared: \"I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" In confessing before God the sins of Israel, Ezra knelt. Daniel \"kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God.\" And the invitation of the psalmist is: \"O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\"--RH Nov. 30, 1905.",
