    "word": "You are not to place yourself where a multiplicity of cares will crowd upon you. And above all, you are not to forget that you have a church in your own home to care for. This point must be considered. You have children to guide and direct. In studying the differences in their dispositions and tendencies, you will gain a valuable experience. Do not try to embrace too much in your labors. If you do this, you will not have opportunity to study the characters of your children.",
