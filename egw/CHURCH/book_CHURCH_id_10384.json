    "word": "I have borne a plain testimony. I have felt a burden of the work, a burden of soul that I never expect to feel again for the church at Battle Creek. God has let his Spirit drop upon me right in their midst. I have exhorted the youth. My spirit was stirred within me as I saw by their course of action how little they understood of true Christian religion. Professing Christ, yet in their works denying him; given up to pride, vanity, love of pleasure, love of self, idolaters in the sight of God. The intercourse of some with the world was such as to justify the sinner in his unbelief. There was not seen in their lives the grace of the Spirit of God. They did not possess moral courage and spiritual energy. They lured on souls to death. Souls have gone down into the grave who might have had a fitness for Heaven, had all those who professed Christ \n                                                                           75\nwalked even as he walked. Professors of godliness have taken souls who were not as favorably situated as themselves to form a good religious character, and have, through their example and influence, linked their hands with the world, and by their course of action have said, The pleasures of the world are harmless; you can love God, and love self, and the world. You can profess Christ and yet live as the world live, love what the world love. Their example has said, You may lay aside your religious principles when not convenient to retain them.",
