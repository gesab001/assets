    "word": "HON. L. Q. C. LAMAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR UNDER PRESIDENT CLEVELAND, WAS CHARGED WITH GIVING TO CATHOLICS MORE POSITIONS IN HIS DEPARTMENT THAN TO OTHER DENOMINATIONS. HIS REPLY WAS THAT \u201cIF ROMAN CATHOLICS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN OTHER DENOMINATIONS, IT IS ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE ASKED MORE LARGELY;\u201d AND EXPLAINED THIS BY SAYING THAT THE ROMISH CHURCH HAS AT WASHINGTON \u201cAN ENERGETIC AND TIRELESS DIRECTOR, WHO IS ACTIVE TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXTENDING MISSIONARY AND EDUCATIONAL WORK AMONG THE INDIANS.\u201d THE CHRISTIAN UNION SAYS THAT FOUR-FIFTHS OF THE GOVERNMENT INDIAN SCHOOLS, UNDER RELIGIOUS CONTROL, HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ROMAN CATHOLICS. THE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, UNDER PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S ADMINISTRATION,\u2014MR. ZACH. MONTGOMERY,\u2014 IS A ROMAN CATHOLIC, WITH ALL THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ENMITY TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND HESITATES NOT TO USE HIS OFFICIAL POSITION AND INFLUENCE TO SHOW IT. DURING HIS TERM OF OFFICE, IN AN ADDRESS AT CARROLL INSTITUTE, HE OPENLY DENOUNCED THE PUBLIC-SCHOOL SYSTEM AS GODLESS, ANTI PARENTAL, AND DESTRUCTIVE OF HAPPINESS. AND THE UNITED STATES SENATE FULLY KNEW HIS ENMITY TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEN IT CONFIRMED HIS APPOINTMENT AS ASSISTANT ATTORNEY-GENERAL. THE NEW YORK OBSERVER SAYS THAT THE ONLY PUBLIC HOSPITAL THAT RECEIVES ANY GOVERNMENT AID IS A ROMAN CATHOLIC ONE.",
