    "word": "This is the nature of the instruction that we are giving in the morning meetings, and we hope some good is being effected. I feel Jesus verily present. I tell you in the fear \n\n\n                                     -308- \n\nof God, our churches are altogether too formal. The love, the tenderness of Christ, is not expressed in practice in their intercourse with one another. We must not demerit ourselves and lightly esteem the ability given us of God, neither should we overestimate our own importance and trust to our human ability. Those who have far less ability may verily be doing far more for the Master because they put out to the exchangers every talent they possess. They keep up an unfaltering purpose, a brave heart, and a calm, peaceful, trusting confidence in God because they believe His Word.",
