    "word": "Let every church school established be conducted with such order that Christ can honor the schoolroom with His presence. The Master will accept no cheap, shoddy service. Let teachers be learners, putting the whole mind to the task of learning how to do efficient service. They should ever carry a burden for souls--not that they themselves can save souls, but as God's helping hand they have the privilege of winning their pupils to Christ.",
