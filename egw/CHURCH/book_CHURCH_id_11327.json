    "word": "The Lord has revealed to me that when the members of the church in _____ shall learn to deny themselves, when they shall consecrate themselves to God, when they shall practice economy as truehearted sons and daughters of God; when they shall expend much less for outward display, and shall wear plain, simple clothing without unnecessary adornments; when their faith and works shall correspond, then they will be the Lord's true missionaries and will have clear discernment and spiritual understanding. They will have a sense of the sacredness of God's work. They will see the necessity of the tithe money being faithfully paid into the treasury, and reserved for the sacred work to which God designs that it shall be devoted,--to carry the last message of mercy to a fallen world. God's people are to lift the standard of truth in every place where the message of mercy has not been proclaimed.",
