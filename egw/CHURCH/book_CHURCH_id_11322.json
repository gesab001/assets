    "word": "Not for Common Necessities of the House of God \n\n\n     Letters have come to me from Oakland and Battle Creek, making inquiries as to the disposition made of the tithe.

From that which has been shown me, the tithe is not to be withdrawn from the treasury. Every penny of this money is the Lord's own sacred treasure, to be appropriated for a special use. . . .",
