    "word": "We are seated in the depot at Cologne. This place has a cathedral, commenced in 1232. The spire is five hundred thirty-two feet, and the church is five hundred thirty-two feet. There are more than five thousand pinnacles, and this building is not yet completed. This building is fairly bristling with pinnacles. There are services held every day, and people go to the confessional. This is the second, or equal to any cathedral in the world. If I can get a picture of it, will send it to you.--Letter 89, 1887. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. October 2, 1986.",
