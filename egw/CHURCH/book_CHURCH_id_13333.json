    "word": "MR No. 1402 - Marriage of W. C. White; Speaking and Writing in Tasmania; Jesus Our Example\n\n     (Written May 12, 1895, from Launceston, Tasmania, to \"Dear Brother and Sister Olsen.\") \n\n\n     W. C. White, May Lacey White, and myself left the home of Brother Lacey in Glenorchy about nine o'clock p.m. to take the cars for Launceston. My son and Miss May Lacey were married today by a clergyman who, though not of our faith, has favored our people, letting them have the use of his church without charge. The preparations for the marriage ceremony were carried out without one unpleasant feature. We would all have been much better pleased if one of our own ministers could have officiated at the marriage, but this could not be without incurring considerable expense, as we should have had to send for one of our brethren to come from New South Wales, where I think some are qualified to perform marriages. There was no minister in Tasmania who was authorized to act in this capacity.",
