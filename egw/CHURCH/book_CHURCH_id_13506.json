    "word": "Are those who speak these words converted, and from what? Are their tongues converted, their appetites converted? Can it be said of them, Ye are laborers together with God? They do not realize what it means to wear Christ's yoke or to lift His burden. Their children may be members of the church, or they may be impenitent still, for they have never lived in an atmosphere of faith and love, and therefore they do not know what real service to God means. When the overflowing scourge shall come, it will not pass them by. God has a love for their souls, but they have ceased to have any love for themselves.",
