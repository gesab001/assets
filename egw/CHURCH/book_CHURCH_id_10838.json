    "word": "COMPLETE SEPARATION.--THE COMMAND FOUND IN REVELATION 18:4, \"COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE,\" MEANS TO COME OUT OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS WHICH WILL PLACE IN THE MINDS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE APT TO MAKE THEM JOIN THE CLASS OF WORSHIPERS OF WHICH WE READ IN 2 TIMOTHY 3:5: \"HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT DENYING THE POWER THEREOF.\" AS FAITHFUL WATCHMEN, WE SHOULD BE JUST AS DESIROUS OF GETTING OUR CHILDREN OUT OF THE POPULAR SCHOOLS AS WE ARE TO CALL THE OLDER PEOPLE OUT OF THE POPULAR CHURCHES. THE POPULAR CHURCHES ARE ONLY A PRODUCT OF WORLDLY EDUCATION, SO TO GET AT THE ROOT OF THE MATTER, WE MUST SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THAT WHICH CREATES THE CONDITION IN WHICH ALL THE RELIGIOUS WORLD, AT PRESENT, FINDS ITSELF.",
