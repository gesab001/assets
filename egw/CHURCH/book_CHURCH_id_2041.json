    "word": "Counsel to Churches Where City Efforts Are Held. --About four years ago, when Elder Haskell and others were conducting a Bible training school and evening services in New York City, the word of the Lord to the workers there was: \"Let the believers living near the place where you are holding meetings, share the burden of the work. They should feel it a duty and a privilege to help make the meetings a success. God is pleased by efforts to set them at work. He desires every church member to labor as His helping hand, seeking by loving ministry to win souls to Christ.\". . .",
