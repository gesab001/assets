    "word": "I have decided to walk out by faith and secure a site for a hospital. I shall send to America, asking the members of our churches to donate a dime each, and those whose hearts are willing, a larger sum; for this building we \n\n\n                                    -218- \n\nmust have, and we shall go to work to erect it just as soon as we can possibly obtain means. We shall build as cheaply as we can, and then this building will be succeeded by a better one. We can do scarcely anything for the sick unless we have a place in which they can be given treatment. We shall wait, and watch, and pray, trusting God's living word. We feel deeply the need of men to work and money to use.",
