    "word": "God has been greatly dishonored by the spirit which has led men to present matters in a false light. They have received evidence piled upon evidence, and have had all the light that will come to them in regard to the work given me of God. Until their understanding is sanctified, God will not be glorified by my placing before them the precious, sacred things he has given \n                                                                           1718\nme. I therefore feel no call to meet with you at Battle Creek, where the enemy has been permitted to take possession of minds and hearts, leading them to deceive themselves and others. I have felt deep humiliation of soul as I have been led to understand the treatment of the light given me for the people. I will visit the churches, but I am not called upon to place myself where I will be subject to unsanctified speeches. To many souls all that I might do or say would be worse than lost. I will embrace every opportunity to work for those who are in the darkness of error, who have never heard the truth. I will attend meetings where I can talk with those who have never had the light to reject.",
