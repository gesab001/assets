    "word": "All through my Christian experience I have been presented with the neglect of our churches to show that care and wisdom that Christ would have them show in looking not only on their own things, but also on the things of others. We are to be kind and attentive to those around us, helping in every necessity, relieving the oppressed, and giving them every encouragement. To love God supremely and to love our neighbor as ourselves--these are the two great principles of the law of God. If the Lord has placed means in our hands so that we can relieve those who are in need, there should not be a question in our minds as to the part we should act toward these unfortunate ones.",
