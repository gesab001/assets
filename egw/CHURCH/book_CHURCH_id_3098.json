    "word": "448\n     Roman Catholics acknowledge that the change of the Sabbath was made by their church, and declare that Protestants, by observing the Sunday, are recognizing her power. In the \u201cCatholic Catechism of Christian Religion,\u201d in answer to a question as to the day to be observed in obedience to the fourth commandment, this statement is made: \u201cDuring the old law, Saturday was the day sanctified; but the church, instructed by Jesus Christ, and directed by the Spirit of God, has substituted Sunday for Saturday; so now we sanctify the first, not the seventh day. Sunday means, and now is, the day of the Lord.\u201d",
