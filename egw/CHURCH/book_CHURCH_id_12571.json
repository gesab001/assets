    "word": "I have been thinking that it would be a good thing to send down all those little books by Brother Haughey on the coming of the Lord. I have saved some to carry to different places, but will now have them sent down here. Then there are our papers, Present Truth, the Signs of the Times, Youth's Instructor, and our church papers. Gather up what you can find in my room, and send them down. We will try to get subscribers for some of these papers. I want to see those who are interested furnished with reading matter.",
