    "word": "About three o'clock we took the cars for Hobart. We had a first-class compartment to ourselves most of the way, and at about nine o'clock in the evening we arrived at Hobart, and were heartily greeted by Brother Lacey and several members of his family. We were conducted to the hospitable home of Brother and Sister Lacey. On the Sabbath we went to a small church in which \n\n\n                                     -258- \n\nwere assembled a much larger number of Sabbathkeepers than I supposed would be found there. The Lord gave me freedom as I spoke to the people. On Sunday night I spoke in a large Temperance Hall where quite a goodly number were assembled. They have made an arrangement that no meeting can begin in the Temperance Hall until half past eight o'clock. The Wesleyan Chapel is close by, and our meeting in the Temperance Hall did not begin until their meeting was closed. It was not a favorable time to hold the people, yet all listened with deep attention. I spoke under the auspices of the Temperance Band of Hope Society. We were not charged anything for the hall. The first of the week W.C.W. arrived, visited Bismarck, which is about eight miles from Hobart, held a meeting, and made arrangements for holding other meetings during the week.",
