    "word": "New fields are open in which all can test their calling by experimental effort in bringing souls out from darkness and error, and establishing them upon the platform of eternal truth. . . . The work of fitting a people in these last days for the coming of Christ, is a most sacred, solemn work, and calls for devoted, unselfish laborers. Those who have humility, faith, energy, perseverance, and decision, will find plenty to do in their Master's vineyard. There are responsible duties to be performed, which require earnestness and the exertion of all their energies. It is willing service that God accepts. If the truth we profess is of such infinite importance as to decide the destiny of souls, how careful should we be in its presentation. [\"TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH,\" VOL. III, PP. 48, 53, 54 56, 57, 51, 64 (FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1872).] \n                                                                           12",
