    "word": "Elder Olsen, I urge you to be of good courage. Have confidence in God. Carry every burden to Him. He can and will make you efficient, but you must have faith. Do not be depressed, do not mourn in secret because of the unfaithfulness of the watchmen on the walls of Zion. There is no call for despondency and misapprehension. Place yourself where the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness can shine into all the chambers of your mind and into the soul-temple. We are the light of the world, God says. He will make those who are faithful in the church radiant with the word of God. \n\n\n                                    -103- \n\nHis Spirit will be communicated to human instrumentalities, giving them light before which moral darkness must flee away.--Letter 43, 1890. (To O. A. Olsen, Dec. 15, 1890.)",
