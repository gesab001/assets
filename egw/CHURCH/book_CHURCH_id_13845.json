    "word": "The Word of God has signified that people must be raised up to stand in the end. This matter, and much more I shall read you before I leave the ground, shows that there is an inward working right among yourselves and the churches that must take place, and then the finances will be brought up, if there is no robbery toward God. There is robbery toward God now. Now bring this up; let the conscience be touched; let God work upon your minds; and you will see salvation in your midst.",
