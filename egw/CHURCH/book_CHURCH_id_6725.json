The history of God's dealings with his people in the past testifies that his Spirit is not poured out upon those who neglect or oppose the warnings sent them by his servants. And by the rule which Christ himself has given, \"Ye shall know them by their fruits,\" it is evident that these movements are not the work of the Spirit of God.",
