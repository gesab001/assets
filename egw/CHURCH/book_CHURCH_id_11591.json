    "word": "In Oakland, California, it seemed almost impossible to obtain a suitable place in which to worship. The church was poor, depending on their hands only, but they said that they would build. It was also the same with the San Francisco Church. Both houses were commenced, but they said, Where is the means? and asked Brother White if he could help them. The reply was: \"Yes, but I shall have to sell everything in order to do it.\" In this transaction we lost $1,700 in exchange, but we cared not for that, for we were helping the cause. The houses went up, and the one in Oakland has already proven too small, and it had to be sold and a larger one must take its place.",
