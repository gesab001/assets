    "word": "All unexpected to me, the superintendent of our church schools came from Chico a few months ago and urged Dores and Ella to come to Chico to take charge of the school there. The teacher had left, and those in charge of the school work wanted Dores and Ella May to engage in the work of teaching until the close of the term. We wished them both to engage in the work of teaching, for Ella May had taught before, and her work had given much satisfaction. So we decided, as both had been teachers, that they could work together nicely. They have now been teaching for three months, and the school is increasing in numbers. Ella teaches the younger children, and Dores the older ones. All the parents feel well satisfied with their work. There is a church of our people in Chico, and both Ella and Dores take an active part in church work.",
