    "word": "Everything is to be shaken that can be shaken, and those things that cannot be shaken will remain. You will hear men talking of competition. \"He is not treated as he should have been,\" they say. \"Others have taken an advantage of him.\" But the trouble is with themselves. Constant perseverance in the right direction will give anyone standing place. Rational effort in cooperation with Christ means success and victory. These fluctuating, blustering men are represented in our institutions and in our churches. But they are not the Lord's chosen workmen when men are called for to be depended on. [Isaiah 50:2, 3, quoted.]",
