    "word": "May 27 [Friday]. We arrived at Vohwinkel about three o'clock. We were met by a brother, the elder of the church. We took a lunch and drove about two miles into the country. Here we found our brethren were living in a pleasant location. They have felt the oppression of landlords and have been wisely preparing, as far as possible, to have little homes of their own. There are in small houses no less than three families in a dwelling. A brother owns the home and rents to Sabbathkeepers. Brother Conradi spoke Friday evening. I spoke Sabbath morning [May 28] at 10:00 a.m. from the words in the prayer of Christ, that His disciples may be one as He was one with the Father. Then Brother Conradi told me they had never had a social meeting. They had met together for prayer but not to bear testimony. We thought it a favorable time \n\n\n                                    -123- \n\nto break them in, and our meeting was good, lasting three hours from its commencement.",
