    "word": "The students who have given their hearts to the Lord are to be prepared to go forth as workers for Him. They are members of His family. It is His desire that everything about the school shall be neat and orderly. Nothing is to be left to go at loose ends. Special evangelistic work is to be done for those students who enter the school unconverted. There should be a church school for the younger ones. Before all is to be kept the thought that Christ is their Saviour, that they are called and chosen by Him. Strict discipline will be needed, and this can be secured by faithful instruction.",
