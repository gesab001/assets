    "word": "Are there any of the church who are not easy to be entreated, who will argue for their own way, who will, in self-confidence, hold to their own ideas and not give them up, but will talk as though they were the only ones whose ways were perfect and unquestionable? These are not easily entreated because they are not converted. They are not divested of self. They are full of self-esteem, and are sure to disgust unbelievers with their words and ways, in talking the objectionable features of our faith, in all proud boasting and self-confidence. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" \"And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\"",
