    "word": "The tithe-money must be kept sacred. There are ministers who receive nothing for their labor; for there was no money to pay them. This I saw would be; for the management is wrong. Let every member of the church deny himself in dress, at the table, in house furniture, in carpets, in many things that are enjoyable, but not a necessity. There are souls to be saved. Can you be called workers together with Christ, can you be wearing his yoke, and yet your indulgence be cutting off the supplies of God's house? I was permitted to hear your faithless bemoaning of \"the hard times.\" You should deny yourselves in many ways, and be thankful for that which you have. Talk no more your unbelief. If the brethren in responsible positions would talk faith and courage to all the workers in the Office, if you would talk self-denial in the church, if you would practise it in your own families, if you would bear a clean-cut testimony, which you have not borne, if you would all be mouthpieces for God, and present to the church the necessity for self-denial, the humiliation of the soul, praying for the Lord to forgive your pride, your foolish, senseless vanity, the Lord may pass by, and leave you a blessing.",
