The apostle Paul declared, even in his day, \u201cThe mystery of iniquity doth already work.\u201d [2 Thessalonians 2:7.] During the lives of the apostles the church remained comparatively pure. \u201cBut toward the latter end of the second century most of the churches assumed a new form, the first simplicity disappeared; and insensibly, as the old disciples retired to their graves, their \n385\nchildren, along with new converts . . . came forward and new-modeled the cause.\u201d [ROBINSON, IN HISTORY OF BAPTISM.] To secure converts, the exalted standard of the Christian faith was lowered, and as the result \u201ca pagan flood, flowing into the church, carried with it its customs, practices, and idols.\u201d [GAVAZZI'S LECTURES, P. 290.] As the Christian religion secured the favor and support of secular rulers, it was nominally accepted by multitudes; but while in appearance Christians, many \u201cremained in substance pagans, especially worshiping in secret their idols.\u201d [GAVAZZI'S LECTURES, P. 290.]",
