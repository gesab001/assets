    "word": "BUT THERE'S A SECOND REASON FOR DAILY SPIRITUAL HELP. A CHURCH WITH HIGH IDEALS FOR ITS YOUNG NECESSARILY HAS HIGH STANDARDS. NOW, IF HIGH OR RIGOROUS STANDARDS ARE LEFT UNEXPLAINED, IF THEY AREN'T IMAGINATIVELY ADAPTED TO A CHILD'S DAILY ROUTINE, THEY QUICKLY BECOME BURDENSOME AND OPPRESSIVE TO A YOUNG PERSON. AND A CHILD MAY OBEY FOR A WHILE. HE MAY ATTEMPT TO PLEASE A PARENT OR A TEACHER OR A PASTOR, BUT IF HE DOES SO WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM FOR THE CHURCH'S STANDARDS AND IDEALS, HE IS SUBTLY DEVELOPING THE CHARACTER OF A REBEL. IN ANOTHER PLACE ELLEN WHITE WARNS, \u201cA SULLEN SUBMISSION TO THE WILL OF THE FATHER WILL DEVELOP THE CHARACTER OF A \n51\nREBEL. THE SERVICE IS LOOKED UPON BY SUCH A ONE IN THE LIGHT OF DRUDGERY. IT IS NOT RENDERED CHEERFULLY AND IN THE LOVE OF GOD. IT IS A MERE MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE.\u201d\u2014\u201cTHAT I MAY KNOW HIM,\u201d P. 120.",
