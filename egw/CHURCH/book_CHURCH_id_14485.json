    "word": "Facts are facts, and will appear thus in the judgment. The Old Testament contains the very principles specified by the voice of \"I AM\" in His education and discipline of the children of Israel. He was the invisible leader of the host of Israel. He gave principles which should govern the dealings of man with his fellow man. Every principle which is ignored by our institutions, by the church, in their dealing with one another will be presented before them, when every man shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body.",
