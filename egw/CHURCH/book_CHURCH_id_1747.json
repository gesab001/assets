    "word": "I have been reading the Review this morning. It is full of precious matter. This paper should be in every family of our people, not only in America, but in every country. It is our church paper for the world. I shall endeavor to obtain subscribers for it in America and Australia. I do not disparage the Signs of the Times. Both the Review and the Signs should be widely circulated. And I hope the subscription list of the Watchman may be greatly increased. I hope you will endeavor to obtain subscriptions for the Watchman and for the Review, for these papers contain important matter for this time. --Letter 93, 1905.",
