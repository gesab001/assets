    "word": "You are not to set such an example that women will feel at liberty to tell you the grievances of their home life, and to draw upon your sympathies. When a woman comes to you with her troubles, tell her plainly to go to her sisters, to tell her troubles to the deaconesses of the church. Tell her that she is out of place in opening her troubles to any man, for men are easily beguiled and tempted. Tell the one who has thrown her case upon you that God \n\n\n                                     -98- \n\nhas not placed this burden upon any man. You are not wise to take these burdens upon yourself. It is not your appointed work.",
