    "word": "This is the position that Satan now occupies toward every church, and toward the ministers of the gospel. He stands before the angel of God to resist them in their official work, the ministry of the Word, to resist the Lord's working in behalf of His people. In answer to the intercession and in pity toward His afflicted people, the Lord had come to their relief. \n     [Zechariah 2:1-10, quoted.]",
