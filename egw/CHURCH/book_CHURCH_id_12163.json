    "word": "Christ loved the church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water through the Word. His prayer for the believers is: \n\n\n          Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall \n     believe on Me through their word; That they all may be one; as Thou, \n     Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us: \n     That the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory \n     which Thou gavest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as \n     We are one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect \n     in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast \n     loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.--John 17:20-23.",
