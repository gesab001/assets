    "word": "The love of God in the heart of the teacher is valuable in the home, in the church, and in schoolwork in all its lines. The work is to be entered into with earnestness. The children and youth are to understand that their rule of action is the Word of God, and not human inventions. There must be obedience to what God has enjoined. An instructor is not prepared to mold minds or fashion characters unless Christ is abiding in his heart, unless he is learning Christ's ways and walking in His footsteps.--Letter 117, 1898, pp. 1-5. (To Frederick Griggs, Dec. 1, 1898.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 31, 1983",
