    "word": "MR No. 678 - Sister Caro's Ministerial Work\n\n     Sister Caro Very Capable Woman.--Sister Caro is a superior dentist. She has all the work she can do. She is a tall stately woman, but sociable and companionable. You would love her if you should see her. She does not hoard her means, she puts it into bags which wax not old. She handles an immense amount of money, and she uses the money to educate young men to become laborers for the Master. I am greatly attached to her. She holds her diploma as dentist and her credentials as minister. [MRS. CARO IS LISTED IN THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST YEARBOOK FOR 1894, P. 7, AS MINISTERIAL \"LICENTIATE.\"] She speaks to the church when there is no minister, so you see that she is a very capable woman. Her husband is a physician and surgeon.-- Letter 33, 1893, p. 2. (To Jennie L. Ings, Sept. 26, 1893.)",
