    "word": "I cannot rest because of the many representations made to me, showing that our people are in danger of losing precious opportunities of working earnestly and wisely for the proclamation of the third angel's message. Satan with all his agencies is working to hold God's people back from giving all their powers to His service. But as a people we are to be active and decidedly in earnest, improving every opportunity to increase our usefulness in religious lines. We are to be \"not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" Possessing true godliness and knowledge of the Word of God, every church member may become a working agency, laboring with dignity and confidence, yet with humble dependence, remembering the words of Christ to His first disciples, \"I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\" We need to exercise wisdom in all our ways if we would work in the name and fear of God. Unfeigned faith is what we need, for faith is \"the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\"",
