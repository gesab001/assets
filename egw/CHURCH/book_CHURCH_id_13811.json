    "word": "Norwich, Connecticut, Wednesday, December 3, 1890 \n\n     I visited Brother Appley's family, about one-half mile out, and it seemed like home to us. It commenced snowing in the morning and continued until the ground was covered with its white blanket. Brother Greer kindly took us with his horse and carriage to the place. Rain set in and it was a very disagreeable evening, but I had an appointment at the church. The rain poured from the heavens. Sister Greer loaned me her rubber ulster. The slush and water were so deep it went over my rubbers and it was dangerous, slippery walking, because of the ice upon the rocks leading into the church. Sara fell as she was leaving the church. The lantern flew out of her hand, and the globe came off and rolled down in the gutter. She struck her head on the steps and it made her faint and \n\n\n                                    -36- \n\ndizzy. Brother Farman came out to deliver a telegram which was to go to Battle Creek and he fell, but was not injured much. We thank the Lord that these two escaped without further injury.",
