    "word": "Those who are in training for work in the Cause in any line, should improve every opportunity to work at the camp-meeting. Wherever camp-meetings are held, young men who have received an education in medical missionary lines should feel it their duty to act a part. They should be encouraged not only to work in medical lines, but also to speak upon the points of present truth, giving the reasons why we are Seventh-day Adventists. These young men given an opportunity to work with older ministers, will receive much help and blessing. There is something for every one to do. Every soul that believes the Truth is to stand in his lot and place, saying \"Here am I, Lord; send me.\" By engaging in work at the camp-meeting, all may be learning how to work more successfully in their home churches.",
