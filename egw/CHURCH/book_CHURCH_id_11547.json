    "word": "London is an important point, and throughout England the cities are not to be neglected. God will move upon agents, God will work, and his power will be revealed if men will co-operate with Him. Where are the men, where are the women, who will give themselves entirely to the work? We need the converting power of God every day. Old habits of precision, of moving in a certain groove, will have to be changed; old customs and habits, that have long been cherished and idolized, will have to be broken up. Men will have to experience a daily conversion, in order that they may be working agents, who can be molded and fashioned as clay is molded and fashioned by the hands of the potter. Workers are to learn daily lessons in the school of Christ; for it is not your mold that God would have upon the characters of the church members. Give God a chance to impress minds, and to place His mold upon the character, and upon the church.",
