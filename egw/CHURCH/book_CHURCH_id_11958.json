    "word": "THE WORLD IS DOING A GREAT WORK FOR THE CHILDREN THROUGH KINDERGARTENS. IN PLACES WHERE WE HAVE INSTITUTIONS, AND BOTH PARENTS ARE EMPLOYED, THEY WOULD GLADLY SEND CHILDREN TO A KINDERGARTEN. I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT IN MANY OF OUR CHURCHES A KINDERGARTEN PROPERLY CONDUCTED FOR A FEW HOURS A DAY, WOULD BE A GREAT BLESSING. I HAVE NOT FOUND ANYTHING IN YOUR TEACHINGS OR RULINGS, MOTHER, OR ADVICE TO OUR PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE CONTRARY TO IT. BUT THE RULINGS OF OUR SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS HAS KILLED, COMPLETELY KILLED, IN MOST PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ANY EFFORT TOWARD PROVIDING KINDERGARTEN WORK FOR OUR CHILDREN.",
