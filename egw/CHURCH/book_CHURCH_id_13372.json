    "word": "My brother, you have thought that you were laboring in the interests \n\n                                     -96- \n\nof the church, but you were not doing so, for you were not walking softly and humbly before God. You do not have wisdom from above; you are not walking closely with God. You do not discern that the kind of labor that you are giving the church is not the kind of which it stands in need. You have had an experience in a kind of work that does not tend to encourage devotion or cultivate piety, or make you spiritually minded, that you may understand the way of the Lord and enable you to work for the best interests of the church.",
