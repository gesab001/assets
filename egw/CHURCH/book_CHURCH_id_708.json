    "word": "The Cost of Sharp Devising--Let us remember that variance and sharp dealing never serve the cause to enrich God's institutions.  By His providences God takes away the money gained by sharp devices.  Always by sharp practice dissatisfaction and disunion are created.  Lack of confidence comes in.  There is a constant impression that someone is trying to get the best of someone else in trade.  There are those who try to make terms that are not just and righteous, because they think they can do this, and they will do it.  Let the wrong principles which have been coming in for years now be cut out by the roots.  Let brotherly love prevail.  Those who think by sharp practice and worldly policy to get gain for the cause do not glorify God.  He will not accept a jot or tittle of such offerings.  God hates all such demonstrations.--Manuscript 16, 1901, p. 14 (Feb. 25, 1901 Testimony to the Battle Creek Church).",
