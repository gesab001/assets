    "word": "Brn. Waggoner and Cornell added greatly to his burdens, because of their manifest lack of judgment and the Spirit of God to unite with their efforts in seeking to settle church trials. They frequently left things in a worse condition than they found them. They were not calculated to deal with minds of every stamp. They let their own peculiar feelings control them. Both had victories to gain over self before they could labor successfully to set things in order in the churches. I was shown that neither of these brethren were calculated to build up the churches; but to sow dissension and divide, rather than to unite.",
