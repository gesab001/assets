    "word": "South Lancaster, Friday, October 24, 1890 \n\n     Rain commenced in the night and continued all day. I see notwithstanding the rain the people are coming in from Connecticut and Nashua. The church was full of people in the afternoon. I tried to speak to them from John 15 on the relation of the branch to the vine. The atmosphere was very heavy and lifeless and it seemed impossible for all the people to keep awake. We called for them to rise up and sing and yet there was an oppression in the atmosphere in the room.",
