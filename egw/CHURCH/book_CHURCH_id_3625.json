    "word": "There is a work to be done by our churches that few have any idea of. \u201cI was an hungered,\u201d Christ said, \u201cand ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me \n42\ndrink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye clothed Me: I was sick, and ye visited Me: I was in prison, and ye came unto Me.\u201d Matthew 25:35, 36. We shall have to give of our means to support laborers in the harvest field, and we shall rejoice in the sheaves gathered in. But while this is right, there is a work as yet untouched, that must be done. The mission of Christ was to heal the sick, encourage the hopeless, bind up the brokenhearted. This work of restoration is to be carried on among the needy suffering ones of humanity.",
