    "word": "There is spiritual life for every church member. We all need to apply the Word of God most earnestly to ourselves. We need to live in a higher, purer atmosphere. If we have the faith that works by love and purifies the soul, we shall be partakers of the divine nature. Then we shall have spirit and life and health. When the Word of God is brought into the daily life, there will be spiritual soundness. The powers of the soul will be exercised unto righteousness and godliness. Christ will dwell in our hearts by faith, and the presence of His Spirit will be revealed by a healthy spiritual growth.--Letter 123, 1904, pp. 3, 7. (To Edson White, March 29, 1904.)",
