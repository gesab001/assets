    "word": "Christ said, \"I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.\" We should do very much more to carry the light into \"regions beyond\" that sinners may be converted to the truth.

Because of the abundance of privileges that have been given them they have not valued them as they should, or appropriated the truth to their souls as they should. Had the \n\n\n                                   -201- \n\npeople had less instruction, and had unbelievers had a great deal more, it would have been more after the order of God. The living testimony should have been borne, and regular organized efforts should have been made in every church, and persons should have been set to work for those who are unbelievers. Christian growth is promoted by active work for others.",
