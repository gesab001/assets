    "word": "I now ask the members of our churches in the California Conference to help us raise the money to purchase this desirable property, and to furnish the school home with good but simple furniture. Shall we not seek to make this school a school after the Lord's order? We ask you not to let this opportunity pass by of making this school what the Lord would have it. We need your help, that this school may be secured to us, and manned with wise, well-balanced teachers. We believe that our brethren will help at this time. We cannot afford to delay the matter; it must be settled at once, if we would secure the property. I send you this invitation to help in this emergency. If the brethren and sisters will act a part in this work, the Lord will bless them in doing it.",
