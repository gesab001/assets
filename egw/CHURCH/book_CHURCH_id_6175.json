    "word": "When Jesus began His public ministry, He cleansed the temple from its sacrilegious profanation. Among the last acts of His ministry was the second cleansing of the temple. So in the last work for the warning of the world, two distinct calls are made to the churches. The second angel's message is, \"Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\" And in the loud cry of the third angel's message a voice is heard from heaven saying, \"Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities\" (RH Dec. 6, 1892).",
