    "word": "Sins of the most revolting character exist in the church today. The alarming situation of the people of God requires more than tame, spiritless, Christless, sermons to cut through the fleshy tablets of the heart, and to arouse the moral sensibility. Satan is appealing to the lowest propensities of human nature. But these do not need cultivation, like thistles and briers, selfishness, self-love, envying, jealousy, evil surmisings, self-esteem, will grow up luxuriantly if only left to themselves. But the highest, noblest faculties need to be kept in exercise that they may be developed. Christians who are overcoming day by day, who are seeking the glory of God and His approbation, will be careful not only to avoid wrong, but continually to perform what is right.",
