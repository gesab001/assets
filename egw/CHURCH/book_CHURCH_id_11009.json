    "word": "The Office is located in the center of a large church, and if even a portion of the church make free to call at the Office as they have done, when it suits their convenience, and chat upon subjects as they choose, they steal minutes and hours of precious time, which belong to the cause and work of God. In thus doing, they rob God. And this is not all, but they do their part in lessening the sacredness of the work in the Office, and make that which they should seek to preserve as sacred, common.",
