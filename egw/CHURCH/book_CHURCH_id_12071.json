    "word": "The Lord has a people in our churches in America, and they have become, some of them, discouraged and confused. But talk the truth. The third angel's message is to go forth with power, and will pierce the moral darkness black as velvet. . . . Walk with Jesus, talk with Jesus, and then you have light and comfort and love and power from your best Friend. Oh, it is such a privilege: \"Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" (John 4:14.) We need more faith. The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness will disperse every dark cloud. May the Lord Jesus abundantly bless you, my brother and my sister. I miss you very much; but remain until your work is done; then we will welcome you back again, for there is a large work for you to do. How comforting it is to know that we do not need to stumble our way along in midnight darkness. Light is sown for the righteous, and truth and gladness for the upright in heart.--Letter 218, 1899, p. 4. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, November 29, 1899.)",
