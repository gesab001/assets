    "word": "Again and again Christ had been asked to decide legal and political questions; but He refused to interfere in temporal matters. . . . He stood in our world as the Head of the great spiritual kingdom that He came to our world to establish,--the kingdom of righteousness. His teaching made plain the ennobling, sanctifying principles that govern this kingdom. He showed that justice and mercy and love are the controlling powers in Jehovah's kingdom.-- \"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. IX, page 218. \n\n\n                                               [397]",
