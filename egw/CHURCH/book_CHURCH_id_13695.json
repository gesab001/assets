    "word": "The church needs men today who, like Enoch, walk with God, revealing Christ to the world. Church members need to reach a higher standard. Heavenly messengers are waiting to communicate with men who have sunk self out of sight, whose lives are a fulfilling of the words, \"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.\" Of such men and women must the church be composed before her light can shine forth to the world in clear, distinct rays.",
