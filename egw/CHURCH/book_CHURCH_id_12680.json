    "word": "God brings His people together in church fellowship that they may better impart to the world the blessings of light which they receive from Him. There is no need of an education in criticism. All should strive to be true missionaries, encouraging and sustaining one another by speaking words of encouragement and hope, lifting up the hands which hang down, and strengthening the feeble knees. Each is to work according to his ability. \n\n\n                                -409- \n\nBut even after they have done their best, God's people will not feel a sense of self-congratulation. The true worker always feels a sense of abasement, of dissatisfaction with self. Humility is the fruit borne on the Christian tree.",
