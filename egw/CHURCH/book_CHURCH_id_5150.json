    "word": "PUBLIC PRAYER IS IMPORTANT BUT NOT SUFFICIENT BY ITSELF.\u2014Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient. Secret prayer is very important; in solitude the soul is laid bare to the inspecting eye of God, and every motive is scrutinized. Secret prayer! How precious! The soul communing with God! Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God. No curious ear is to receive the burden of such petitions.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, 189, 190).",
