    "word": "In a vision given me while at Saratoga Springs, I was shown a company in Vermont, with a female among them who was a deceiver, and the church must be enlightened as to her character, lest poisonous error should become deeply rooted among them. I had not seen with my natural eyes the brethren in that part of the State. We visited them, and as we entered Bro. B.'s dwelling a female came forward to receive me, whom I thought to be Sr. B.'s mother. I was about to salute her when the light fell upon her face, and lo! it was Mrs. C., the woman I had seen in vision. I dropped her hand instantly, and drew back. She noticed this, and remarked upon it afterwards. The church in Vergennes and vicinity collected together for meeting. There was confusion of sentiment. Bro. E. E. believed the Age to Come, and some were in favor of S. Allen, a notable fanatic, who held views of a dangerous character, which if carried out would lead to spiritual union and breaking up of families. We delivered the message which the Lord had given us.",
