    "word": "\"As we do this work, we shall find that means will flow into our treasuries, and we shall have means with which to carry on a still broader and more far-reaching work. Shall we not advance in faith, just as if we had thousands of dollars? We do not have half faith enough. Let us do our part in warning these cities. The warning message must come to the people who are ready to perish, unwarned, unsaved. How can we delay? As we advance, the means will come. But we must advance by faith, trusting in the Lord God of Israel.\" [FROM A MANUSCRIPT, PORTIONS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN \"TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH,\" VOL. 9. SEE PP. 98, 99.]",
