    "word": "My prayer is, O Lord, take the load of my mind, control my judgment, imbue me with Thy Spirit. In my very weakness I would glorify God. I would put my trust in Him; I would have sincere faith that works by love, and purifies the soul. We need to cultivate faith and love, for our churches are becoming leavened with unbelief, and with hardness of heart. We need to pray for the Lord to give them hearts of flesh.",
