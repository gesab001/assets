    "word": "And our camp-meetings have another object, preparatory to this. They are to promote spiritual life among our own people. The world in its wisdom knows not God.

The church has been constituted that channel. Christ reveals himself to us, that we may reveal him to others. Through his people are to be manifested all the riches and glory of his unspeakable gift.",
