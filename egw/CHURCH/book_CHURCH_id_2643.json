    "word": "Those who give instruction to children and youth should avoid tedious remarks. Short talks, right to the point, will have a happy influence. If there is much to be said, make up for brevity by frequency. A few interesting remarks, every now and then, will be more helpful than to give all the instruction at once. \n                                                                           209\nLong speeches tire the minds of the young. Too much talk will lead them even to loathe spiritual instruction, just as overeating burdens the stomach and lessens the appetite, leading to a loathing for food. Our instruction to the church, and especially to the youth, should be given line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. Children must be drawn toward heaven, not harshly, but very gently.",
