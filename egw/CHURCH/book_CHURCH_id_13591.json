    "word": "Elder Loughborough says those whom Barnes has had influence over are getting their eyes open. He wrote to the Marion paper that if a man could be sent here they would sweep in the whole of Milton church. That man will be with Barnes at the camp meeting, it is stated. We shall go straight ahead doing our work, and make no reference to these rebels. We hope to see the Lord at work in these meetings and great good done.",
