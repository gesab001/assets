    "word": "Let our churches beware of any effort made to draw our youth from their home churches to unite with an institution in order to wait upon worldlings. I call upon those in charge of our churches to beware. You are shepherds, set to watch over the sheep and lambs of Christ's flock. Our youth better far receive their education in a limited sphere than to go to Battle Creek. But because our youth should not go to Battle Creek, they are not to be bound about, so that they cannot develop. They should daily be given the highest motives to advance. They should attend our schools, and the teacher should work with them, and pray with them. They should leave these schools true medical missionaries firmly bound up with the gospel ministry.",
