W. Simpson \n\n\n     The Lord Jesus sent a mighty angel to make plain to John by the use of symbols the things that were to transpire until the coming of Christ. He was bidden to write the instruction in a book for the benefit of the seven churches. This writing we now have preserved in the book of Revelation, but this book is understood by only a very few. It contains the message for the last days, and we are to dwell much upon these prophecies.",
