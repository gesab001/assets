    "word": "PRAY AS NEVER BEFORE.\u2014Look unto Jesus in simplicity and faith. Gaze upon Jesus until the spirit faints under the excess of light. We do not half pray. We do not half believe. \u201cAsk, and it shall be given you.\u201d Luke 11:9. Pray, believe, strengthen one another. Pray as you never before prayed that the Lord will lay His hand upon you, that you may be able to comprehend the length and breadth and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ, \n29\nwhich passeth knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, 214.)",
