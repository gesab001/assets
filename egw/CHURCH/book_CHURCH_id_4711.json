    "word": "The true Christian abounds in good works; he brings forth much fruit. He feeds the hungry, clothes the naked, visits the sick, and ministers to the afflicted. Christians take a heartfelt interest in the children that are about them, who, through the subtle temptations of the enemy, are ready to perish. Fathers and mothers, if you have guarded your own children from the wiles of the foe, look about you to save the souls of the children who have not such care. . . . There are youth all around us to whom the members of the church owe a duty; for Christ has died for them. . . . They are precious in the sight of God, and He desires their eternal happiness. . . . Christ calls for voluntary cooperation on the part of His agents in doing earnest, consistent work for the salvation of souls.",
