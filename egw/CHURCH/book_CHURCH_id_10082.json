    "word": "To my ministering brethren I would say, Prosecute this work with tact and ability. Set to work the young men and the young women in our churches. Combine the medical missionary work with the proclamation of the third angel's message. Make regular, organized effort to lift the \n\n\n                    - 19 - \n\nchurches out of the dead level into which they have fallen, and have remained for years. Send into the churches workers who will set the principles of health reform in their connection with the third angel's message, before every family and individual. Encourage all to take a part in work for their fellow men, and see if the breath of life will not quickly return to these churches.",
