    "word": "Would it not be well for you to seek the Lord as the disciples sought Him before the day of Pentecost? After Christ's ascension, His disciples--men of varied talents and capabilities--assembled in an upper chamber to pray for the gift of the Holy Spirit. In this room \"all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication.\" They made thorough work of repentance by confessing their own sins. Upon them was laid no burden to confess one another's sins. Settling all differences and alienations, they were of one accord, and prayed with unity of purpose for ten days, at the end of which time \"they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\"--Letter 98, 1902, p. 3. (\"To the Churches and Companies in Greater New York,\" July 8, 1902.)",
