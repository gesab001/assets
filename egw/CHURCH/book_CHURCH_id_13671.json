    "word": "The Lord calls upon His workers to leave the ninety and nine in the fold of the church, and enter new districts. Some can do a most precious work in fireside labor. When sitting at the table to partake of food, they can witness for the Master. Christ sowed the seeds of truth wherever He was. The canvassers in the field, if they are consecrated to God, will learn every day by practice how to reach the souls for whom Christ has died.",
