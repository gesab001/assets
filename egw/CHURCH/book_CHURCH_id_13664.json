    "word": "An angel of God said, \"Look and observe carefully what this people are doing, mingling their own dross with pure truth.\" I had Sara present to report, and will not make the statement I designed to make, but have the words copied and then will have it more exact. Now, said I, I expect you may, some of you, consider my words as idle tales, but you must meet them in the judgment and I must meet them. I cannot abate one iota from their severity.

Next Monday--tomorrow evening--I meet the church and address them all.",
