Study prayerfully the 17th chapter of John. This chapter is not only to be read again and again. but its truths are to be eaten and digested. \"For \n\n\n                     -14- \n\ntheir sakes,\" Christ prayed, \"I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. . . . That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.\"",
