    "word": "The world in its wisdom knows not God; for the wisdom among men is not drawn from the great Source of all light and wisdom. The world cannot see the beauty, the loveliness, goodness, and holiness, of divine truth. And in order that men may understand it, there must be a channel through which it shall come to the world. The Saviour has constituted the church that channel; for he has said, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" The professed follower of Christ is under the most solemn obligation to let his light shine that Jesus may be made manifest to the world. Christ has revealed himself to us that we may reveal him to others.",
