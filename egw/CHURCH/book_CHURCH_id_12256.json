    "word": "We are busily engaged in getting our letters ready to send to America. We had promised to visit Brother and Sister Holland, and after dinner today Elder [A. G.] Daniells, May, and I went to fill the appointment. Through the temptations of the enemy, Sister Holland has given up the truth. In this case we saw the results of unwise management. Elder H has not acted the part of a faithful shepherd. He preached to the people, but there his labors ended. He allowed matters of a temporal nature to absorb the time and attention that should have been given to souls. He did not minister to the needs of sinners, and as a result, several of the church members were tempted. He did not visit the believers when they were sick. When they were absent from church, he did not inquire into the matter. For nearly a year and a half Sister Holland did not attend meetings, But Elder H did not visit her. He was told of her spiritual condition, but still he made no effort to help her. Brother Holland is still a member of the church, and we hope that his wife may be restored to the fold of Christ.--Manuscript 37, 1892, pp. 7, 8. (Diary, October 26, 1892.)",
