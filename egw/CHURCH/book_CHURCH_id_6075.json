    "word": "Paul rebukes the Corinthians for making the house of God a place of feasting and revelry, like a company of idolaters: \"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not?\" The public religious feasts of the Greeks had been conducted in this way, and it was by following the counsels of false teachers that the Christians had been led to imitate their example. These teachers had begun by assuring them that it was not wrong to attend idolatrous feasts, and had finally introduced similar practices into the Christian church.",
