    "word": "The Sabbath is to be exalted and made prominent more than is done now. Again the churches, the plants of the Lord, must take up experimental religious work, not only for the church members but for those whom their experience may benefit in personal labor. . . .They are to work for their neighbors whether believers or unbelievers. They may obtain the confidence of the suffering ones, and in offering prayer in their behalf, should pray that they may feel their accountability to God to serve Him who died to redeem them. The patient self-sacrifice of these church members should carry out the instruction of Christ to His disciples.",
