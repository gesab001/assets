    "word": "I left, I supposed, explicit orders with Brother_____to do this work of sending at least that which would in money be two or three dollars per week, and a box of flour, oil and such things as they have to buy, and pay very high for on the island. But I judge from Brother Belden's letter that nothing has been sent. I feel very sad over this. I gave $1,400 from my own resources at one time for the building of churches in Brisbane and in Hamilton and for the Health Retreat. Now this matter should be as just and right without any of the reasons I have written, but the matter for some reason has fallen through, and now, understanding the situation, I say send three dollars per week and let Brother Belden live and not be pressed for want of food. This is due them by the conference.--Letter 181, 1901, p. 2. (To Brother and Sister Burden, July 29, 1901.)",
