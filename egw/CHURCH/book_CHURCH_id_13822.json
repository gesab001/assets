Burke at the St. Helena Health Retreat \n\n\n     While at Salamanca, New York, in November, 1890, I had a very remarkable experience. I had been greatly afflicted and discouraged in consequence of physical suffering. The pain in my head and ears was almost unbearable, yet I filled my appointments. The last time I spoke, because of gatherings in my head I told my son I must return home at once, although important meetings were before me in Brooklyn, New York, and Washington, D.C. I could scarcely hear my own voice and was so weak I staggered as I walked. I went to my chamber and knelt to pray when the whole room was lighted up with the presence of Jesus. I was lifted above all discouragement and was made all light in the Lord and praised Him aloud. This night many things were opened before me in regard to our institutions. The condition of conferences and churches was shown me and I immediately [ELLEN WHITE MAY BE REFERRING TO HER NOVEMBER 25 ENTRY (SEE THE ENTRY UNDER THIS DATE, ABOVE), WHICH IS TRANSCRIBED FROM PP. 335-342 OF HER DIARY.] wrote out many things in my diary.",
