    "word": "MR No. 399a - Unity and Witness\n\n     In the plan of redemption a place is allotted to every soul and each one is to take the place assigned him and do the work appointed him. The work of God's people may and will be varied, but one Spirit is the mover in it all. God calls upon the members of His church to receive the Holy Spirit, to come together in unity and brotherly sympathy, to bind their interests together in love. Christian unity is a mighty agency.",
