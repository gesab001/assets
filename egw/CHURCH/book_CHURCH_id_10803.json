    "word": "I present this lesson to Nicodemus as highly applicable to those who today are in responsible positions as rulers in Israel, and whose voices are often heard in council, giving evidence of the spirit that Nicodemus possessed. The words of Christ are spoken just as verily to presidents of conferences, elders of churches, and those occupying responsible positions in our churches, \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Will the lesson given to the chief ruler have the same influence on their hearts and lives as it had on his? \n\n\n                      -46-",
