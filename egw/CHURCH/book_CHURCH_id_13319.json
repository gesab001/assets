    "word": "MR No. 1396 - The Case of Hiram Rich\n\n            (Written January, 1861, at Battle Creek, Michigan.) \n\n     I was shown the case of Hiram Rich; I was pointed back in the past and shown the lack of principle he possessed. He is a stranger to true honor. A blot, a heavy blot, was upon his life, upon his past course. His past life was corrupt. He separated man and wife, and shamefully gave himself up to his corrupt desire, and brought a blot upon his name and life which would forever follow him and exclude him from ever holding any office in the church or taking an exalted position there.",
