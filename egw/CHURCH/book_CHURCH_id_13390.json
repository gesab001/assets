    "word": "MR No. 1457 - N. D. Faulkhead's Break With the Masons; Need for a House of Worship in Melbourne\n\n     (Written May 7, 1895, from Glenorchy, Tasmania to O .A. Olsen.) \n\n     Since making New South Wales our home, which it has been for something over year, our labors have not been of a meager order. We have had abundant work in visiting the churches, in ministering to the poor, in speaking and writing on important themes. The interest in Ashfield and Petersham has been deepening, and the opposition has been increasing. For some time I have been speaking in Ashfield and Petersham on Sabbath and Sunday evenings, and have felt deeply interested in these places. But when an urgent request was made that I visit Tasmania and attend the convention that was about to be held in Hobart, though I was reluctant to leave these interests, yet I dared not refuse to go. The boat that goes from here to Hobart was not regarded as unobjectionable, and our brethren would not consent that I should be a passenger on this boat.",
