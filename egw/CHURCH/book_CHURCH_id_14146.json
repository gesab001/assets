    "word": "Do not men know from the Word of God, that just such a message as has lately been going to the churches, must be given in order that the very work which has been going on among us might be accomplished? Some who ought to have been first to catch the heavenly inspiration of truth, have been directly opposed to the message of God. They have been doing all that was in their power to show contempt for both the message and the messenger, and Jesus could not do many mighty works because of their unbelief. However, truth will move on, passing by those who despise and reject it. Although apparently \n                                                                           421\nretarded, it cannot be extinguished. When the message of God meets with opposition, He gives it additional force that it may exert greater influence. Endowed with vital, heavenly energy, it will cut its way through the thickest barriers, dispel darkness, refute error, gain conquests, and triumph over every obstacle.

Those who would triumph in the truth, will have to act a part in the sight of the universe which will bring to them the reward of \"well done.\" They will be known as laborers together with God.",
