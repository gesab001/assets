    "word": "Work, O work, keeping eternity in view. Bear in mind that every power must be sanctified. In yourselves you are powerless to do anything good. Christ declares, \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" Becoming partakers of the divine nature you can do all things. Through Christ you can have power with God and with men. A great work is to be done. Let the prayer go forth from unfeigned lips, \"God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause His face to shine upon us; that Thy way may be known upon the earth, Thy saving health among all nations.\" Our God is waiting to be gracious. \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\" Will the church give to the world the light of the knowledge of Jesus Christ? Shall the light shine forth to all nations, kindreds, tongues and peoples?",
