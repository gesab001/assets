    "word": "All Should be Workers \n\n     Not one of the workers in the office is excused from being a worker in the church of God. \n                                                                           33\nThose who are capable of engaging in labor in the office are capable of being workers in the church. There is missionary work to be done everywhere. Everyone in the office who professes the name of Christ should be put into regular, systematic labor of some kind in the church. Every man and woman is required of God to do something for the advancement of His cause. Every institution like the publishing house on the Pacific Coast should have rules and discipline, requiring those who work in the office to be earnest workers in the church. If there is a neglect in attending evening meetings or the meetings on the Sabbath, it should be inquired into, and if valid reasons are not given, they should be urged or admonished to attend these meetings, so essential to their spiritual strength. Without this spiritual strength the influence of these laborers will not be good, and the religious tone in the office will not be correct. Those who profess to be engaged in the sacred work of God should not excuse the neglect of the service of God because of their own work. Such work can be laid aside much better than the service of God, for His strength and grace are every day essential for the performance of daily duties, and the opportunities and privileges for spiritual strength can not be slighted or neglected without backsliding from God. Backsliders are not wanted to engage in the sacred work of God.",
