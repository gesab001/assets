We were given wonderful \n\n\n                                    -342- \n\nmanifestations of the power of God. Miracles were wrought. Again and again, when we were brought into strait places, the power of God was displayed in our behalf. At such times, souls were convicted, and amidst the scorn and derision of the opposing churches, they bore testimony in favor of the truth. \"So mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed.\" Under the preaching of the truth, men were converted, and were \"instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, spake and taught diligently the great things of the Lord.\"",
