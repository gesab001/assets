    "word": "Along the Rhine\n     We leave Cologne in the early morning. The weather during the entire homeward journey is bright and sunny, and we have a good opportunity to see the country. From this place to Bingen our route lies through the far-famed highlands of the Rhine. The scenery is grand and picturesque, and in summer it must be beautiful beyond description. The railroad lies close to the river bank, the track winding around the mountains, and affording a fine view of the river all the way. On each side there are mountains, here sloping gradually to the shore, there rising abruptly from the water's edge. Palaces and towers are scattered everywhere on the river bank, adorning every commanding position along the shores. From almost every rocky crag or mountain summit an ancient castle or ruined arch looks down upon the smiling valley. The mountains are terraced and covered with vineyards, and steep, zigzag paths lead up their sides, to the watchtowers and pavilions on the pinnacles of the rocks, or far up to the towers and castles that crown the summit. On the hills and in the valleys are groves, orchards, and gardens; and nestled at the foot of the mountains, or clinging to the steep hillsides, may be seen the villages of the peasants, a grey old church lifting its spire from some elevated site above the little hamlet. On each side of the river are the road and the railroad track, the train on the opposite bank dashing along as if in strife with ours, and often disappearing from view as it darts through some mountain tunnel. Close beside us flows the beautiful Rhine, as still and smooth as glass, and upon its quiet bosom little steamers are gliding up and down.",
