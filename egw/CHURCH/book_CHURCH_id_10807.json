    "word": "Solemn Appeal. \n\n     There is a work to be done in the churches. A different testimony must go forth. I am terribly alarmed. Throughout the churches there are selfishness and sin, dishonesty, unbelief, criticism and fault-finding. It is high time to awake out of sleep. You who have long lost the spirit of prayer, pray, pray earnestly. Pity thy suffering cause; pity the church, pity the individual believers, thou Father of mercies. Take from us everything that defiles, deny us what thou wilt; but take not from us thy Holy Spirit.",
