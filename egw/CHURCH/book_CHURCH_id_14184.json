    "word": "I was almost hopeless in reference to expecting a general breaking up of the soul under the influence of the Spirit and power of God. I was weary, O so weary. Thursday I was sick. Did not sit up much. I was unnerved, and could not do any writing. Friday morning I was sick; did not attend meeting in the morning. I was exhausted all day. I was asked to speak Sabbath but had not the strength. I sent word for Brother [Dan] Jones to invite Elder Waggoner to speak. There seemed to be a little reluctance, but finally he was invited and gave a most precious discourse on the message to the Laodicean church,--just what was needed. This was another rich blessing to the church.",
