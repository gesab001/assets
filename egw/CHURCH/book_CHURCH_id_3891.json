    "word": "The Lost Condemn Their False Shepherds \n\n     Church members who have seen the light and been convicted, but who have trusted the salvation of their souls to the minister, will learn in the day of God that no other soul can pay the ransom for their transgression. A terrible cry will be raised, \"I am lost, eternally lost.\" Men will feel as though they could rend in pieces the ministers who have preached falsehoods and condemned the truth.--4BC 1157 (1900).",
