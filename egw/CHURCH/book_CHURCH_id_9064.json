    "word": "There are many who have not a clear, distinct understanding of the relation of man to his fellow-man in the work of God. The members of God's church stand in close relation to one another. All are to use their entrusted capabilities in His service, that each may minister to the perfection of the whole. Each is to work under the supervision of God. By Christ's wonderful union of divinity with humanity, we are assured that even in this world we may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.",
