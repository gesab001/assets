    "word": "Speaking to Ministers and Groups of Other Denominations\nYou may have opportunity to speak in other churches. In improving these opportunities, remember the words of the Saviour, \"Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\" Do not arouse the malignity of the enemy by making denunciatory speeches. Thus you will close doors against the entrance of truth. Clear-cut messages are to be borne. But guard against arousing antagonism. There are many souls to be saved. Restrain all harsh expressions. In word and deed be wise unto salvation, representing Christ to all with whom you come in contact. Let all see that your feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and good will to men. Wonderful are the results we shall see if we enter into the work imbued with the Spirit of Christ. Help will come in our necessity if we carry the work forward in righteousness, mercy, and love. Truth will triumph, and bear away the victory.  Ev 563, 564560",
