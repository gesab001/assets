    "word": "Family's Appearance\n \n\n     Shun the idolatry of dress. God wants beautiful character, not stylish appearance.--Ministers and ministers' wives should be an example in reproving the fashionable display in our sisters who claim to believe the truth. They should have their children dressed in a way that God would approve, presenting them to the church in simplicity, and modesty of apparel. Far greater pains should be taken to instruct them so that they shall have beautiful characters and keep the way of the Lord than to have them make a stylish appearance, taking the way of the Sodomites.--Testimonies on the Case of Elder E. P. Daniels (Ph 96) 15.",
