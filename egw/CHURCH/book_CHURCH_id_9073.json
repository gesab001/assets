    "word": "I address every church member. Open the door of the heart and let Christ into the soul. I address every labourer: Put on Christ. In this will lie your greatest triumph.

There is revealed too little deep insight into the situation and real necessities of the Lord's blood-bought heritage. Souls have cost too much for us to be careless and indifferent in regard to them.",
