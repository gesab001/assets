    "word": "Among our people in America, . . . there is a great lack of the missionary spirit among those who can labor in the German, the French, and other languages. How can you who have received the truth, feel so little burden for those of your own tongue in other countries? Is your interest selfishly shut up to your own family or to your own church? God pity your narrowness! You should have that undying zeal, that far-reaching love, that encircles the world. There are hundreds of millions of men, women, and children who have never heard the truth, and \n                                                                           32\nmultitudes are constantly going down to the grave without any sense of their accountability to God. How can you who repeat the Lord's prayer, \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven,\" sit at ease in your homes without helping to carry the torch of truth to others? How can you lift up your hands before God and ask His blessing upon yourselves and your families, when you are doing so little to help others? . . .",
