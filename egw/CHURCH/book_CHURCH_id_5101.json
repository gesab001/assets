    "word": "All who occupy responsible positions need to learn the lesson that is taught in Solomon\u2019s humble prayer. They are ever to remember that position will never change the character or render man infallible. The higher the position a man occupies, the greater the responsibility he has to bear, the wider will be the influence he exerts and the greater his need to feel his dependence on the wisdom and strength of God and to cultivate the best and most holy character.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, 281, 282).",
