    "word": "Nor is it best to erect buildings for old men and old women, that they may be in a company together.  Let them be helped in the very places where they can be helped.  Let relations take care of their own poor relations, and let the church take care of its own needy members.  This is the very work God would have the church do, and they will obtain a blessing in doing it.  -- WM 238.",
