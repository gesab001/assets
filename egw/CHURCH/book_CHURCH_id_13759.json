    "word": "To Invent New Plans \n     The cause of God today needs men who will first commune with God to learn their duty, and will then go forth to do what He commands irrespective of the bribes or threats of those who would bear rule over them. Men are needed who are guided by the Lord, and whom God qualifies to give to the people a plain \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Men are needed who pray to God for wisdom, and who under the guidance of God, can put new life into the old methods of labor, and can invent new plans and new methods of awakening the interest of church members and reaching the men and women of the world. . . . \n                                                                           34",
