    "word": "The apostle counsels his Corinthian brethren, \u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God. Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.\u201d \u201cFor though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.\u201d \u201cTo the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.\u201d [1 Corinthians 10:31-33; 9:19, 22.] \u201cWe then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification. For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, \n256\nThe reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.\u201d [Romans 15:1-3.]\u2014 Vol. 2, p. 673.",
