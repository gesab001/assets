    "word": "Rebuke Sometimes Necessary \n     Holiness to God through Christ is required of Christians. If there are wrongs in the church, they should receive immediate attention. Some may have to be sharply rebuked. This is not doing the erring one any wrong. The faithful physician of the soul cuts deep, that no pestilent matter may be left to burst forth again. After the reproof has been given, then comes repentance and confession, and God will freely pardon and heal. He always pardons when confession is made.--Manuscript 130, 1899, p. 8. (Written September 8, 1899, \"The Test of Obedience.\") \n\n\n                               -167-",
