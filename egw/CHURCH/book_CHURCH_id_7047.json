    "word": "I saw that duties were laid down for us in God's word, to be performed to keep the people of God humble and separate from the world, and from backsliding, like the nominal churches. Washing feet, and the Lord's supper should be more frequently practiced. Jesus set us the example, and told us to do as he had done. I saw that the example of Christ should be as exactly followed as possible; yet brethren and sisters have not always moved as judiciously as they should in washing feet, and confusion has been caused. It should be introduced into new places with carefulness and wisdom, especially where the people are not informed relative to the example and teachings of our Lord on this point, and where they have prejudice against it. Many honest souls are much prejudiced against this plain duty, through the influence of their former teachers in whom they had confidence; and the subject should be introduced to them in a proper time and manner.",
