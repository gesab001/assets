Let them keep their bond of union unbroken, pressing together in love and unity, encouraging one another to advance, each gaining courage and strength from the assistance of the others. . . . As they work and pray in Christ\u2019s name, their numbers will increase.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, 21.)",
