    "word": "The time is coming when every entrusted talent must be accounted for. The Lord has put into our keeping talents that we are to improve by wise investment. We are to increase and sustain the facilities for God's worship, not by sociables, fairs, raffles, games, lotteries, or any such means. When money is obtained in this way to sustain the church, it is because the church members are self-indulgent, gratifying pride and appetite by using wine, beer, liquor, and tobacco. Thousands of dollars are expended in needless things, while the poor are suffering for food and clothing, and the cause of God is left to makeshift to secure means to supply its numerous necessities.",
