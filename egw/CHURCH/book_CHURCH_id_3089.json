    "word": "What nation of the New World was in 1798 rising into power, giving promise of strength and greatness, and attracting the attention of the world? The application of the symbol admits of no question. One nation, and only one, meets the specifications of this prophecy; it points unmistakably to the United States of America. Again and again the thought, almost the exact words, of the sacred writer have been unconsciously employed by the orator and the historian in describing the rise and growth of this nation. The beast was seen \u201ccoming up out of the earth;\u201d and, according to the translators, the word here rendered \u201ccoming up\u201d literally signifies to \u201cgrow or spring up as a plant.\u201d And, as we have seen, the nation must arise in territory previously unoccupied. A prominent writer, describing the rise of the United States, speaks of \u201cthe mystery of her coming forth from vacancy,\u201d and says, \u201cLike a silent seed we grew into empire.\u201d [TOWNSEND, IN \u201cTHE NEW WORLD COMPARED WITH THE OLD,\u201d P. 462.] A European journal in 1850 \n441\nspoke of the United States as a wonderful empire, which was \u201cemerging,\u201d and \u201camid the silence of the earth daily adding to its power and pride.\u201d [THE DUBLIN NATION.] Edward Everett, in an oration on the Pilgrim founders of this nation, said: \u201cDid they look for a retired spot, inoffensive from its obscurity, safe in its remoteness from the haunts of despots, where the little church of Leyden might enjoy freedom of conscience? Behold the mighty regions over which, in peaceful conquest, . . . they have borne the banners of the cross.\u201d",
