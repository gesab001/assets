    "word": "I spoke several times before the large congregation gathered in the Oakland church. The second Sabbath I was in doubt as to the advisability of attempting to speak, as I had contracted a severe cold. But I dared not remain at home, so I said, I will place myself in a position to speak, and then, if I am unable, I will be humble enough to refrain from speaking. I found the church crowded. To the praise of God, upheld and sustained by His power, I was enabled to speak for an hour and a quarter. Some who for forty years have frequently heard me speak said they had never before heard me give so powerful a discourse. No one could doubt that the power of God rested upon me.",
