    "word": "Medical missionary work is a sacred thing of God's own devising. After Adam's transgression a costly price was paid to rescue the fallen race. Those who will cooperate with God in His effort to save, working on the lines on which Christ worked, will be wholly successful. The church is charged to convey to the world, without delay, God's saving mercy. We are not to cover mercy with selfishness and then call it medical missionary work.",
