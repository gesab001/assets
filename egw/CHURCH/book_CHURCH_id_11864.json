    "word": "This personal effort is that which the people must have. Heart must be brought close to heart and in every soul we have to see one whom Christ died to save. This work is not pleasant to all, but it is a work that is to be done, and it is essential in the formation and building up of a church and in educating you to become able ministers. . . . Many love to preach but they do not love to minister; but this is the work which is really more essential than preaching alone. There is to be practical instruction given in regard to the daily Christian life and duty. We are to present in our own life patience, meekness and forbearance, long-suffering and cheerfulness, joyfulness in the truth,--but not a love for controversy. . . .",
