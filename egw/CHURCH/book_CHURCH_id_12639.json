    "word": "Christ gave His life to save sinners, and He says to His people,\"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" Shall we do nothing but try to keep the churches together? Shall we leave those in darkness to perish? It is doing the churches great harm to treat them as though their salvation depended on the sermons of our ministers. Every church member should be actively engaged in the service of the Master to bring souls to Christ.",
