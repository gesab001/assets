    "word": "During the year the people are largely occupied with temporal, earthly things; and when they assemble in the yearly convocations, they need to change the current of their thoughts. Many have a knowledge of the theory of the truth, but know little of its practical bearing upon character and life. And as our camp-meetings have been conducted, the people often return to their homes no better qualified to work for God in their families and churches than before they came. There is a great dearth of the Spirit and power of God because the subject of personal piety, true faith, and heart holiness is not kept before the mind in its real importance. Business activities in a religious line satisfy the consciences of \n224\nmany, while their hearts are destitute of the tender love, the compassion for one another, that dwelt in the bosom of Christ.",
