    "word": "The Word specifies the gifts and graces that are essential for every soul who receives the truth. But especially does the Lord require His messengers, who carry His Word to others, to live the truth, to reveal that they are sanctified through the truth. If they do not show their love of the truth by meeting the infallible standard, let them step out from the ministry and no longer dishonor God by their disorderly course of action. Let close, critical examination be made of the tenor of their life and action. Have they the marks that testify that they are children of God, that they apply the Word of God as a test of their own qualification to do service that will properly represent Christ? Have they shown a clear understanding, a right judgment in the things of God? Have they a sweet, pure, clean spirit in the sight of God, in the home and in the church? Do they give evidence that they are undefiled, that they can labor to help others out of Satan's power, or do they show a want of sincere piety and conscientious scruples in willing toil, failing to lift burdens for Christ? Do they give evidence that day by day they are learning the meekness and lowliness of Christ?",
