    "word": "Among the assistants of Paul in his labors were many of his former companions and fellow-workers. Luke, \"the beloved physician,\" who had attended him in the journey to Jerusalem, through the two years' imprisonment at Caesarea, and upon his last perilous voyage, was with him still. Timothy also ministered to his comfort. Tychicus was his mail-bearer, taking his messages to the different churches which they had visited together. Demas and Mark also were with him.",
