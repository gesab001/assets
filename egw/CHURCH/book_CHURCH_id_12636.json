    "word": "Too much has been centralized in Battle Creek. Broader plans should have been laid. The work should have been extended, not centralized. Plants should have been made in other cities. These warnings the Lord has been giving for years. An influence in accordance with our Saviour's words, \"And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me,\" should have been exerted. The influence of the Battle Creek church is not what it should be. Whatever the moral condition of the world may be, the church is to stand forth in purity and true godliness. When the church stands thus, the gospel will have a transforming influence upon the outside world.",
