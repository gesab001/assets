    "word": "A Faithful Work in the Churches \n     There has been work you ought to have done, that you have not done: To preach the truth everywhere just as it is, pleasant or unpleasant. To impress upon the churches and individuals their God-given responsibilities in tithes and offerings, in selling and giving alms; impressing them that God had entrusted them with means that must be used to advance His work, that they were handling the Lord's money.",
