    "word": "Christ declares that there will exist similar unbelief  concerning his second coming. As the people of Noah's day \u201cknew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so,\u201d in the words of our Saviour, \u201cshall also the coming of the Son of man be.\u201d [Matthew 24:39.] When the professed people of God are uniting with the world, living as they live, and joining with them in forbidden pleasure; when the luxury of the world becomes the luxury of the church; when the marriage bells are chiming, and all are looking forward to many years of worldly prosperity,\u2014then, suddenly as the lightning flashes from the heavens, will come the end of their bright visions and delusive hopes.",
