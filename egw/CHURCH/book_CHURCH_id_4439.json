    "word": "Religion and Health \n\n     \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" When men of wrong habits and sinful practices yield to the power of divine truth, the entrance of God's word gives light and understanding to the simple. There is an application of truth to the heart; and moral power, which seemed to have been paralyzed, revives. The receiver is possessed of stronger, clearer understanding than before. He has riveted his soul to the Eternal Rock. Health improves, in the very sense of his security in Christ. Thus religion and the laws of health go hand in hand.--Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. 4, p. 553. \n\n(246)",
