    "word": "The spirit of contention that some have revealed, has greatly retarded the progress of the Lord's work. We are all to unify on the proper basis of unity. God has pointed out the results of certain actions that can never be sanctioned by His servants; and notwithstanding, these plain messages of warning and entreaty, the same acts of wrong-doing have been persistently repeated. This course can not long be passed over in silence; for I have been instructed by the Lord that the people have a right to know and understand that for the past twenty years God in His mercy has been giving to our physician-in-chief light that has never been given to the churches. This light has shone upon our brother's pathway, in order that he might be prevented from pursuing a course that God could not approve and bless.",
