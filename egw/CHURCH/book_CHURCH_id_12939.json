    "word": "The overthrow of Brother Y was his own set, stubborn will--his unwillingness to be influenced by the judgment of the church. The first great evil was the lack of family government. Sister Y was at fault here. She has too often indulged and put her children forward, and her husband corrected the children in passion, yet the interference of Sister Y made matters worse. She was too indulgent. Both were indulgent, and when the church felt compelled to move and cut off those who were only a curse, both Brother and Sister Y rebelled. The course the church pursued should have been carried out at an earlier date. Such trash, such clogs, should quickly be cut off from God's people. The church should move with judgment and discretion, but these cases are too plain to need delay.",
