    "word": "Chap. 9 - To Our Churches Where Institutions are Located.\n\n\n                   St. Helena, Cal., Nov. 21, 1902. \n     Lately my mind has been drawn to the work that needs to be done for our people. Things have been revealed to me that make me afraid. The One of authority declared: \"Seventh-day Adventists are on losing ground in every place where they have established institutions; and the reason for this is that they have lost their first love. Let them remember from whence they have fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else God will come to them quickly, and will remove their candlestick out of his place, except they repent.\"",
