    "word": "There is far too little of self-denial and self-sacrifice among those who claim church fellowship; far too little confession of sin. Church members need to be reconverted, and sanctified in soul, body, and spirit, if they would increase in faith, and grow in grace. But an unsanctified course of action has so long been followed, that the church should now be alarmed. The power of the Holy Spirit, so much needed on the human heart, is not felt. Many who profess to believe and receive the Word of God are deceived; they are not practicing the truth. They are not following on to know the Lord, that they may know that His going forth is prepared as the morning.--Ms 141, 1907, p. 3.
