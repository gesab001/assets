    "word": "\"Have Root in Yourselves\" \n\n     Let the people of God have root in themselves, because they are planted in Jesus Christ. There must be no strife for supremacy. Let everyone seek God for himself, and know for himself that the truth of God is the sanctifier of soul, life, and character. Service to God is an individual responsibility. Let all feel that it is their duty and privilege to bear their testimony in the church, speaking of those things which will edify. No one should try to sermonize. No one should speak in a way that savors in the least of self-exaltation, or raise questions that will cause dissension. Let each one present lessons from the life of Christ, and reveal none of self but all of Jesus.",
