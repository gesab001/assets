    "word": "Church members cannot honor God till they arise and shine because the glory of the Lord has risen upon them. I appeal to every church member to inquire, \"Is my name written in the books of heaven?\" There are those who, unless they are thoroughly converted, will crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put Him to open shame. This age is one of peculiar temptation, especially to the self-sufficient ones, who feel no special need of guarding the avenues of the soul. Unless they heed the warnings God has given, they will most surely be drawn away from the principles of the truth. They will stand among those who dishonor the faith and give heed to seducing spirits. They plead for indulgence of appetite. They enjoy those things which animalize the nature. They do not know what it means to be meek and lowly in heart. They take no delight in contemplating the character of the Saviour. The rebuke of Christ is upon them because in thought and action they are corrupt.",
