    "word": "If men and women would acknowledge the true Sabbath, they would not as they now do despise the word of God. The observance of the seventh day would be a golden chain binding them to their Creator. But the commandment which points out who the true God is--the Creator and Ruler of the earth--is dishonored and disobeyed. This is the reason why there is so little stability in the world. The churches have refused God's sign and misrepresented His character. They have torn down God's sacred rest day, exalting a spurious sabbath in its place. Oh, that men would cease to lock themselves out of heaven by their own perversities.--Ms 28, 1900, p. 10, 11. (\"Obedience or Disobedience,\" typed May 10, 1900.)",
