    "word": "Paul wrote of the churches in Macedonia: \"in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift.\" Shall not this be the testimony borne of our people at this time? \n                           Ellen G.
