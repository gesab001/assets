    "word": "Work for the Colored People \n\n     There is now to be a decided work done for the neglected colored people in this country, where they were so long kept in slavery. Here we are surrounded by Christian churches, benevolent institutions, and educational institutions for the benefit of our own race, and these have proved a great blessing in shedding abroad the light of the regenerating power of Christianity. We need now more schools and colleges where the colored people can obtain a Christian education.",
