    "word": "Through His servant Isaiah God is calling His church to appreciate her exalted privilege in having the wisdom of the Infinite at her demand: \"O, Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength, lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God: (404) Behold the Lord will come with a strong hand and His arm shall rule for Him. He shall feed His flock like a shepherd: He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young. (Isaiah 40:12-17, 28-31)",
