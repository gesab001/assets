    "word": "May the Lord give you wisdom, and give wisdom to all who are teaching the truth to others in Biblical institutes, or in any other place, that they may know how to communicate that which they have learned to perishing souls. If those who have heard the precious truth, which has been spoken in the demonstration of the Spirit, will lay hold upon God by living faith, and be vitalized by His Holy Spirit, and take up the work right where they are, lifting up Jesus before their own family that all may behold Him, they will do the very work that God calls upon them to do. Those who take up their home responsibilities, will also trade upon the Lord's goods by extending their efforts into the neighborhood and into the church. They will increase in tact and wisdom; for the Holy Spirit will cooperate with a willing, God-fearing, humble worker.",
