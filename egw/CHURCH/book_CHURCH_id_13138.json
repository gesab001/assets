    "word": "MR No. 1269 - Every Person Has God-Given Talents Which Should Bear Fruit; Church Leaders Not to Exercise Absolute Control Over Others\n\n     (Written May 11, 1896, from Granville, Sydney, NSW, \"To My Brethren in Battle Creek.\") \n\n\n     All secret working is open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do. To handle men as if they were machinery, binding their freedom by methods and terms, is an offense which God will not tolerate. This work cannot be done without imperiling souls. But too often men seek to harness men, and drive them as horses are driven. Right principles are perverted by selfishness and covetousness, which is pronounced by God to be idolatry. It is easy for men who suppose their power to be unlimited, to follow the guidance of their own spirit, and make propositions and decisions that turn the work out of the straightforward channels in which God designs it shall travel, into crooked paths. But because a man is in a position at the heart of the work, where he thinks no one would dare to say to him, \"Why do ye so wickedly?\" he should not seek to rule as a lord over God's heritage.",
