    "word": "The great mistake of those who minister in word and doctrine has been in failing to consider that God works in His church as well as with the preacher. They must see in the individual members those whom God has selected as His chosen ones, to do a work in well-matured, thoughtful labor for the saving of the souls of those who are in the darkness of error. The ministers must give ample encouragement. Then there will be less contention, less striving for the mastery to secure the highest places where they will become leaders. . . .",
