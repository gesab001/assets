    "word": "The whole chapter shows that Babylon that has fallen are the churches who will not receive the messages of warning the Lord has given in the first, second, and third angel's messages. They refused the truth and accepted a lie. They refused the messages of truth. See 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12. The message in the 18th of Revelation is plain and clearly defined. Verse 3: \"For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.\" Anyone who reads this chapter need not be deceived.",
