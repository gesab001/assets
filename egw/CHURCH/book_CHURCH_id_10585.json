    "word": "Jesus continued: \"And I say also unto thee, \n                                                                           66\nThat thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" The word Peter signifies rolling stone. Christ did not refer to Peter as being the rock upon which he would found his church. His expression, \"this rock,\" applied to himself as the foundation of the Christian church. In Isaiah 28:16, the same reference is made: \"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion, for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation.\" It is the same stone to which reference is made in Luke 20:17, 18: \"And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\" Also in Mark 12:10, 11: \"And have ye not read this scripture, The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?\"",
