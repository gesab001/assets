    "word": "[PORTION\nOF AN APPEAL FOR A CHURCH SCHOOL TO SERVE\nTHE SANITARIUM [DEER PARK], CALIFORNIA,\nCHURCH, MONDAY MORNING, JULY 14, 1902.]\n-\n\n     I promised that I would speak this morning in regard to the necessity of withdrawing our children from the public schools, and of providing suitable places where they can be educated aright. I have felt surprised at the apparently indifferent attitude of some, notwithstanding the oft-repeated warnings given that parents must provide for their families not merely with reference to their present interests, but especially with reference to their future, eternal interests. The characters that we form in this life are to decide our destiny. If we choose, we may live a life that measures with the life of God.",
