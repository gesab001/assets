    "word": "There are some Sabbathkeepers who make a god of their bellies. They waste their means in obtaining rich food. Such, I saw, if saved at all, will know what pinching want is unless they deny their appetites and eat to the glory of God. There are but few who eat to the glory of God. How can those who have cake and pie crust filled with grease ask God's blessing upon it and then eat with an eye single to God's glory? We are commanded to do all to the glory of God. We must eat and drink to His glory.--Ms 3, 1854, pp. 8-10. (\"Testimony for Churches in New York State,\" February 12, 1854.)",
