    "word": "We are less excusable than were the Jews; for we have before us their example of rejection of Christ and His apostles, and we have been warned not to fall after the same example of unbelief. Throughout the history of the church in all ages, and especially in that of the Seventh-day Adventists, we have examples of those who have refused the light God sent them by His chosen agents. They have had opportunities and privileges that should have enabled their faith to rest on God, and yet they have revealed the evil heart of unbelief. Their course has been similar to that of Pharaoh. The light that the Lord sent to the king of Egypt was spurned and rejected by him. His stubborn heart caused him to brace himself against the light.",
