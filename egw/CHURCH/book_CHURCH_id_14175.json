    "word": "When Nathanael came to Jesus, Jesus exclaimed, \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\" Nathanael said, \"Whence knowest thou me?\" Jesus answered, \"When thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.\" And Jesus will see us also in the secret places of prayer, if we seek him for light that we may know what is truth. Our brethren should be willing to investigate in a candid way every point of controversy. \n                                                                           548\nIf a brother is teaching error, those who are in responsible positions ought to know it; and if he is teaching truth, they ought to take their stand at his side. We should all know what is being taught among us, for if it is truth, we need to know it. The Sabbath-school teacher needs to know it, and every Sabbath-school scholar ought to understand it. We are all under obligation to God to know what he sends to us. He has given directions by which we may test every doctrine,--\"To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\" But if it is according to this test, do not be so full of prejudice that you cannot acknowledge a point when it is proved to you, simply because it does not agree with your ideas. Do not catch at every objection, however small, and make it as large as possible, and preserve it for future use. No one has said that we shall find perfection in any man's investigations, but this I do know, that our churches are dying for the want of teaching on the subject of righteousness by faith in Christ, and for kindred truths.",
