    "word": "Opportunities \n\n     All can labor for the salvation of those who are out of the ark of safety. When church members stand pledged to the service of God, pledged to do missionary work, when they take hold of the work unselfishly because they love the souls for whom Christ has died and are desirous of uniting with the great Medical Missionary, the Lord will come very near to them to instruct them. Life is full of opportunities for practical missionaries. Every man, woman, and child can sow each day the seeds of kind words and unselfish deeds.",
