    "word": "\"In our largest churches the greatest evils exist because these have had the greatest light. They have not a true knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom he has sent. The leaven of unbelief is working, and unless these evils which bring the displeasure of God are corrected in its members, the whole church stands accountable for them. The deep movings of the Spirit of God are not with them. Many come to the assembly as worshippers like a door upon its hinges. They understand not the true application of the Scriptures nor the power of God. They have eyes but they see not; ears have they but they hear not; they continue in their evil ways yet regard themselves as the privileged obedient people, who are doers of the word. A carnal security and ease in Zion prevail. Peace, peace, is sounded in her borders when God has not spoken peace. They have forfeited the terms of peace; there is reason for an alarm to be sounded in all my holy mountain. The sinners in Zion should be afraid; in a time when they do not expect it, sudden destruction will surely come upon all who are at ease.",
