    "word": "I was strengthened to speak seventeen times, once in the Theatre Royal, and had a good hearing, and this removed a great deal of prejudice, and we had a good attendance from outside. After the tent was taken down, I spoke twice in the Adventist church, a neat commodious building. The Sunday after the camp-meeting we had an appointment for Hastings, a town fourteen miles from Napier. Hastings, a small town, is situated in one of the best farming districts of New Zealand. Hastings is a little inland, and is more sheltered from the sea breezes than Napier is. When camp-meeting was first proposed for New Zealand, they thought Hastings the place, but finally decided to have it as Napier because more of our people live there. The ride from Napier to Hastings was very pleasant, the road was as level as the floor, so to speak, and several miles of it near the sea side. I spoke in the theatre to a good congregation who listened with deepest interest. This discourse was well received. There are but very few Sabbath-keepers there, four I believe.",
