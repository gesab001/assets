    "word": "The Eastern Camp Meetings \n\n     When we arrived at the camp ground at Groveland, Mass., we found an excellent meeting in progress. There were forty-seven tents on the ground, besides three large tents, the one for the congregation being 80 x 125 feet in dimensions. The meetings on the Sabbath were of the deepest interest. The church was revived and strengthened, while sinners and backsliders were aroused to a sense of their danger.",
