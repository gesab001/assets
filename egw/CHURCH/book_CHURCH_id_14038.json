    "word": "We knew that work had to be done for the Fresno church before they could see the impression they were making on the public mind. They were building walls that would make the truth of none effect to those to whom it should be presented. I was praying earnestly when Elder Daniels was laboring in Fresno that the Lord would work through his servant to his own name's glory. If the Lord has laid on Elder Daniels a work to do for the church, let those for whom he labored, not look to the instrument, but to God who works through him. The Lord sent Gideon to do a special work, and he said to Gideon, \"Go in this thy might.\" He directed Gideon to the strength that was back of his own strength, as if he said to Gideon, I have chosen thee to do an errand for me, in this I have regarded thee graciously, and let this be encouragement, because thou hast found grace in the eyes of the Lord. Go in thy strength and conquer. We were glad that the fruits of the work in Fresno bore evidence that God was dealing with human \n                                                                           63\nminds. The Lord wrought upon hearts. Humble confessions were made and the work of restitution that was done, bore witness to the genuineness of the work. It may be that some did not bring forth the fruits of thorough repentance. There was some close, testing work to be done if the plough share of truth went deep enough to break up the fallow ground of the heart. The testimony of many, was, \"I have never seen it on this wise before.\" The evidence was of a character that no one could doubt but that the work was of God. Confessions of sins were made, and like Zacchaeus, souls were impressed to say, \"If I have taken aught from any man, I will restore him four fold.\" This work of making things right as far as human power could, was in the order of God.",
