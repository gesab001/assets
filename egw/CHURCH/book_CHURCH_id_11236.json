    "word": "Let us endeavor, then, to carry forward the grand and glorious work of lifting the indebtedness from the schools, without calling our regular canvassers away from the sale of the precious books they are handling. Let us encourage students who have not made a record as successful canvassers to fit themselves to do acceptable work for the schools during vacations.

Let us then work diligently to fulfill this expectation.",
