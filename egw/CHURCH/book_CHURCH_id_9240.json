    "word": "The church is to work actively as an organized body to spread abroad the influence of the cross of Christ. Those who work unselfishly to give the truth to those nigh and afar off are registered in the courts above, \"Laborers together with God; . . . God's husbandry, . . . God's building.\" Controlled by the great Designer, they show what human beings can be when they wear the yoke of Christ, learning His meekness and lowliness.",
