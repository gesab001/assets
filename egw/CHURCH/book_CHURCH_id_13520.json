    "word": "Shall we have to say of our churches in ________, and especially of the oldest church, the _______ church, it is dark itself, and cannot diffuse light; it is cold at heart, and has no overflowing and subduing influence to pour out upon the lost? With all its members, that church is weak, and for the service of Christ, worthless. It is a dark church that cannot shine. Have its members done despite to the Spirit of God? I fear greatly that were Christ on earth today, He would say, \"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.\"",
