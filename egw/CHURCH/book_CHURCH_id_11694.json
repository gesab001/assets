    "word": "Christ loved the church, \"and gave Himself for it, that He might . . . cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that He might present it to Himself . . . [without] spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be . . . without blemish. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself, . . . but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: for we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.\" \n\n\n                                     -381-",
