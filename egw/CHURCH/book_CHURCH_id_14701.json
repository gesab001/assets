    "word": "God has instructed me to say to conference presidents and to ministers. Teach every church in the Conference to look to God for an understanding of present truth and duty. The Lord has not placed upon presidents or ministers the responsibilities of the position that He alone, as head of His church, can occupy. Church and conference organization do not give man any such responsibility.",
