    "word": "Brother K has not been a blessing to the church in -----, but a great burden. He has stood directly in the way of their advancement. He has not been in a condition to help when and where they needed help the most. He has not correctly represented our faith; his conversation and life have not been unto holiness. He has been far behind, and has not been ready or willing to discern the leadings of God's providence. He has stood in the way of sinners; he has not been in such a position that his influence would recommend our faith to unbelievers.",
