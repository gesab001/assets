    "word": "MR No. 1330 - The Need of Earnest Effort; Work the Cities;\nHeed the Message to Laodicea\n\n     We are living in the time of the end. Thrones and churches have united to oppose God's purposes. The association of man with man, which God designed should be a means of strengthening goodness and happiness, has been a means of strengthening evil and of developing tendencies to rebellion. Men have assumed despotic power, and human laws have been put in the place of the law of God.",
