White\n\n                     INTRODUCTION \n\n                                               -\n \n\n\n     MUCH OF ELLEN WHITE'S LIFE WAS SPENT PREPARING BOOKS THAT CARRIED THE MESSAGES GOD GAVE HER FOR HIS PEOPLE AND IN SOME INSTANCES TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE WHITE ESTATE FILES CONTAIN RELATIVELY FEW OF HER STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE DETAILS OF THIS WORK. HOWEVER, OTHERS WORKING WITH HER WROTE MORE FULLY. HER RELATIVELY FEW STATEMENTS, HOWEVER, DO TAKE US INTO THE VERY HEART OF HER WORK. WE PRESENT HERE SOME OF THESE STATEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE PREPARATION AND PUBLICATION OF THE TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH AND CERTAIN OF HER BOOKS THAT PRESENT THE CONFLICT OF THE AGES STORY, PARTICULARLY THE GREAT CONTROVERSY AND THE DESIRE OF AGES.",
