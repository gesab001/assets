    "word": "The church in Battle Creek could not flourish in carrying out this precise system. Brn. Waggoner and Andrews failed in some respects in their management in church matters at Battle Creek. They moved too much in their own spirit, and did not make God their whole dependence. They did not, as they should, lead the church to God, the fountain of living waters, at which they could supply their want, and satisfy their soul-hunger. The renewing, sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit, to give peace and hope to the troubled conscience, and restore health and happiness to the soul, was not made of the highest importance. The good object they had in view was not attained. These brethren had too much of a spirit of cold criticism in the examination of individuals who presented themselves to be received into the church. The spirit of weeping with those who weep, and rejoicing with those who rejoice, was not in the hearts of these ministering brethren as it should have been.",
