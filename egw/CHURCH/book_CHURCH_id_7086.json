    "word": "Presenting Temperance at Salem, Oregon.--On Sunday, June 23 [1873], I spoke in the Methodist church of Salem [Oregon], on the subject of temperance. The attendance was unusually good, and I had freedom in treating this, my favorite subject. I was requested to speak again in the same place on the Sunday following the camp meeting, but was prevented by hoarseness. On the next Tuesday evening, however, I again spoke in this church. Many invitations were tendered me to speak on temperance in various cities and towns of Oregon, but the state of my health forbade my complying with these requests.",
