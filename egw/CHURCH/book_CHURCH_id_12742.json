    "word": "The members of the San Diego church were very anxious to hear me, and I spoke to them the first Sunday after coming here, driving six miles there \n\n\n                                   -229- \n\nand six miles back. But I was so weak that my voice would not come to me, and I spoke for only 15 minutes. I should certainly have fainted in the stand had I remained longer. I had to give up, and have not tried to speak since. I have a beautiful, sunny room, but my cough does not seem to leave me. I think the dry atmosphere here affects me as it does in Colorado.",
