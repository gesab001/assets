    "word": "The last great day will be a triumph of law. The Lord is preparing for His last great work, and He will rise out of His place to punish the world for her iniquity. Then the earth will disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. Who will prepare to hold up a light amid the moral darkness that exists in our world. The wretchedness that has been accumulating for ages and that is degrading humanity, is not sensed as it should be. \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" is the command of God. Idolatry exists in the church-goers today as verily as in the days of Noah. But when His commands are obeyed, the human family will be elevated, ennobled, and exalted. \n\n\n                                              (Signed) E. G. White",
