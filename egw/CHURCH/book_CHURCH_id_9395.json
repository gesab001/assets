    "word": "The light that the Lord has given on this subject in His Word is plain, and leaders will be tested and tried in many ways to see if they will heed it. Every church, every family, needs to be instructed in regard to Christian temperance. All should know how to eat and drink in order to preserve health. We are amid the closing scenes of this world\u2019s history; and there should be harmonious action in the ranks of Sabbathkeepers. Those who stand aloof from the great work of instructing the people upon this question do not follow where the Great Physician leads the way. \u201cIf any man will come after me,\u201d Christ said, \u201clet him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\u201d (Matthew 16:24).",
