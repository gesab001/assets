    "word": "It is the duty of every church member to burn and shine, that the rays of light may be seen amid the moral darkness. I have not come to this part of Australia to devote my time and strength to keeping you in good spirit, and holding up you who know the truth. It is my mission to go to \"the regions beyond,\" to those who sit in darkness and have no light. Will you as a church help me? Will you hold up my hands? Will you have root in yourselves? Will you send your prayers as sharp sickles into the harvest field? Can I rely upon you who have had great light and many opportunities to help me in my labors?",
