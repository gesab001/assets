    "word": "My brethren and sisters, will you not heed this appeal? As it is read to the members of the several churches by the one who shall stand in my stead, because I cannot be with you personally, let the believers respond. Bow before God, and make confession of your backsliding. In humility accept the words of Christ, \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me\" [Matthew 16:24]. \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; \n\n\n                                    -238- \n\nfor I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" [Matthew 11:29, 30].",
