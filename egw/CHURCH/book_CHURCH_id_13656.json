    "word": "A few words more. If Christ is abiding in your hearts by faith, you will as a church have the presence of God. You will learn what it is to have the love of Christ in the heart for your brethren. You will learn how to exercise that love in your families and in the church--first pure, and then peaceable, and then easy to be entreated, full of righteousness and good fruits. As Christ prayed that the church might be one, you will all try to be one, to see eye to eye, and speak the same words, and have the same judgment, and that there be no divisions among you. You will be united, and Christ will be your strength.",
