    "word": "\"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, Jan. 12, 1898. \n\n     I am pleased that the Lord is in mercy again visiting the church. My heart trembles as I think of the many times he has come in, and his Holy Spirit has worked in the church; but after the immediate effect was over, the merciful dealings of God were forgotten. Pride, spiritual indifference, was the record made in heaven. Those who were visited by the rich mercy and grace of God dishonored their Redeemer by their unbelief.",
