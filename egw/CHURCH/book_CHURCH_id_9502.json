    "word": "I beseech the members of every church to seek now for the greatest blessing Heaven can bestow--the Holy Spirit. If in faith you seek for a greater measure of God's Spirit, you will be constantly taking it in and breathing it out. Daily you will receive a fresh supply. Your everyday experience will be enriched by the rich current of God's love. Before you lie vast fields of truth, vast sources of power. Let the daily prayer be, \"Take from us what Thou dost choose to take, but withhold not Thy Holy Spirit from us.\" We must have the gift of the Holy Spirit.",
