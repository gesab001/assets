    "word": "One week ago last Tuesday we returned home from visiting the churches in Switzerland. We traveled with our own horse and carriage and by thus doing obtained a view of the places and scenery of interest which we should not have done had we ridden on the cars. Switzerland is far ahead of Colorado for landscape scenes. The hills and mountains here are indescribably grand. I do not think I ever viewed scenery which made so deep an impression on my mind. It seemed as though my heart was lifted up to heaven as I viewed the works of God in nature. I could not refrain from saying, \"Great and marvelous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty.\" I looked upon the high rocks seamed by the mighty cataracts which had worn a channel through them, and at \n\n\n                                    -19- \n\nthe mountains towering toward heaven and then down hundreds of feet into the ravine through which a rapid stream was noisily beating its way over the stones and rugged rocks. I was filled with awe as I looked upon this scenery. I meditated upon the things which my eyes were beholding. How great was the living God who held and controlled these wonderful places of the earth, holding the mountains of stone in their place by His own hand, subject to His will. Oh, what power and what majesty has our God!  Himself is the Rock of Ages.",
