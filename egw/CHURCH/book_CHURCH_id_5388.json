    "word": "The church that Christ presents before the throne of His glory is without \"spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.\" Do you want to be among those who have washed their robes of character in the blood of the Lamb? then, \"cease to do evil; learn to do well\"; walk in the commandments and ordinances of your God blameless. You are not to ask whether it suits your convenience to keep the truth of heaven. You are to take up your cross and follow Jesus, cost what it may. You will find that His yoke is easy, and His burden is light.--Review and Herald, June 22, 1911.",
