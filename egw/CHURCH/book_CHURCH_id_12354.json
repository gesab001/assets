    "word": "MR No. 833 - Ellen White's Theology of Redemption\n\n     Comments on 2 Corinthians 3--The greatest difficulties Paul had to meet arose from the influence of Judaizing teachers. These had made much trouble and caused dissensions at Corinth. Paul is writing to the church in order to settle their minds in reference to the gospel of Christ. The Judaizing teachers were continually presenting the virtues of the law and the ceremonies, exalting these above the gospel of Christ, and bringing Paul under condemnation because he did not urge upon the people the ceremonies that typified Christ and were therefore of no value since Christ's death.",
