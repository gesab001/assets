    "word": "Church school teachers should be men and women who have a humble estimate of themselves, who are not full of vain conceit. They should be humble, faithful workers, filled with the true missionary spirit, workers who have learned to put their trust in God and to do their work in his name. They should possess the attributes of Christ's character - patience, kindness, mercy, and love; and into the daily experience they should bring the Saviour's righteousness and peace and grace. Then, working with fragrant influence, they will give evidence of what grace can do through the weakness of the human agents who make God their dependance and their trust.",
