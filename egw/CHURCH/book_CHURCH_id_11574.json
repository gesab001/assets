    "word": "Thursday, Jan. 6, 1859. Made a cap and a vest for Edson. At night am very weary. Gave Agnes a half-worn dress for her mother. They are poor. The husband and father is sick. Their crops have failed. They have breadstuff to buy and nothing to buy with. Agnes is their main support. She is only seventeen. There are four children now at home. They must suffer unless the church interest themselves in their behalf. May the Lord have mercy upon the needy. . . .",
