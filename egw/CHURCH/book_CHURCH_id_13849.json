    "word": "Religion is a personal matter. We are not saved by companies; we are not saved by having our names on the church books; we are not saved by numbers. The matter is, How is it with my soul? Have I made the surrender to God? Luke 10. Read the test made to Christ, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" Christ responds to the lawyer, \"What is written in the law? how readest thou?\" (Read the whole on this point.) Am I converted to God? Has His transforming power made me a new man? Am I kind? Have I the attributes of Christ, or the attributes of Satan? Am I polite to God whose property in souls I am responsible for? Am I kind? Am I patient? Am I tender? Do I have the love of Christ for the souls for whom He has died?",
