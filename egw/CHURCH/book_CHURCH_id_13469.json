    "word": "A great crisis is upon us, and all who stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince Emmanuel, girding themselves for the battle, will be led and taught of God. The world, with all its selfish projects, its burden of leaven of dishonesty and craftiness, its boasting and its desire for the supremacy, its neglect of the things of God, is not to receive our attention or our confidence. Upon all who have received light in regard to the truth for this time is laid the obligation of proclaiming the warning message. The labors of our ministers are not to be confined to the churches who have received the truth.",
