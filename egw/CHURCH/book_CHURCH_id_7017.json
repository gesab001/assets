    "word": "When the churches spurned the counsel of God by rejecting the advent message, the Lord rejected them. The first angel was followed by a second, proclaiming, \"Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\" Revelation 14:8. This message was understood by Adventists to be an announcement\n364\n365\nof the moral fall of the churches in consequence of their rejection of the first message. The proclamation, \"Babylon is fallen,\" was given in the summer of 1844, and as the result, about fifty thousand withdrew from these churches.",
