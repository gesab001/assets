    "word": "We are still in this world, where these barriers exist, and we must work in a way that will enable us to reach all classes. Let not the present obstructions worry you and destroy your faith and confidence in God. Let the believers in the South, both white and black, become, through the transforming grace of Christ, like the heavenly pattern. If the white church is to become a holy temple for God, the character building of the members must be after the character building of the meek and lowly Jesus. If the black man has given himself to God as His child, let him believe that he is just as precious in His sight as are His white children. He may lift his head toward the light and become a partaker of the divine nature. It is his privilege to reveal the character of Christ. By the divine presence, he may be transformed in heart and mind, and from him may radiate heaven\u2019s dazzling beams. Christ may shine forth from him the perfection of all righteousness. The glory of the Saviour is his defense.",
