    "word": "Leaving the first love represents a spiritual fall. Many have fallen thus. In every church in our land, there is needed confession, repentance, and reconversion. The disappointment of Christ is beyond description. Unless those who have fallen repent speedily, the deceptions of the last days will overtake them. Some, though they do not realize it, are preparing to be overtaken. Temptation comes suddenly, and the light is quenched. Henceforth light is to them darkness, and darkness light. God calls for repentance without delay. So long have many trifled with salvation that their spiritual eyesight is dimmed, and they cannot discern between light and darkness. Christ is humiliated in His people. The first love is gone; the faith is weak, there is need of a thorough transformation.",
