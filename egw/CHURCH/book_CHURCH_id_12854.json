    "word": "There has been too little personal labor done. When one becomes in any way disaffected, he begins to visit and talk with others, and impressions of a disagreeable and untruthful character are left upon the mind. Thus it is that much of the seed of irritation and evil-surmisings are sown, and the unity of the brethren and sisters is broken up. There is a great need of work to be done, that the churches may not become defiled. Let those persons who have no inclination to come out and be on the Lord's side be labored with, and if they cannot harmonize with the church, let them either keep their tongue as with a bridle, or find some other place to worship. Their influence of evil cannot have the sanction of the church or God's approval. This work has been strangely neglected. It is time to set the church in order.--Manuscript 52, 1898, pp. 17-19. (Written May 5, 1898, \"The Work Required of God's People.\") \n\n\n                                   -165-",
