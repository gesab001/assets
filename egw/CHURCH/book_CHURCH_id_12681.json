    "word": "Christ said, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" This commission comes from the lips of One who loves the world, not [merely] a few human beings.

She places herself where she cannot see the realization of the words, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\"",
