    "word": "My right hand is not sick. From the elbow of my right arm I can use my arm and hand. . . . I have a framework that is adjusted to my position of body, so that I can use my pen. I am able to have my rocking chair drawn from the bedroom to the parlor. My brethren come to me and . . . present to me special things to decide for them in church matters. They can all kneel but me.--Ms 30, 1892, pp. 1, 2. (Diary fragment, March 1, 1892.)",
