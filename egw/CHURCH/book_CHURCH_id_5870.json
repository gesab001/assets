    "word": "Condensation of First Ten Testimony Pamphlets Republished in 1864.--During the last nine years, from 1855 to 1864, I have written ten small pamphlets, entitled, Testimony for the Church, which have been published and circulated among Seventh-day Adventists. The first edition of most of these pamphlets being exhausted, and there being an increasing demand for them, it has been thought best to re-print them, as given in the following pages, omitting local and personal matters, and giving those portions only which are of practical and general interest and importance. Most of Testimony No. 4 may be found in the second volume of Spiritual Gifts, hence, it is omitted in this volume. [BY POPULAR DEMAND THE FIRST TEN WERE REPRINTED, IN 1874, IN FULL IN BOOK FORM, TOGETHER WITH A REPRINTING OF NUMBERS 11-20.--COMPILERS.]--Spiritual Gifts, vol. 4a, p. 2.",
