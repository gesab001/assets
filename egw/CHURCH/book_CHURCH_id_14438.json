    "word": "There are to be a large number who will attend the school from New Zealand, the coming term. I wish I could have a larger fund to draw upon, and send some young men and women who greatly desire to attend school. I can help a few and must let the rest wait. I am so sorry to do this but the Lord knows all about it. I believe he will put it into the hearts of his stewards to send us that which we need, workers and money to advance the cause in all its branches; but my special burden is for young men and women in this country to receive the advantages, Bible lessons, and religious instruction and become transformed in character. Never was a time when economy should be practiced as now. Satan is wide awake while men are sleeping who ought to be vigilant sentinels. Now is the time to work as never before. Christchurch, a large and beautiful city has never been entered. The same is true of many smaller places in New Zealand. Yet we hope these places will not be entered until the work can be done judiciously and with thoroughness. The Lord will surely work for His people in New Zealand.",
