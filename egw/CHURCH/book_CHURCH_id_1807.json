    "word": "Instruct in Practical Methods of Doing Missionary Work.--That which is needed now for the upbuilding of our churches is the nice work of wise laborers to discern and develop talent in the church that can be educated for the Master's service. Those who shall labor in visiting the churches should give them  instruction in the Bible reading and  missionary work. Let there be a class for the training of the youth who are willing to work if they are taught how. Young men and women should be educated to become workers at home, in their own neighborhoods, and in the church.--RH, May 15, 1888.",
