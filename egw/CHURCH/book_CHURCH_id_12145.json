    "word": "Every church should be staunch and true to the light God has given. Some justify their use of tea and of meat by saying that they have been in the habit of eating meat and drinking tea. But this is a great evil. He who thus tries to justify these practices is not walking in the light. Some try to live the truth but their habits are not brought into conformity with the will of God. Their appetites and passions bear away the victory, and the safeguards are broken down. How then will the church be prepared to help those newly come to the faith. They are far behind in the principles of health reform, and lead others in the same line.--Ms 49, 1898, p. 14.
