    "word": "MR No. 1556 - Church Leader to Be Self-Denying and Humble, Not Proud and Dictatorial\n\n     (Written January, 1901, from St. Helena, California, to Elder E.E. Franke.) \n\n\n     I am awakened this morning with a burden to write to you. I have a message for you from the Lord. At the present time you are in serious peril healthwise, and this involves more than you realize. You are becoming a religious dyspeptic. God sees that you are in danger of making shipwreck of the faith, and thus greatly dishonoring the Lord Jesus Christ who bought you with His own precious blood. If you will not heed counsel, you will be left to become the sport of Satan's temptations.",
