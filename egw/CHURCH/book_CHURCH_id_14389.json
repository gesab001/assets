    "word": "We feel deeply the need of workers here, and of money to advance the work. The Sabbath-keepers are mostly poor. There are a few who have something of this world's goods, and they have assisted liberally that the cause of God may get a start in this place. We have a printing office here, but no meeting house. We meet in halls that are ill ventilated, and used for all kinds of gatherings. There is no means of warming them in the cold, rainy season, and it is not safe for me to attend meeting at all in unpleasant weather. Last winter they called here unusually unpleasant. I met with the church a few times, but although they wanted me to speak to them, they said they must advise me not to expose myself in my great suffering. If they had had a suitable place to worship, I should have attended, crippled as I was, and spoken to them every Sabbath when it was pleasant. I had to ride five miles to get to the place of meeting, and I was greatly blessed every time I ventured to go out and to speak to them. \n                                                                           1082",
