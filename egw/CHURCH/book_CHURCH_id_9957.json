    "word": "This is an age of almost universal apostasy; and those who claim to hold advanced truth mislead the churches when they do not give evidence that their character and works harmonize with the divine truth. The goodness, the mercy, the compassion, the tenderness, the lovingkindness of God are to be expressed in the words, deportment, and character of all who claim to be children \n\n\n                      - 10 - \n\nof God, especially in those who claim to be messengers sent by the Lord Jesus with the word of life, to save the perishing. They are enjoined by the Bible to put away all that is harsh and coarse and rough in their character, and to be grafted into Christ, the living vine. They should bear the same quality of fruit that the vine bears. Thus only can the branch be a true representation of the preciousness of the vine.",
