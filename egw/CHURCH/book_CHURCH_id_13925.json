    "word": "The twelfth and thirteenth chapters of 1 Corinthians should be \n\n\n           -120- \n\ncommitted to memory, written in the mind and heart. Through His servant Paul, the Lord has placed before us these subjects for our consideration, and those who have the privilege of being brought together in church capacity will be united, understandingly and intelligently. The figure of the members which compose the body represents the church of God and the relation its members should sustain to one another.",
