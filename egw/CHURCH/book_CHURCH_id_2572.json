    "word": "To all who are working for Christ, I would say, Wherever you can get access to the fireside, urge your way there. Take your Bible and open before the people its great truths. Your success will not depend so much upon your knowledge and accomplishments, as upon your ability to find your way to the heart. By being social and coming close to the people, you may turn the current of their thoughts more readily than by the most able discourses. The presentation of Christ, in the family, by the fireside, and in small gatherings in private houses, is often more successful in securing souls to Jesus than are sermons delivered \n341\nin the open air, to the moving throng, or even in halls or churches.",
