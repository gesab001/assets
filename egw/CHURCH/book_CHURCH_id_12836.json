    "word": "Let me tell you, brethren in the church at Lemoore, you need more of Jesus and less of self. Think no evil; talk no evil of anyone; keep your lips as with a bridle. You cannot measure others' experience by your own. It would be a deplorable thing if everyone was of the same mind. If all were just like Brother Buckner in religious experience, there would be a wonderful want of fullness in church labor, in carrying forward the work of God. I do not write this to discourage you, but to help you.",
