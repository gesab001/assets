    "word": "Matters of deep importance were opened before John which were to be given to the world to be read, understood, and appreciated, in the ages to come. Again and again the true witness says, \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\" But it is evident from what is written that some who have ears to hear, will not hear, will not receive the message, and will not become wise in the scriptures. The Lord Jesus, the Alpha and Omega, gave a message to John in regard to the work of the churches; for he understood how great would be the danger of neglecting their God given work, and thus make a failure of diffusing light to others. The invitation \n                                                                           386\nof the gospel was to extend from Christ to the church, and from the church to the world. \"And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say Come. And let him that is a thirst say Come, and whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.\" The work of diffusing the gospel is neglected by those who are specified as hearing. But when the professed people of God hear the message to some purpose, when they take on the burden of the work and say to others, \"Come,\" then they will become laborers together with God.",
