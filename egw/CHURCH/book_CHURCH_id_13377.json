    "word": "Wake up, my brethren, into spiritual life. Daily reveal a determined purpose to be good and to do good. Do not encourage young ministers to preach to the churches. This is not their work. They are to go forth without the camp, taking up the work in places where the truth has not yet been proclaimed. Let them go in the humility and meekness of Christ, gathering strength from the Source of all strength.",
