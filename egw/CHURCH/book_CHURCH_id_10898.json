    "word": "That Saviour has oft visited you in Battle Creek. Just as verily as he walked in the streets of Jerusalem, longing to breathe the breath of spiritual life into the hearts of those discouraged and ready to die, has he come to you. The cities that were so greatly blessed by his presence, his pardon, his gifts of healing, rejected him; and just as great, yea, greater evidence of unrequited love, has been given in Battle Creek. Has Christ not loaded down his church with benefits and blessings? Has he not sent his servants with messages of pardon and righteousness, to be given freely to all who will receive them? \n\n\n                     -28-",
