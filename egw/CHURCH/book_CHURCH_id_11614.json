    "word": "This church cannot present the divine credentials that her doctrines and authority are of God. She does not say \"The . . . works that I do, bear witness of me\" (John 5:36); and \"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not\" (John 10:37). Taking the name of Lutheran, she refers back to Luther, his works, his testimony, and while she has not cherished his spirit as a Reformer she reckons herself as the only lawful inheritor of the blessings God has promised to His church, as did the Jews. But she has turned away from the holy commandment, refused to walk in the brighter path of truth that would have renewed her knowledge and true holiness and given her the victory over the world. She is sitting in darkness and her condemnation is great in proportion as the grace and truth proffered her were abundant and powerful. . . .",
