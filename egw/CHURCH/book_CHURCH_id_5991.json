    "word": "I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE GREAT PROOF OF THE DIVINE HAND IN THE GIFT TO THE REMNANT CHURCH IS IN THE INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE WRITINGS THEMSELVES. NEVERTHELESS, I MUST BELIEVE THAT IN THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS WHICH HAVE ACCOMPANIED THE BESTOWAL OF LIGHT AND REVELATION, THERE IS SOME REAL VALUE; OTHERWISE GOD WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THEM. FURTHERMORE I AM BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH A GREAT MANY PEOPLE, EARNEST, SINCERE, AND PRECIOUS IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD, WHO DO REGARD THESE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS AS A MATTER OF SERIOUS IMPORTANCE, AND THEY TESTIFY THAT THEIR FAITH HAS BEEN GREATLY STRENGTHENED BY A CLEAR KNOWLEDGE OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY OUR HEAVENLY FATHER FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF THE RECEIVERS IN THE LIGHT HE HAS GIVEN THEM.",
