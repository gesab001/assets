    "word": "There is no question but that it is a duty for some to labor among the outcasts, and try to save the souls that are perishing.

He seeks to place them where they will not become strong and have the work of God abiding in them so that they may overcome the wicked one. We must not be ignorant of his devices.--Letter 4, 1899, pp. 7, 28, 30. (To \"Dr. Kellogg and All Who Are Connected With Him in the Sanitarium Board and Councils,\" January 6, 1899.)",
