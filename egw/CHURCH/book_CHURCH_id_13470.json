    "word": "All who honor Christ and adorn the religion of the cross, will be honored by God. But the Lord will not honor you as you now stand. Those who suppose that you are worthy to be honored will give you credit that does not belong to you. You \n\n\n                                     -348- \n\nknow this; I need not tell you. When you accept the obligations laid upon you as one worthy of the position you occupy, you will show an altogether different character. You have a standard to maintain that you have not maintained for years. When you come into harmony with the Lord Jesus Christ, our churches will hear from your lips a testimony of Christian strength, Christian courage, the very root and groundwork of a thoroughly Christian life. You will be steadfast in the faith. You will not see in false science the charms you now see. You will see the danger of your erroneous sentiments becoming woven into the characters of men who do not view things in a correct light.",
