    "word": "As I read the testimonies sent to you at Battle Creek in reference to Bro. Bell, and then compare them with the course which you have steadily pursued, I can but exclaim, How could you do just what the voice of God forbade your doing? The Lord is testing and proving you. He has warned and counseled, admonished and entreated. All these solemn admonitions will either make the church better, or decidedly worse. The oftener the Lord speaks, to correct or counsel, and you disregard his voice, the more disposed will you be to reject it again and again, till God says, \"Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof; I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me; for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord, they would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.\"",
