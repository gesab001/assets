    "word": "I feel deep sorrow of soul that is almost too painful to bear at the state of things that exists in the church at Battle Creek. From the light given me from time to time, altogether too heavy responsibilities are laid upon one man. Whoever is chosen as president, there should be another man \n\n\n                                     -184- \n\nwho should share all the responsibilities, and they should work unitedly. They should be consecrated men, such as there are in all our ranks, men who shall feel the necessity of communing with God and relying upon a \"Thus saith the Lord\" rather than putting their trust in men who are deficient and weak in spirituality, who can talk but who seldom pray. The burning desire to bring in something wonderful of men's devising that will make an appearance has dishonored God and put a complexion upon His work that is a dishonor to God. Oh, that the past record might be blotted out of the books of heaven!",
