    "word": "In the providence of God I was unable to labor as I had hoped, and my mind has been again exercised in reference to the existing state of things. Some things will need to be set in order in the church and in the Echo office. In my great weakness I read to some of those connected with the office, who are bearing responsibilities, the things which the Lord had shown me should control the workers in the office, from the highest to the lowest. I hoped that \n\n\n                                     -285- \n\nthese things would have an influence to make a change for the better. But the burden comes back upon me again, and I will now copy some things that have been shown me of the Lord.",
