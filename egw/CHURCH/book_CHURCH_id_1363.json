    "word": "Economical From Principle \n\n     Those whose hands are open to respond to the calls for means to sustain the cause of God and to relieve the suffering and the needy, are not the ones who are found loose and lax and dilatory in their business management. They are always careful to keep their outgoes within their income. They are economical from principle; they feel it their duty to save, that they may have something to give. --Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 573 (1881). \n\n\n  (304)",
