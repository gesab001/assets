    "word": "Will every member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church now search his own heart, and make earnest, thorough work for repentance? Whenever a man places his own wisdom or wealth or power to control in the place where God should be, he is on the losing side. \"Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord\" [Jeremiah 9:23, 24].",
