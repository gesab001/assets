    "word": "(482) I have been instructed to present these words to our people in Southern Calif. They are needed in every place where a church is established; for a strange experience has been coming into our ranks. It is time now for men to humble their hearts before God, and to learn to work in His ways. Let those who have sought to rule their fellow-workers study to know what manner of spirit they are of. They should seek the Lord by fasting and prayer, and in humility of soul. Christ in His earthly life gave an example that all can safely follow. He appreciates His flock, and He wants no power set over them that will restrict their freedom in His service. He has never placed man as a ruler over His heritage. True Bible religion will lead to self control, not to control of one another. As a people we need a larger measure of the Holy Spirit, that we may bear the solemn message that God has given us without exaltation.",
