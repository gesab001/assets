    "word": "We thank the Lord for the good work being done in behalf of our schools in the publication and sale of the book, Christ's Object Lessons. We rejoice that so large a number of our people have given themselves to the work, and that their efforts are proving so successful. We rejoice that our conference and Tract Society officers have given their influence and energy to this grave enterprise; and that ministers, Bible workers, colporteurs, and church members, old and young, have all engaged so heartily in the special effort to speedily relieve our schools.",
