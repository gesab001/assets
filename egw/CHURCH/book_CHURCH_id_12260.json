    "word": "There should be wise workmen in every church, workmen who seek God, that they may learn the best methods of labor for the tempted and tried and erring, so as not to lose one. It is verily a plan of Satan for our churches to be so inefficient and helpless, depending upon the minister to do the work which they should do, and which they must do, if ever they hear from the lips of Christ the words, \"Well done, thou good and faithful \n\n\n                                 -345- \n\nservant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\" (Matthew 25:21).",
