    "word": "LIKE JACOB, WRESTLE IN PRAYER.\u2014Be in earnest, be sincere. Fervent prayer availeth much. Jacob-like, wrestle in prayer. Agonize. Jesus, in the garden, sweat great drops of blood; you must make an effort. Do not leave your closet until you feel strong in God; then watch, and just as long as you watch and pray you can keep these evil besetments under, and the grace of God can and will appear in you.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, 158.)",
