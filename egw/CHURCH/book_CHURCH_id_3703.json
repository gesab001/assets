    "word": "We have a message of warning to the church. God says to you, \u201cBe zealous and repent.\u201d \u201cI will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\u201d Precious time has been squandered in which you might have won souls to Christ,\u2014souls that through your love of ease are now lost. Every member of the church should awake to duty now. May God help you to take on the burden. Let the church-members pray and fast and believe. Let the hearts of parents be turned to their \n287\nchildren, and the hearts of children to their parents, \u201cLest I come,\u201d saith the Lord, \u201cand smite the earth with a curse.\u201d Your souls are in peril. Shall the Sun of Righteousness set, and leave you enshrouded in the darkness of eternal night?",
