    "word": "There are many who ought to become missionaries, but who never enter the field, because those who are united with them in church capacity or in our colleges do not feel the burden to labor with them, to open before them the claims of God upon all their powers, and do not pray with and for them; the eventful period which decides the course of life passes, their convictions are stifled, other influences and inducements attract them, and temptations to seek positions that will, they think, bring them financial gain, take them into the worldly current. These youth might have been saved to the cause. If our churches do their duty, God will work with their efforts by his Spirit, and will supply faithful laborers for the ministry and the missionary work.",
