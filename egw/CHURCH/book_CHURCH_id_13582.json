Portions of this manuscript appear in the E.G. White Biography, vol. 4.) \n\n\n     I send you, my son, a copy of all that I send to Battle Creek, and I trust you make a right use of this matter. I want that the presidents of conferences shall have the matter I send. You will see that there is need now of the greatest care being exercised. Do not feel anything but sincere pity, and show at this time that you are levelheaded because you move by faith and put your trust in God, and that He is your Helper, your Counsellor.",
