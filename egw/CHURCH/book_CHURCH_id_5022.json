    "word": "WEAKNESS TURNED TO STRENGTH THROUGH PRAYER.\u2014They [many of God\u2019s people] do not see the importance of self-knowledge and self-control. They do not watch and pray, lest they enter into temptation. If they would watch, they would become acquainted with their weak points, where they are most likely to be assailed by temptation. With watchfulness and prayer their weakest points can be so guarded as to become their strongest points, and they can encounter temptation without being overcome. Every follower of Christ should daily examine himself, that he may become perfectly acquainted with his own conduct.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, 511.)",
