    "word": "Not to Judge or Rule--It is dangerous work to invest men with authority to judge and rule their fellow men.  Not to you nor to any other man has been given power to control the actions of God's people, and the effort to do this must be no longer continued . . . . God has been dishonored by the education that has been given to the churches in Southern California in looking to one man as conscience and judgment for them.  God has never authorized any man to exercise a ruling power over his fellow-workers; and those who have allowed a dictatorial spirit to come into their official work need to experience the converting power of God upon their hearts.  They have placed man where God should be.--Letter 290, 1907, pp. 2, 3 (Aug. 29, 1907).",
