    "word": "It may be difficult, sometimes, to hold the principal speakers for some weeks to develop the interest awakened by the meeting; it may be expensive to retain the grounds, and to keep standing a sufficient number of the family tents to maintain the appearance of a camp meeting; it may be at a sacrifice that several families remain camping on the grounds, to assist the ministers and Bible workers in visiting and in holding Bible study with those who come on the grounds, and in visiting the people at their homes, telling them of the blessings received at the meetings, and inviting them to come; but the results will be worthy of the effort. It is by such earnest, energetic efforts as these that some of our camp meetings have been instrumental in raising up strong, working churches; and it is by just such earnest work that the third angel's message must be carried to the people of our cities.-- Review and Herald, April 4, 1899. \n                                                                           83",
