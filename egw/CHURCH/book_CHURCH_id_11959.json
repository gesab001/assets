    "word": "ELDER TAYLOR: WE HAVE TALKED THIS: THAT THE CHURCH SCHOOL WILL NOT BE A BLESSING TO A COMMUNITY, WHEN IT COMES TO TAKE A RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE PARENTS THEMSELVES CAN CARRY. AND WHEN WE GO AHEAD AND PUT OUR MONEY INTO A BUILDING, IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT IS A BUILDING OR A ROOM.

NOW THAT IS ALL I HAVE EVER HEARD WHEN WE HAVE COME TO THE POINT.",
