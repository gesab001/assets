    "word": "THE ACTIVE LABORS OF ELLEN G. HARMON, KNOWN AFTER HER MARRIAGE AS MRS. E. G. WHITE, COVERED A PERIOD OF SEVENTY YEARS, SIXTY YEARS OF WHICH WERE SPENT IN AMERICA, AND TEN YEARS IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALASIA. DURING THIS LONG TIME SHE WAS HONORED WITH MANY\n(244)\n245\nREVELATIONS, WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE HEAVEN-SENT AND WHICH SHE ENDEAVORED FAITHFULLY TO WRITE OUT FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF THE CHURCH. MANY VOLUMES OF HER WRITINGS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED AND HAVE A WORLD-WIDE CIRCULATION. MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, CONVINCED BY THE SCRIPTURES THAT WE ARE LIVING NEAR THE CLOSE OF THIS EARTH'S HISTORY, HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT MRS. WHITE WAS AN AGENT THROUGH WHOM GOD SPOKE BY THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY TO HIS REMNANT CHURCH. SUCH A BELIEF IS SURELY WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION. THE CHARACTER OF HER WORK IS TO BE JUDGED BY HER OWN LIFE, BY HER TEACHINGS, AND BY THE NATURE OF THE REVELATIONS SHE RECEIVED.",
