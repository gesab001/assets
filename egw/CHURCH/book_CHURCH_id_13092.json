    "word": "Let all keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment. Let prayer ascend to God for the Holy Spirit's instruction. Then when it comes, look at yourselves in the great moral looking glass, God's Word, which will always tell you the truth. When God's servants work as laborers together with God out of love for Christ and the souls ready to perish, a very different atmosphere will be brought into our churches. Each man will be found in his place, recognizing the work God has put in his hands to be done for this time.",
