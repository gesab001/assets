    "word": "Giving God's Word a Subordinate Position--We have a deep and earnest desire to see all the members of the churches transformed, physically, mentally and morally. They see men, society, and the world, all in disorder, thinking only of remodeling the fabric. Greater skill, later methods, better facilities, they think will set all things in proper order. Apparently they receive and believe the living Oracles, but they only give the Word of God an inferior position in the great framework of so-called philosophy. It is a secondary consideration with them. That which could stand first is made subordinate to human inventions.--Ms. 58, 1898, p. 9. (\"The Mistake of a Low Fee for Tuition,\" April 17, 1898.)",
