    "word": "The investigation of cases in Battle Creek was very much after the order that a lawyer criticises a witness, and there was a decided absence of the Spirit of God. And there were a few united in this work who were active and zealous. Some were self-righteous and self-sufficient, and their testimonies were relied upon, and their influence swayed the judgment of Brn. Andrews and Waggoner. Sister Hewitt and sister Dodge were not received as members of the church because of some trivial deficiency. These brethren should have had judgment and discrimination to have seen that these objections were not of sufficient weight to keep those sisters out of the church. They both had been long in the faith, and had been true to the observance of the Sabbath for eighteen or twenty years.",
