    "word": "Let us be careful how we pass sentence of condemnation of one for whom we may be cherishing dislike because he does not meet our ideas, for the sentence will reflect upon ourselves, and do far more harm to us than to the one we condemned. Christ would have His church strong in unity. Let us all praise God that we are not to be judged according to finite man's discernment, which is very liable to be perverted.",
