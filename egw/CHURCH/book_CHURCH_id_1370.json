    "word": "We are not to be an obscure church, but we are to let the light shine forth, that the world may receive it. \"I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people,\" God declares through His servant Isaiah. Isaiah 65:19. These words will be proved true when those who are capable of standing in positions of responsibility let the light shine forth. Our leading physicians have a work to do outside the compass of our own people. Their influence is not to be limited. Christ's methods of labor are to become their methods, and they are to learn to practice the teachings of His word. Everyone who stands at the head of an institution is under sacred obligation to God to show forth the light of present truth in increasingly bright rays in every place where opportunity offers.",
