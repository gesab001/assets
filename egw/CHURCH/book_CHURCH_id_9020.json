    "word": "An Exalted Privilege \n\n     God is the Teacher of His people. All who humble their hearts before Him will be taught of God. \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" The Lord wants every church member to pray earnestly for wisdom, that he may know what the Lord would have him do. It is the privilege of every believer to obtain an individual experience, learning to carry his cares and perplexities to God. It is written, \"Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.\"",
