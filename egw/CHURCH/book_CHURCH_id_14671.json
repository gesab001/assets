    "word": "I make a special appeal to the church in Los Angeles. God expects you, as a church to be purified and refined. Put away all accusing and dissension, lay aside all fault-finding and jealousy, and let every one come up to the help of the Lord. You need to arise and trim your lamps, that they may give a clearer light. All should appreciate what is being done to bring the truth before unbelievers.",
