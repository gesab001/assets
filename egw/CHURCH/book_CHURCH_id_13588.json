    "word": "The Lord declares, \"Neither will I be with you any more.\" \"Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also\" [Joshua 7:12, 11].

There must be an awakening to save the situation.",
