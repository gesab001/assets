    "word": "Conference presidents are to arouse their ministers to work as they should.--Can nothing be devised to arouse presidents of Conferences to a sense of their obligations? Would they could see that their position of trust only increases and intensifies their responsibility. If each president would feel the necessity of diligent improvement of his talents in devising ways and means for arousing ministers to work as they should, what a change would take place in every Conference. Do these men realize that the solemn scrutiny of every man's work is soon to begin in heaven? When the Master went away, He gave to every man in every age and in every generation, His work; and He says to us all, \"Occupy till I come.\" Have ministers thought how much is comprehended in these words? Verily there may be but a step between them and death. How stands the record of sacred trusts committed for wise improvement? Misused talents, wasted hours, neglected opportunities, duties left undone, sickly churches, the flock of God not strengthened by having their portion of meat in due season.--Appeal and Suggestions to Conference Officers (Ph 2) 20, 21.",
