    "word": "When a second minister follows the first, and in the fear of God presents the practical duties, the claims of God upon his people, some draw back, saying, \u201cThe minister who brought us the truth did not mention these things. We have been deceived. These things were kept back.\u201d And they become offended because of the word. Some will not accept the tithing system; they turn away, and no longer walk with those who believe and love the truth. When the tract and missionary field is opened before them, inviting them to work in it, they answer, \u201cIt was not so taught us,\u201d and they hesitate to engage in the work. How much better it would be for the cause if the messenger of truth had faithfully and thoroughly educated these converts in regard to all these essential matters, even if there were fewer whom he could number as having been added to the church under his labors.",
