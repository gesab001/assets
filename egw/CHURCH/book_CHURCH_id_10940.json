    "word": "Extravagance in Dress. \n\n     Let those who take such delight in devoting so largely of their means to clothing their bodies, consider that they are using God's money, that might be invested in bearing the truth to those that are perishing in their sins. They need the gospel presented to them; they need to be taught that they must be clothed with the garments of the righteousness of Christ, else they can not have a \n\n\n                         [5] \n\nplace with the saints in light. Those who have had great light, and yet continue to follow the fashions of the world in dress, are using the Lord's money to gratify their pride. They are robbing the cause of God of the means which might far better, for their present and eternal good, be invested in missionary work. When those whose names are on the church books shall be converted, they will no longer delight in their display of dress in the house of God. This is looked upon by the Lord's holy Watcher from heaven, who traces the whole history from cause to effect. He sees what might have been done with the means, had it been used to glorify God, rather than to minister to their pride, and separate their souls from God. The Lord will not serve with the selfish indulgence of these men and women. Had they clothed themselves with modest apparel, as the Holy Spirit has specified they should do, they would have the blessing of God. The atmosphere surrounding their souls would not be as spiritual malaria to others who newly come into the faith. Such examples of show and of the love of dress, of following the fashions of this degenerate age, this leaven of pride and extravagance, is gathering to itself, until the whole lump will be leavened. Let the money expended in bicycles be invested in the cause of God.",
