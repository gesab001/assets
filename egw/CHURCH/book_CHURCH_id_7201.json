    "word": "As we bear testimony against pride and following the fashions of the world, we are met with excuses and self-justification. Some urge the example of others. Such a sister wears hoops; if it is wrong for me to wear them, it is wrong for her. Children urge the example of other children, whose parents are Sabbathkeepers. Brother A is a deacon of the church. His children wear hoops, and why is it any worse for me to wear them than it is for them? Those who by their example furnish unconsecrated professors with arguments against those who would be peculiar, are laying a cause of stumbling in the way of the weak; they must render an account to God for their example. I am often asked: \"What do you think of hoops?\" I reply: I have given you the light which has been given me. I was shown that hoops are a shame, and that we should not give the least countenance to a fashion carried to such ridiculous lengths.",
