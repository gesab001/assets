    "word": "The apostle writes: [Colossians 1:1-11, quoted]. \n     This Scripture speaks of the vital union which should exist between Christ and His disciples. Constantly we are to strive to obtain this union. The religion which consists only of profession is but a pretense. Those whose union with Christ ends with the writing of their names on the church roll are not channels of light.",
