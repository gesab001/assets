    "word": "As Tetzel entered a town, a messenger went before him, announcing, \u201cThe grace of God and of the holy father is at your gates.\u201d And the people welcomed the blasphemous pretender as if he were God himself come down from Heaven to them. The infamous traffic was set up in the church, and Tetzel, ascending the pulpit, extolled indulgences as the most precious gift of God. He declared that by virtue of his certificates of pardon, all the sins which the purchaser should afterward desire to commit would be forgiven him, and that \u201ceven repentance was not indispensable.\u201d More than this, \n128\nhe assured his hearers that the indulgences had power to save not only the living but the dead; that the very moment the money should clink against the bottom of his chest, the soul in whose behalf it had been paid would escape from purgatory and make its way to Heaven.",
