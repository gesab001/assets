    "word": "Christ and the world are not in partnership. The apostle says, \"Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?\" . . . Conformity to the world will never be the means of converting the world to Christ. Christians must be entirely consecrated to God if the church is to be efficient in its influence for good upon unbelievers. The slightest diversion from Christ is so much influence, power, and efficiency given to the enemy.",
