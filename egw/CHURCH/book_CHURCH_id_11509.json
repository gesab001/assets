    "word": "Every man and woman has strong tendencies towards evil, and peculiar traits of character that make him susceptible to temptation. Each one has to battle with his own passions. Each one may see his own perverse habits reproduced in others, and reacting upon his own character. Individually we have a work to do in the strength and grace of Christ. We are to strive most earnestly against our hereditary and cultivated traits of character. If our evil characteristics are not overcome, they will through exercise become stronger and stronger, and pollute mind and character. Unless overcomers, we shall not be fitted for a home with the saints in light. But let no one be discouraged. There is a refuge for every tempted soul. We may avail ourselves of the great privileges and blessings brought to us through the grace of Christ. But there are those whose names are on the church roll who do not know what it is to be resigned to the divine will. They do not realize that they may have perfect trust and repose in God. They have never gone through the struggle of submitting meekly \n\n\n                                     -269- \n\nand humbly to the will of God. It is true that it is hard for self to come to this point, for self ever seeks the supremacy. But the Lord says, \"A new heart also will I give you\" [Ezekiel 36:26]. He has promised to renew the mind and to make us new creatures in Christ Jesus.",
