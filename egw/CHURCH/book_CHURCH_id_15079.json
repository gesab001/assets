    "word": "There are to be schools established in the South for the whites and blacks-separate schools in the South because of the particular prejudice. I will say to every church member, be careful how you keep human minds in a species of slavery because they have a black skin. Will any of you despise the workmanship of God, and depress and trample down those you should try to help up and prepare them through education to have clean, pure souls? We are to call upon all who love God and keep His commandments to unite in Christian Endeavor Societies (even a few in different localities) to see what may be accomplished for the blacks, as a special work God requires to be done.",
