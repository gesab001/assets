    "word": "After man has cost such an infinite price as the Son of God, that He might make him a being of His throne, how tenderly should man deal with his fellow men. How fearful should brethren and sisters in the church feel lest they shall hurt the oil and the wine, and push and destroy one of God's little ones. How patiently, kindly, and affectionately should they deal with the purchase of the blood of Christ. How faithfully should they labor, and how earnestly, to lift up the desponding, the discouraged, and those whose surroundings may not be as favorable as their own. How tenderly should they treat those who, while seeking to obey the truth, have no encouragement at home, but have constantly to breathe the atmosphere of unbelief.",
