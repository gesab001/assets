    "word": "Those who constitute the active element in the church at Ligonier are the ones who should see their wrongs and be willing to confess them, or they should be disconnected from the church. Their spirits are strong and uncontrollable; if checked lightly today, they will rise in triumph tomorrow if they have a chance. They will gather about them those who cannot see and understand their spirit and who will oppose any influence that would check their movements.",
