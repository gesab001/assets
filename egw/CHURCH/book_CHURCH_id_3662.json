    "word": "\u201cLouder songs re-echoed day by day round the walls of Malmo, as the number of worshipers increased.

The churches were opened to the preachers; the praises uttered outside the walls were now heard within the city. It seemed as if Malmo rejoiced because salvation was come to it. Mass was abolished, and in 1529 the Protestant religion was almost universally professed by the inhabitants.\u201d A theological college was established here, from which many able teachers went out to spread the doctrines of the Reformation.",
