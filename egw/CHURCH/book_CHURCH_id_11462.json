    "word": "The Bishop of the state church was present. There were a number of the clergy present. The higher class of society were my hearers. After I had ceased speaking and stepped from the desk, Dr. Nysson took the stand and endorsed every word that had been spoken and that Brother Oyen had interpreted for me. He was very liberal in his thanks to the speaker for giving them the discourse. He then introduced me to some of their leading temperance men and women. Not a few came to greet me by shaking hands and saying, \"I am so thankful to have heard you tonight. I never listened to a temperance discourse like this before.\" Indeed, when I was speaking the congregation looked as solemn as if attending a funeral. No smiles were seen and no stamping of feet was heard, for it was too solemn a subject to excite laughter or merriment. Dr. Nysson expressed the ardent desire that I should address them again, but I feel that our people here need my help and I must do all for them that is in my power.--Ms 27, 1885, pp. 1-6.
