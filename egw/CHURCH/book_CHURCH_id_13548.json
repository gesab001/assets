    "word": "This morning I am weak, because of an attack of influenza that came upon me during our visit to southern California. While at the Paradise Valley Sanitarium I drove to San Diego to speak in the church there; and then, after taking a cold bath, I drove back to the sanitarium, nearly seven miles. This did not seem to weary me; but afterward I was traveling from place to place, and bearing heavy burdens, and in some way I contracted a cold that it has been difficult for me to throw off.",
