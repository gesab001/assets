    "word": "Christiania, Norway, Nov. 1, 1885. Sabbath was a pleasant day. I spoke to the people in the hall where the church met to worship, from 1 Peter 1:13-17. I had freedom in presenting to the people the importance of practical godliness. All listened with great attention. The hall was full. In the afternoon the ordinances were administered, and the washing of feet. In the evening a discourse was given by Elder Matteson.",
