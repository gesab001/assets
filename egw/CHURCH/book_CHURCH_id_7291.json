    "word": "Chap. 108 - Be Not Deceived\n\n     It is the work of Satan to deceive God's people and lead them from the right course. He will leave no means untried; he will come upon them where they are least guarded; hence the importance of fortifying every point. The Battle Creek church did not mean to turn against us, they are as good a church as lives; but there is much at stake at Battle Creek, and Satan will bring all his artillery against them if by so doing he can hinder the work. We deeply sympathize with this church in their present humbled condition and would say: Let not a spirit of triumph arise in any heart. God will heal all the wrongs of this dear people and yet make them a mighty defense of His truth if they walk humbly and watch and guard every point against the attacks of Satan. This people are kept continually under the fire of the enemy. No other church would probably stand it as well, therefore look with a pitying \n                                                                           629\neye toward your brethren at Battle Creek and pray God to help them in keeping the fort.",
