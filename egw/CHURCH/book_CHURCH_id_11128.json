    "word": "The brothers B. make a mistake in remaining at Bordoville. They should change their location, and not see Bordoville oftener than a few times in the year. They would have greater freedom in bearing their testimony. These brethren have not felt freedom to speak out truth and facts as they existed. If they had lived elsewhere, they would have been more free from burdens, and their testimony would have had tenfold more weight when they should visit the church at Bordoville. While brother A. C. B. has been weighed down with petty church trials, and kept at Bordoville, he should have been laboring abroad. He has served tables until his mind has become clouded, and he has not comprehended the force and power of the truth. He has not been awake to the real wants of the cause of God. He has been losing spirituality and courage. The work of keeping up Systematic Benevolence has been neglected.

Brother B. has been favored with superior privileges, and if these are not improved, condemnation and darkness will follow equal to the light he has had, for the non-improvement of the talents lent of God for him to improve.",
