    "word": "The Public School or Church School?--Many years ago, in Oakland, my husband and I conversed with a public school teacher in regard to the public schools in the city. He said to us: \"If parents knew of the iniquity that is to our certain knowledge practiced in these schools, there would be a furor raised in regard to these schools such as neither you nor I can imagine. The young people are rotten; and what kind of homes they have is more than our teachers can tell.\" This statement was made over twenty years ago.
