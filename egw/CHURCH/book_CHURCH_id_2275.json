    "word": "We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty, within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the claims of God, we must obey God rather than men. God's Word must be recognized as above all human legislation. A \"Thus saith the Lord\" is not to be set aside for a \"Thus saith the church\" or a \"Thus saith the state.\" The crown of Christ is to be lifted above the diadems of earthly potentates.",
