Awake! Awake!\n\n                       Sanitarium, Cal., Jan. 24, 1907. \n\n     I have a message from the Lord to all our churches. Divine truth is to be received and communicated; its saving principles are to enlighten the world. Those who are truly converted must become more and more intelligent in their understanding of the Scriptures, that they may be able to speak words of light and salvation to those who are in darkness, and perishing in their sins.",
