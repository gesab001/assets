    "word": "Last Sunday afternoon quite a number of our brethren from neighboring churches met on the lawn under the trees just back of the main building, and Brother Burden says they had an excellent meeting. One man said he had gone to the camp meeting in Los Angeles as an unbeliever, but had been convicted of the Sabbath truth. He seemed very happy, and made a donation of one hundred dollars to Loma Linda. We shall now endeavor to secure the necessary means, so that we shall not have to carry a heavy burden of interest on borrowed money.",
