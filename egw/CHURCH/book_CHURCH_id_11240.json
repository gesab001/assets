    "word": "There is today in our world an unceasing unrest among the nations. Yet the nations are as if held back from action by unseen forces. In their moral disorder, the powers are in terrible confusion. This will be seen in every church, in every institution that claims to believe the truth for this time. These are the objects of Satan's special work. He strives to unsettle the workers, to make them discontented. If there are among them unconsecrated ministers or teachers, who \n\n\n                        -7- \n\nhave attributes of character that Satan delights to handle, he will use them to plant the seed that yields thorns.",
