    "word": "I spoke in the missionary meeting in regard to the importance of the canvassing work. I also spoke at length in the afternoon, at half-past two o'clock. I was pleased to see Charlie Morrison, his wife Emma, and his son, as attentive hearers of the Word. I spoke from the words found in John 3:1-4. The Seventh-day Adventist church was full. Many from other denominations and from the First-day Adventists were present, and all listened with deepest interest. The Lord gave me the Word and fervor and power to address the audience.--Ms. 51, 1890, p. 15 (Diary 16, p. 396).",
