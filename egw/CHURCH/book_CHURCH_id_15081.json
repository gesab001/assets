    "word": "The assistance of white medical missionaries will be needed in many cases, but the Lord God of Israel will be exalted. White teachers in schools are often essential, and why? Because many of the colored have been accustomed to see the cruelty practiced upon the colored. They have it printed in their own minds [that] they must act as they have seen white masters act, with greatest severity. Can you be surprised at this showing? Does it seem that with all the training they have had in brute force exercised upon them that the class of education of brute force will be entirely eradicated? They will manifest something of the same in church membership. The whole mind will have to be changed by the working, molding influence of the Holy Spirit. And the human mind of a colored person is not particularly different from a white person, and according to their advantages the enemy will work upon human minds to carry out his work of confusion in the minds of the ones who have the best opportunities and do not improve them to the glory of God.",
