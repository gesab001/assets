    "word": "The Lord has had a church from that day, through all the changing scenes of time to the present period. . . . The Bible sets before us a model church.

When believers are united in Christ the living vine, the result is that they are one with Christ, full of sympathy and tenderness and love.--Manuscript 21, 1893.",
