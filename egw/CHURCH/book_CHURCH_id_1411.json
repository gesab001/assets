There are some who think that the question of diet is not of sufficient importance to be included in their evangelistic work. But such make a great mistake. God's word declares, \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\" 1 Corinthians 10:31. The subject of temperance, in all its bearings, has an important place in the work of salvation.",
