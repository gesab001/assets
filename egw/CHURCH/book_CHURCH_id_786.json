    "word": "Chap. 5 - The Church a Training Center\n\n              The Need of the Hour \n\n     That which is needed now for the upbuilding of our churches is the nice work of wise laborers to discern and develop talent in the church,--talent that can be educated for the Master's use. There should be a well organized plan for the employment of workers to go into all our churches, large and small, to instruct the members how to labor for the upbuilding of the church, and also for unbelievers. It is training, education, that is needed. Those who labor in visiting the churches should give the brethren and sisters instruction in practical methods of doing missionary work.--Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 117.",
