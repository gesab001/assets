    "word": "But, oh, sad picture! Those who do not submit to the influence of the Holy Spirit soon lose the blessings received when they acknowledged the truth as from heaven. They fall into a cold, spiritless formality; they lose their interest in perishing souls: they have \"left their first love.\" And Christ says unto them, \"Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent\" (Revelation 2:5). He will take His Holy Spirit from the church, and give [the Spirit] to others who will appreciate Him.",
