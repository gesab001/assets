    "word": "To be a Christian means a great deal more than is supposed. A Christian is Christlike. Membership in the church does not make us Christians. Has the light from Christ penetrated the heart? Are justice and purity and truth abiding in the soul temple? We may know; for the fruits will appear. [Galatians 5:22-26;  6:1-3, quoted.] This is not a time for brother to cherish prejudice against brother. Put not into our enemies' hands anything that bears the least suggestion of differences among us, even in opinion.",
