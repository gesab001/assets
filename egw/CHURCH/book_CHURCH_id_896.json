    "word": "Elder Olsen told us also of the encouraging beginnings among the Italians, Serbians, Rumanians, Russians, and several other nationalities. We rejoice with him in all that has been done, and yet our hearts were made sad by the knowledge that much that might have been done has been left undone because of lack of means. We hope that the special collection . . . taken in all our churches in America, will enable our brethren having this department in charge to do more aggressive work in the great cities of the land. Thus many may be won to our ranks, and from among these may be developed laborers who can proclaim the message to those of their own nationality in our own land and in the other nations of earth.--Review and Herald, October 29, 1914.",
