    "word": "The great missionary spirit of the church is to be aroused. But the Lord Jesus comes forth yet once again to speak to John, and present the missionary work to be done in our world. He sees that the message, the last message of warning, is not thoroughly understood. The angel with the everlasting gospel did not awaken the people to move them to action. He came personally to John and announced to him the missionary work to be done. [Revelation 22:10-17, quoted.]--Ms 130, 1901. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 7, 1986.
