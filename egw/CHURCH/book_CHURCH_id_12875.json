    "word": "Jesus adds to the lesson these words: \"Verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" This assurance that after the rules of Christ have been followed to the letter the decisions of the church will be ratified in heaven, gives a solemn significance to the action of the church. No hasty steps should be taken to cut off names from the church books or to place a member under censure until the case has been investigated and the Bible rule fully obeyed.",
