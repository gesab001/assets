    "word": "Church members should become active, zealous workers, seeking to benefit the souls who are exposed to temptation, and who are being drawn away into perilous paths of disobedience to the commandments of God. Everyone who engages in this work in the love of Christ is cooperating with heavenly intelligences, who have long been waiting to aid them in the very class of missionary work that has been so long neglected. Those who engage in this class of work will have more than finite energy to work with them and through them. Let every Christian in the church seek to devise plans to interest and instruct the children, and be determined that he will not fail nor be discouraged in the work. If they work as they should, they will feel the need of divine guidance, for it is not possible to be successful in this matter without the help of God. Children are the property of God, the younger members of the Lord's family, and interest expressed for these children and for the mothers of these children is in perfect harmony with the laws of God's government.",
