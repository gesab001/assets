    "word": "Revival Meetings at Greenville \n\n     About this time we commenced labor for our brethren and friends near Greenville. As is the case in many places, our brethren needed help. There were some who kept the Sabbath, yet did not belong to the church, and also some who had given up the Sabbath. We felt disposed to help these poor souls, but the past course and present position of leading members of the church in relation to these persons, made it almost impossible for us to approach them.",
