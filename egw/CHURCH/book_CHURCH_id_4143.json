    "word": "Jesus would impress upon the hearts and minds of His disciples the value of the human soul. He demands cooperation on the part of His followers in rescuing lost sinners. There is one lost sheep, the very least that could be numbered; and yet He represents the shepherd as leaving the ninety and nine, and going into the mountains to seek that one lost wanderer. Then why is it that the sons and daughters of God are so cold of heart, so indifferent to the souls that are perishing around them? Why is it that the members of the church are so willing to let the whole burden rest upon the shoulders of the minister? How great a mistake is this, since every subject of grace is to have a part to act in saving those that are lost.",
