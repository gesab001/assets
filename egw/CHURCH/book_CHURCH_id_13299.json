    "word": "The lost sheep of God's fold are scattered in every place, and the work that should be done to save them is not being done. In the fourteenth chapter of John a true test is presented to every man. Here we are told of our obligation to obey the commandments of God. Christ says, \"If ye love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. . . . He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me, and he that loveth Me \n\n\n                                     -153- \n\nshall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him. . . . If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him\" [verses 15-17, 21, 23]. These words are not to be trifled with, for they bear witness to our obligation to obey all the commandments. This is where the churches are lacking. They do not keep the commandments of God, but are transgressors of the law. Those who have a genuine love for Christ will reveal this love by their obedience.",
