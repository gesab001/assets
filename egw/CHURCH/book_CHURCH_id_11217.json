    "word": "\"Unless more is done than has been done for the cities of America, ministers and people will have a heavy account to settle with the One who has appointed to every man his work. . . . May God forgive our terrible neglect in not doing the work that as yet we have scarcely touched with the tips of our fingers. . . . After you have given something for foreign fields, do not think your duty done. . . . In the cities of America there are people of almost every language. These need the light that God has given to His church.\"--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. VIII, pp. 35-37.",
