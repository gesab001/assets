    "word": "What the church in Battle Creek needs is to be doers of the word. This will lead a large number out of Battle Creek into other places, towns, and cities, where people have not had the light and opportunities that you have had. Many souls are now hanging in the balance. They are not with Christ. They are not gathering with Christ. Their influence is divided. They scatter abroad.",
