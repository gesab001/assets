    "word": "If Bro. Andrews had for a time located at Adams' Center, he could have exerted an influence for good over that church. But Bro. Andrews was not pleased with the prospect of making his home at Adams' Center. His inclination was to listen to the persuasion of his friends with whom he was well acquainted, and settle in Rochester. While he was hesitating, Bro. Taylor moved to Adams' Center, and Bro. Andrews felt that his way was hedged up. Bro. Taylor has not been a blessing to the church at Adams' Center, but a burden. He was not qualified to give that large church the very help they really needed, and must have, in order to prosper and increase in grace and in the knowledge of the truth. The church has been growing weaker under Bro. Taylor's labors, instead of stronger. Bro. Andrews reasoned that the Lord had closed up his way in going to Adams' Center. But he was too slow. He did not move quick enough.",
