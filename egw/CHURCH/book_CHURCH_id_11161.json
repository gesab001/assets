    "word": "The matter that was brought out in public in regard to the letter written by sister Smith was not as it should have been. Brn. \n                                                                           39\nAndrews and Waggoner did not act the part upon this occasion they would have wished acted toward them. Sister Smith was placed in the worst light it was possible for her to be before the large company present. The writing of the letter was not right. It savored of the same spirit which prevailed at Battle Creek at the time it was written. But the motives of sister Smith in writing the letter were not what my husband, myself, and many others, supposed they must have been. Our feelings from that time were that sister Smith had gone too far for repentance. It was a cruel act mentioning the letter in the place and time it was mentioned. If these brethren had presented the facts before Bro. and sister Smith alone first, and if they could get no satisfaction, if the case was positively necessary, they could then have brought it before the church in a more public manner.",
