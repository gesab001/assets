    "word": "After the season of prayer, we asked those who were conscious of the blessing of the Lord to testify. Although many of them had been in the church from nine o'clock in the morning, and had had nothing to eat in that time, they were in no hurry to have the meeting closed. Many testimonies were borne, and again supplications were made to God for ministers and people. The presence of the Lord was in the meeting. I felt the power of the Lord upon me. Elder Fifield was greatly blessed. After the season of prayer he grasped my hand and thanked the Lord for His goodness and rich blessing. It was the universal testimony from the Lord that the people at Danvers had never before experienced [so great a blessing].",
