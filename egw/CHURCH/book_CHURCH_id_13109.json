    "word": "MR No. 1258 - The Need for Church and Sanitarium Buildings\n\n     (Written May 1, 1899, from Summer Hill, New South Wales, to \"Dear Brother Haynes.\") \n\n\n     We received your donation of two pounds. We thank you for it, for we stand very much in need of means. The Captain Norman who it was stated in our papers donated such large sums, has proved a fraud. Not one dollar has been realized. He has disappeared, no one can tell where. It is a strange affair and a great disappointment to us. We did hope for the financial help we so much needed, but this is one thing among the \"all things\" that work together for good to those that love God.",
