    "word": "It has ever been against my principle to enter into controversy with any one, or to spend my time in vindicating myself against the attacks of those who do not hesitate to adopt any means to pervert the truth, or to cast stigma upon those who stand in defense of the law of God. Nothing would please Satan and his followers better than to have me engage in this work; for then they would give me enough to keep me busy all the time, and thus my real work would be left undone. But this is not the work that God has given me. Years ago I determined to let nothing draw me from the work of speaking and writing plain Bible truth. Unmoved alike by condemnation or approval, censure or applause, falsehood or flattery, I have not shunned to declare, without partiality and without hypocrisy, the message that God has given me. I have always borne, and trust that I shall ever continue to bear, a plain, decided testimony against sin in the church and out.",
