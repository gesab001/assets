    "word": "Battle Creek, January 20, 1891 \n\n     We learn that the good work has been going on in the church. The last Sabbath, in the afternoon, Elder Smith attended the Ministerial Institute meeting, in the chapel connected with the office. He spoke again of his mistakes, and went back to Minneapolis and confessed his wrong there and since that time. There was a good spirit in the meeting and advance was made. I felt grateful to God for these tokens of the working of the Spirit of God.",
