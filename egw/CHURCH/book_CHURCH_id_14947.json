    "word": "A great work is before us. There are a few who carry the heavy burden of responsibility. They feel that God has committed to our American churches a solemn trust in the messages of truth to be given to the world. From all nations the Macedonian cry is heard, \"Come over and help us.\" God in His providence has opened fields before us, and if the human agents co-operate with the divine agencies, many souls may be made partakers of a pure and saving faith. For years the appeal has been made, but the Lord's professed people have been sleeping over their allotted work, and it remains almost untouched. God has sent message after message to arouse our churches to do something, and to do it now. But to the call of God, \"Whom shall I send?\" There has been few voices to respond, \"Here am I, send me.\" Through this neglect, many souls will lose the opportunity the Lord desires to give them.",
