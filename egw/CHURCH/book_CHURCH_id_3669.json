    "word": "A Lutheran Church\n     We visited a Lutheran church, an old building which has, apparently, stood unchanged for hundreds of years. It is built of logs, the walls as well as the roof covered with clumsy split shingles, and painted a muddy red. The doors are low. On the inside, the building is arched and ceiled. It seemed like a prison; the air struck us with a peculiar, dungeon-like chill, and the close box pews, with their narrow seats and high, straight backs, suggested torture. In the place where the pulpit stands in our churches, was the altar, but not elevated above the floor. It was surrounded at a little distance by a circular railing, outside of which was a low seat for the communicants to kneel upon while taking the holy wafer. To the right of the altar, attached to a projecting pillar, was a little box-like pulpit approached by a flight of steps. An hour-glass added still further to the antiquated appearance of the place. The priest's study in the rear was lighted by small grated windows. It contained a table and chair, and two small cases of books, and was in keeping with the rest of the building. A more dismal place I do not wish to see. This old building seemed like a relic of the Dark Ages, as if priest and people had been asleep for hundreds of years. I could not but think that it fitly represented the condition of the church.",
