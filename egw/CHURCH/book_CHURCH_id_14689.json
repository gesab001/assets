    "word": "We hear that something is now being done in Boston. We are rejoiced to learn, through a report in a recent \"Review\" of Elder L. S. Wheeler's work as pastor of the Boston church, and of the work of his faithful co-laborers. We are also pleased to learn that Elder F. C. Gilbert has been laboring in Everett, (299) a suburb. We hope that those in charge of the work in New England will cooperate with the Melrose Sanitarium managers in taking aggressive steps to do the work that should be done in Boston. A hundred workers could be laboring to advantage in different portions of the city, in varied lines of service.",
