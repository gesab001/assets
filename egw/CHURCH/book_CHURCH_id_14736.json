    "word": "The Saviour bids us pray, \"Lead us not into temptation.\" Our heavenly Father will lead us not into temptation. Our heavenly Father will lead His people in the paths of righteousness. The word of the Lord to the churches in this conference is: \"Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. Be on your guard against the efforts of the powers of darkness to resist the testimonies of God's Spirit, that are to be understood.\" Actions spring from (551) desires and purposes. God alone can discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. He weighs with unerring accuracy the very motives of the mind.",
