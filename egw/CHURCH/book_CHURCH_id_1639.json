    "word": "Those who plead for low tuition should carefully weigh matters on all sides. If students cannot of themselves command sufficient means to pay the actual expense of good and faithful work in their education, is it not better that their parents, their friends, or the churches to which they belong, or largehearted, benevolent brethren in their conference, should assist them, than that a burden of debt should be brought upon the school? It would be far better to let the many patrons of the institution share the expense, than for the school to run in debt.",
