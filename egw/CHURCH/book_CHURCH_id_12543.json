    "word": "Medical Missionary Work Is the Right Hand of the Gospel--I have a message for our people in Indiana, and trust that it will be read to our brethren and sisters in every church in the conference. My heart is made glad as I hear of the efforts being made by our people in Indiana to establish a sanitarium at LaFayette. The circumstances connected with the beginning of this work at LaFayette are certainly very encouraging. If the churches in Indiana will unite heartily to carry to completion this good work that has been begun, very many will be benefited thereby.",
