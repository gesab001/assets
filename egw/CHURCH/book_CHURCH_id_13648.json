    "word": "MR No. 1566 - The Ings Invited to Join the Work in England\n\n     (Written May 26, 1886, from Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, to Brother and Sister Ings.) \n\n\n     We have been traveling among the churches with my own team. Left Basel May 20 and journeyed two days to Tramelan. Oh, what scenery! No one can tell what Switzerland is unless they have traveled over the road by horse and carriage. I spoke three times in Tramelan. There is a goodly number there. Eleven came from this place and we had a good meeting. Brother John Vuilleumier was my interpreter.",
