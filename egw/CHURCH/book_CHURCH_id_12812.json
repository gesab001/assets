    "word": "Jesus was the sinner's friend; His heart was ever open, ever touched with human woe. He has all power both in heaven and upon earth, but He respects the means He has ordained for the enlightenment and salvation of men. He directs Saul to the church, thus acknowledging the power He has placed upon the church as a channel of light to the world. It is Christ's organized body upon the earth, and respect was required to be paid to His ordinances. Ananias represents Christ in the case of Saul. He also represents Christ's ministers upon the earth who are appointed to act in Christ's stead.",
