    "word": "This principle we in our day are firmly to maintain. The banner of truth and religious liberty held aloft by the founders of the gospel church and by God\u2019s witnesses during the centuries that have passed since then, has, in this last conflict, been committed to our hands. The responsibility for this great gift rests with those whom God has blessed with a knowledge of His Word. We are to receive this Word as supreme authority. We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty, within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the claims of God, we must obey God rather than human beings. God\u2019s Word must be recognized as above all human legislation. A \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d is not to be set aside for a \u201cThus saith the church\u201d or a \u201cThus saith the state.\u201d The crown of Christ is to be lifted above the diadems of earthly potentates. . . .",
