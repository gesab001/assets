    "word": "The very fact of having a church in connection with the Sanitarium will give character to our work. It will be a testimony that we are seeking the eternal good of all who are brought within the sphere of our influence. The Sanitarium presents a vineyard to be worked; it \n\n\n                          - 11 - \n\nis God's vineyard, and it needs consecrated ability. Let not pharisaism prevail. There are plenty of subjects to dwell upon to win hearts, and wisdom should be exercised by every teacher. All should remember that they are addressing people who have no knowledge of the third angel's message. It is Greek to them. Let those who have any part in connection with the Sanitarium speak and act circumspectly.",
