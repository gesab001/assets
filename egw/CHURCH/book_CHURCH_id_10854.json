    "word": "Now I plead with every soul to look not too strongly and confidently to human counselors, but look most earnestly to God, the One wise in counsel. Submit all your ways and your will to God's ways and to God's will. If you did not sufficiently consider the glory of God, the good of your own spiritual interest, and the work you might do for the saving of the souls of the neighbors and those with whom you were associated, when you left to make your home in the large church in Battle Creek, duly consider before making another move whether that is sensible and sound, in the right time and order, and under the supervision and direction \n\n\n                         -19- \n\nnot of man, but God, who never commits an error. Should some move hastily, and fly out of Battle Creek, and be brought into discouragement, they will not reflect upon themselves for moving unadvisedly, but upon others, who, they will say brought a pressure to bear upon them, all their discomfiture and defeat are charged back upon those who should not be reflected upon; for the Lord has given to them reason; he has given his holy word, full of counsel and cautions, and warnings and entreaties, and more, he has invited them, \"Come unto me all ye that labor and are heaven laden, and I will give you rest.\"",
