    "word": "MR No. 182 - Material Requested by the Battle Creek Church for Promotion\n\n     The brethren think we ought to have a little house put up. We pay now $1.50 per week for rent, and have scarcely any conveniences at that. Have to go a great distance for water; have no good shed for our wood. We put a few boards up at our own expense just to cover our wood. We shall make a beginning; cannot tell how we shall succeed. May the Lord guide us in all our undertakings is my prayer.--Letter 9, 1856, p. 3. (To Sister E. P. Below, Jan. 1, 1856.) \n\nReleased December 1965.",
