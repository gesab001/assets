    "word": "If one member of Christ's household falls into temptation, the other members are to look after him with kindly interest, seeking to arrest the feet that are straying into false paths, and win him to a pure, holy life. This service God requires from every member of His church. . . . The members of the Lord's family are to be wise and watchful, doing all in their power to save their weaker brethren from Satan's concealed nets.",
