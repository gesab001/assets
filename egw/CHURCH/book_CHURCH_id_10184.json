    "word": "In all the Lord's arrangements, there is nothing more beautiful than His plan of giving to men and women a diversity of gifts. The church of God is made up of many vessels, both large and small. The Lord works through those who are willing to be used. He will bless them in doing the work that has brought blessing to many in the past,--the work of seeking to save souls ready to perish. There are many who have received but a limited religious and intellectual training, but God has a work for this class to do, if they will labor in humility, trusting in Him.",
