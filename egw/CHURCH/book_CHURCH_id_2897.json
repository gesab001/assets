    "word": "With such weapons the advocates of truth in every age have been attacked. The same arguments are still urged against all who dare to present, in opposition to established errors, the plain and direct teachings of God's Word. \u201cWho are these preachers of new doctrines?\u201d exclaim those who desire a popular religion. \u201cThey are unlearned, few in numbers, and of the poorer class. Yet they claim to have the truth, and to be the chosen people of God. They are ignorant and deceived. How greatly superior in numbers and influence is our church! How many great and learned men are among us! How much more power is on our side!\u201d These are the arguments that have a telling influence upon the world, but they are no more conclusive now than in the days of the reformer.",
