    "word": "In every place where churches are raised up, just such a work must be done. If there are twelve believers, there must \n\n136. \n\nbe a house of worship where they can assemble for the service of God. This part of the work is a positive necessity. During my illness two years ago I received from my brethren in California donations amounting to nearly forty dollars for my own personal benefit. I have added to it enough to swell it to fifty, and have given it toward lifting the debt from the church in Parramatta. These three little meeting houses in New South Wales are the only ones we own in all Australia, one at Kellyville, eleven miles from Granville, one in Parramatta under a heavy debt, and one in process of building at Seven Hills, in a farming district. This church we will not dedicate until the last dollar is paid, not if I have to increase my donation.",
