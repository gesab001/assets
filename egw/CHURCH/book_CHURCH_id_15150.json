    "word": "If we are in fellowship with Christ, we shall be in fellowship with our brethren, and shall learn to keep that harmony that should ever exist between the believers. Love must be cherished for one another, for the strengthening of the church, and that we may give to the world the very best impressions of our faith: \"A new commandment I give unto you,\" said Christ, \"that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.\" \n                                     (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
