    "word": "Elder Daniels has knowledge enough; it is heart work that he lacks. You in Fresno have acted a part that God cannot approve. You have encouraged, praised, and \n\n\n                          [21] \n\nexalted the man, when, to your certain knowledge, his course was unlike that which a minister of the gospel should pursue. I cannot allow you and the churches to cloak over a man's wrong course and set him in the pulpit to preach the word of God to the church, without remonstrating. He can move the feelings but so can men who have not a particle of the Spirit of God. They can make the people laugh or cry at will. Some will be pleased with the smartness of E. P. Daniels, because they have not had their own eyes anointed with the eye-salve of true spiritual discernment. Sin is interpreted to be righteousness; black is made to appear white.",
