    "word": "\u201cThe design of the message to the Laodiceans was to rid the church of just such fanatical influences; but the effort of Satan has been to corrupt the message and to prevent its proper effect. He would be better pleased to have fanatical persons embrace the testimony and use it in his cause, than to have them remain in a lukewarm state. I have seen that it was not the design of the message to lead any one to sit in judgment upon his brother, to tell him what to do and just how far to go; but for each individual to search his own heart, and \n334\nattend to his own individual work. It is the work of the angels to watch the development of character, and weigh moral worth.\u201d [The testimony to the Laodiceans here referred to may be found in \u201cTestimony for the Church\u201d No. 5, to which the reader's attention is specially called.]",
