    "word": "OUR LIVES ARE TO BE IN HARMONY WITH OUR PETITIONS.\u2014Pray in faith. And be sure to bring your lives into harmony with your petitions, that you may receive the blessings for which you pray. Let not your faith weaken, for the blessings received are proportionate to the faith exercised. \u201cAccording to your faith be it unto you.\u201d\u201cAll things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.\u201d Matthew 9:29; 21:22. Pray, believe, rejoice. Sing praises to God because He has answered your prayers. Take Him at His word. \u201cHe is faithful that promised.\u201d Hebrews 10:23. Not one sincere supplication is lost. The channel is open; the stream is flowing. It carries with it healing properties, pouring forth a restoring current of life and health and salvation.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, 274.)",
