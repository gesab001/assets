    "word": "I hear everywhere I go objections to the testimonies, quoting Elders Smith and Butler. They do not believe the testimonies; they do not accept that which Sister White has had in reproof of their course. Are not these good men? Have they not stood high in the work and cause of God? Then the seed of doubt and unbelief is sown in minds by those who have been themselves reproved. These men are and have been for years counteracting the work the Lord would have done to keep clear eyesight in the church and purge them from wrongs.",
