    "word": "Use of the Tithe. \n\n     God's ministers are his shepherds, appointed by him to feed his flock. The tithe is his provision for their maintenance, and he designs that it shall be held sacred for this purpose. The Lord desires that his servants shall be sustained in a proper manner, not in so niggardly a way that they are constantly embarrassed for want of funds. I have been shown cases in which those working in the ministry,--men who were just as deserving as are those employed in the publishing houses,--have been left without sufficient means to support their families. The censure of God is upon the churches that will permit this. Our ministers should be dealt with in a fair, liberal, Christian manner, yet there should be no extravagance; economy must be practiced; for the wants of the cause of God are many, and it must advance.",
