    "word": "Matters connected with the church are to be kept within its own borders. If a Christian is abused, he is to take it patiently; if defrauded, he is not to appeal to courts of justice. Rather let him suffer loss and wrong. God will deal with the unworthy church member who defrauds his brother or the cause of God; the Christian need not contend for his rights. God will deal with the one who violates these rights. \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\" [Romans 12:19.] An account is kept of all these matters, and \n\n\n                                     -411- \n\nfor all the Lord declares that He will avenge. He will bring every work into judgment.",
