    "word": "As regard the debt on the Battle Creek College, I think that W.C. White has written wisely. It is your privilege to present the case to the churches, and ask them to help to lessen this debt. Then devise methods by which the school may be made self-supporting. This could have been accomplished in past years by increasing the rates of tuition. Here at Avondale the tuitions at first were too low. Embarrassment was brought upon the school.",
