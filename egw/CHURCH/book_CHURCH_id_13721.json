    "word": "There is a wisdom that is not from above, an unsanctified wisdom which has been in our world since the fall. I have been shown that there is danger in the office of publication in Battle Creek. It is losing its peculiar character. The Lord directed in the establishment of this institution, and it should never, never take a worldly mold. The men who have banded together to carry certain matters without the voice of the church or the people will not stand, for God will not permit it. There is a lifting up of self. Too much confidence is shown in what man can do, and too little in what God can do, and therefore man's wisdom has become foolishness.",
