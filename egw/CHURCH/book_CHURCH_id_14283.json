    "word": "There is need of spiritual guides whose words will be a tonic to the church, who are acquainted with the science of healing the broken heart, of being a physician to the sick sheep and lambs, sermonizing a great deal less and binding up the wounds of the sheep and of the lambs. The sanctification of the soul is the only true elevation of man. While the true shepherd of the sheep will humble his heart before God with the burden of the great responsibility in his position of trust, and with a sense of his weakness, his deficiencies, and with the fear of God before him, he will cry unto God with all his soul for divine enlightenment before he makes a move in any line. He will not trust to his own finite intelligence or to his own wisdom to devise and plan. He will be sick and sore over his past poor performance and inefficient experience.",
