    "word": "A Large Temperance Meeting\n     On Sunday, by request of the president of the temperance society, I spoke upon the subject of temperance. The meeting was held in the soldiers\u2019 military gymnasium, the largest hall in the city. An American flag was placed as a canopy above the pulpit; this was an attention which I highly appreciated. There were about sixteen hundred assembled. Among them was a bishop of the State Church, with a number of the clergy; a large proportion were of the better class of society.",
