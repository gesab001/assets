    "word": "Ministers Enlist Churches in Evangelism.-- Sometimes ministers do too much; they seek to embrace the whole work in their arms. It absorbs and dwarfs them; yet they continue to grasp it all. They seem to think that they alone are to work in the cause of God, while the members of the church stand idle. This is not God's order at all.--Review and Herald, Nov. 18, 1884. \n                                                                           114",
