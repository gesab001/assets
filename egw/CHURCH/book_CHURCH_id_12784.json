    "word": "Through all ages Christ has come to His people, as He represents Himself in the market place at all hours of the day employing laborers for His vineyard, and He says to them, \"Why stand ye here all the day idle? Go labor today in my vineyard.\" But how forcible is this parable in these days when we are near the close of earth's history. Well may we pray as never before both in our closets and in the church, that One mightier than the potentates of earth may stand at the helm.",
