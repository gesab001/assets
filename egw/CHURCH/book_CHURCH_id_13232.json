    "word": "MR No. 1333 - Diary Fragment - February to May, 1902; The Spirit of Thanksgiving; Importance of Unity\n\n     St. Helena, Calif., Feb. 2, 1902. I have much that I should be thankful for this day. I am at home and I praise the Lord for His great goodness in keeping me from harm. Again I am in my own home. We are having some cold weather, but no blizzards; some fog a portion of the day. It is not really fog, but the sky is hazy. I am not sleeping well. I am speaking before congregations in my visions in the night season. Many are represented to me as all ready to hear in new places where the truth has not been. What shall we answer in that day to our Redeemer, for our neglect is made apparent. Wherever there is a church organized in any place, the members are to be educated by men of God's appointment to win others to the truth.",
