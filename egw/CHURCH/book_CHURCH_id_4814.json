He did not follow merely one method; in various ways He sought to gain the attention of the multitude, and having succeeded in this, He proclaimed to them the truths of the gospel. His chief work lay in ministering to the poor, the needy, and the ignorant. In simplicity He opened before them the blessings they might receive, and thus he aroused their soul's hunger for the truth, the bread of life.--RH Dec. 24, 1914.",
