    "word": "The Mission of Our Sanitariums \n\n     \"I have a message to bear to the church members in Southern California. Arouse, and avail yourselves of the opportunities open to you. While Christ pleads in your behalf, plead for yourselves that you may be purified from every unrighteous thought, every unholy action. Make an entire surrender to God, of body, soul, and spirit. Be determined to do all in your power to learn the true science of soul-saving. While the light of God's day of mercy still shines, gather up every divine ray.",
