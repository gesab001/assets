    "word": "On Sabbath morning I went to the church, intending to speak. I found two stoves in the meeting room, one on either side midway between the door and the pulpit. Fires were burning in each of these. Sabbath school had just been held in the room, and, owing to the imperfect ventilation, the atmosphere was very impure. I felt the effect of this as soon as I entered. My heart began to pain. I could not breathe freely and I knew that exhaustion was coming over me.",
