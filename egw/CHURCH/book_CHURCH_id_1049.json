    "word": "God has called His church in this day, as He called ancient Israel, to stand as a light in the earth. By the mighty cleaver of truth\u2014the messages of the first, second, and third angels\u2014He has separated them from the churches and from the world to bring them into a sacred nearness to Himself. He has made them the depositaries of His law and has committed to them the great truths of prophecy for this time. Like the holy oracles committed to ancient Israel, these are a sacred trust to be communicated to the world.",
