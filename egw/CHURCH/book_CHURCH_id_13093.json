    "word": "In these countries where the Catholic element prevails, the people are the lowest in morals and steeped in ignorance. Sunday is to them a festival, a day for sports, for all kinds of amusements. The people attend the service in church one hour in the day, then their religious observance of the day is at an end. Stores are open all through Nimes as on any of the other days that have no sacredness in their minds attached to them.",
