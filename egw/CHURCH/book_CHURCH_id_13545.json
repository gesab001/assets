    "word": "The ascension of Jesus to the Father was a matter of rejoicing to the early church. It enabled the Saviour to vouchsafe to His followers in a special sense, through the agency of the Holy Spirit, His guidance and protection. The promise of the Father concerning His Son had been, \"He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.\" At the close of His work on earth the Saviour could say, \"I have finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do. And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.\"",
