    "word": "Just before His ascension, Christ gave His disciples a wonderful presentation, as recorded in the twenty-eighth chapter of Matthew. This chapter contains instruction that our ministers, our physicians, our youth, and all our church members need to study most earnestly. Those who study this instruction as they should will not dare advocate theories that have no foundation in the Word of God. My brethren and sisters, make the Scriptures, which contain the alpha and the omega of knowledge, your study. All through the Old Testament and the New there are things that are not half understood.",
