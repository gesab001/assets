    "word": "Some Accuse Others to Quiet Their Own Conscience \n     There are to be found in the church those who are unconverted. They are to be pitied. But shall the church be judged as sustaining these? Should they be expelled, those who made them a stumbling block would make them a stumbling block still, because they had been unmercifully treated. If the truth were known, these complaints are made to quiet a condemned conscience. Those who make them know that their own course of action is not commendable.--Manuscript 49, 1893, p. 9. (Written October 28, 1893, from Gisborne, New Zealand.) \n\n\n                                  -158-",
