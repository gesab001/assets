    "word": "God will use you when you are willing to be used in His appointed way. Remember that the church of believers constitutes the body of Christ and \"that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another\" (verse 25). God calls upon you to unite with your brethren. He has assigned different gifts to the different members of His body. He has given them such talents and opportunities as will best promote His glory and the advancement of His kingdom. He is put to shame when the members of His body work contrary one to the other.",
