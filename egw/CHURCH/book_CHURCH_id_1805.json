    "word": "Satan is busy in this department of his work, scattering literature which is debasing the morals and poisoning the minds of the young.  Infidel publications are scattered broadcast throughout the land.\n116\nWhy should not every member of the church be as deeply interested in sending forth publications that will elevate the minds of the people, and bring the truth directly before them?  These papers and tracts are for the light of the world, and have often been instrumental in converting souls. Our publications are now sowing the gospel seed, and are instrumental in bringing as many souls to Christ as the preached word. Whole churches have been raised up as the result of their circulation.",
