    "word": "The Lord requests His church to have a higher grade of piety, a more just sense of duty; a clear realization of their obligation to their Creator. All who will read the third chapter of Malachi will see that God calls for systematic contributions from His people. The funds so given will be abundantly blessed. If all whose names are on the church books would give to the Lord a tenth of their increase, as He has prospered them, abundant resources would swell the revenues of the church. God desires even the poorest to give their gifts, small though they may be. By giving as we have been prospered, we acknowledge God's mercy and liberality in supplying our necessities.--MS. 156, 1898. \n\n                                               -",
