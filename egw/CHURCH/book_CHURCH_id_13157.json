    "word": "Lest the enemies of God should triumph over backsliding Israel, God bears long with the waywardness of their leaders, who though grown to the stature of men and women have not put away their childish faults and imperfections; who after having had years of experience still reveal that they are deficient in love, in grace, in purity. For the glory of His own name, not because of the righteousness of His church or because of their obedience to His commandments, God has borne long with His people.",
