    "word": "The newly formed churches will need to be educated. The minister should not devote so much of his time to preaching as to educating. The people are to be taught how to extend the knowledge of the truth. If they do this work successfully, they will labor so diligently that they will have no time or disposition to weaken the hands of their brethren by unkind criticism. Their one desire will be to carry the truth to the regions beyond.--Manuscript 127, 1901, pp. 9, 10. (\"Nature of Building Thoroughness in Work,\" November 26, 1901.)",
