    "word": "Chap. 22 - The Work in the South; Money Wrongly Diverted Plans and Decisions to Be Made Locally\n\nManuscript 37, 1901\n\n     (Talk given in the Review chapel in 1901.) \n\n     We stand in a very responsible position before God. We claim to have advanced light. We claim to be giving the most solemn message ever borne to the world. For some years, as the field has been opened before me, I have felt a great sadness. God designs that there shall be means in His treasury to sustain the work in all its branches. It is represented to me that the barren places in the Lord's vineyard are as a reflection cast upon Him. The contrast between what should be done and what is not done is plain, and upon God is thrown the blame of the neglect. The wickedness of the places in which no standard is raised for God cries out against those who have neglected to advance the work, who have hovered over the churches when the members should be educated to rely upon God and have root in themselves.",
