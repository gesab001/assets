    "word": "I saw that the sale of \"Object Lessons\" opened the way for the establishment of missions. In the church there was a revival of the missionary spirit. An earnest desire to learn how to work for the Lord was shown. Small companies gathered for prayer and Bible study. All moved forward in harmonious action. Believers went to places where the people had little opportunity to hear the Word of God, and gathered the children for Sabbath-school. Efforts were made to help isolated families. Plans were laid for these families to meet with other families for Bible study. Thus the way was opened for light to shine forth from the Word of God.",
