    "word": "Home missionary work has been strangely neglected. Those who have had the greatest reason for earnest, Christlike solicitude for the salvation of their children, have been indifferent to their responsibilities, and have lightly regarded the wants of their households. The responsibility which God has given to men and women as parents, many have shifted from themselves to the Sabbath school worker and to the church influence. \n                                                                           45\nBut each instrumentality has its work, and parents who neglect their part will be weighed in the balances and found wanting.",
