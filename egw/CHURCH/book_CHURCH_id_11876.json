    "word": "There are those who think that it is only to a certain few that talents have been given, and that these few are to be distinguished above their fellows. This is not so. Every member of the church of Christ is the possessor of some special gift. Every one has been given wisdom and tact which fit him to perform some special work. There is a place for every one, a post of duty for every soldier in the Lord's army. All have been entrusted with the goods of heaven. Some have one class of goods and some another. For one to belittle the work and talents of another is to dishonor God. Let the Lord place His own estimate upon the talents entrusted and upon the use made of them.",
