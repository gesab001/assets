    "word": "No man is excusable for being without financial ability. Of many a man it may be said, He is kind, amiable, generous, a good man, a Christian, but he is not qualified to manage his own business. As far as the outlay of means is concerned, he is a mere child. He has not been brought up by his parents to understand and to practice the principles of self-support. Such a man is not fitted to become a physician or a minister. The churches everywhere are suffering through the neglect of parents to train their children, not to self-indulgence and laziness but to the bearing of stern, hard responsibilities. The wicked love to do nothing but use the mind [for pleasure seeking. A desire for self-indulgence] takes possession of the children, and frequently Satan takes control and makes the mind his workshop. The ability needed for service in the family and the church is lacking. Men and women are destitute of the stern virtues required to build up the church. They are not capable of devising methods and plans of a healthful, solid character. They are deficient in the very qualifications essential to the prosperity of the church. It is this kind of education that needs to be changed to an education that is sound and sensible, in harmony with Bible principles.",
