    "word": "The signs of the times are fulfilling in our world, yet the churches generally are represented as slumbering. Shall we not take warning from the experience of the foolish virgins, who when the call came, \"Behold the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him,\" found that they had no oil in their lamps? And while they went to buy oil, the bridegroom went in to the marriage supper with the wise virgins, and the door was shut. When the foolish virgins reached the banqueting hall, they received an unexpected denial. The master of the feast declared, \"I know you not.\" They were left standing without in the empty street, in the blackness of the night.",
