    "word": "Sunday evening a larger hall was obtained and I spoke to a goodly number of outsiders as well as the church. I had much freedom and all listened as if spellbound. I do not choose to speak evenings, but I can see no other way to get the congregation. A collection was taken up which more than covered the expense of the hall. They have a hall engaged for three evenings in the week. This hall was secured for only one evening. It was a dance hall. But there was excellent ventilation. All seemed to be much pleased with the congregation last evening.",
