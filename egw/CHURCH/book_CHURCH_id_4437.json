    "word": "Young men should be qualifying themselves by becoming familiar with other languages, that God may use them as mediums to communicate His saving truth to those of other nations. These young men may obtain a knowledge of other languages even while engaged in laboring for sinners. If they are economical of their time, they can be improving their minds and qualifying themselves for more extended usefulness.

They could devote themselves to the work of translating.-- \"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. 3, p. 204. \n\n                                               -",
