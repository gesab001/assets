    "word": "Working Contrary to Health Principles--There are some professed believers who accept certain portions of the Testimonies as the message of God, while they reject those portions that condemn their favorite indulgences.  Such persons are working contrary to their own welfare and the welfare of the church.  It is essential that we walk in the light while we have the light.  Those who claim to believe in health reform, and yet work counter to its principles in the daily life practice, are hurting their own souls and are leaving wrong impressions upon the minds of believers and unbelievers.--Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 154.",
