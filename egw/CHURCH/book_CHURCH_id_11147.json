Bell in connection with the cause and work of God in Battle Creek. Bro. Bell has qualifications to make a successful teacher. If he had with his adaptation to teaching a sound physical constitution, so that he could at all times preserve calm self-possession, so valuable to a teacher, his services would be of inestimable worth. He loves his work as a teacher, and he gives his whole mind to this work. He has the power to explain, in a variety of ways, by impressive illustrations, principles which would otherwise lose much of their force upon the mind of the pupil.",
