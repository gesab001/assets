    "word": "After dinner we went to the church, where we found a goodly number of people assembled, notwithstanding the fact that it was Christmas day. We praised the Lord that so many were desirous of hearing the truth. I continued my remarks on the second chapter of Colossians, and the Lord gave me freedom. My burden during the meetings of this Week of Prayer has been to impress the people that true service makes believers self-denying and self-sacrificing. They keep in view the need of individual holiness and consecration, that through the sanctification of the truth they may abound in works of benevolence to the uplifting of others.",
