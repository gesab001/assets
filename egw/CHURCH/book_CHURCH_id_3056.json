    "word": "Babylon is said to be \u201cthe mother of harlots.\u201d By her daughters must be symbolized churches that cling to her doctrines and traditions, and follow her example of sacrificing \n383\nthe truth and the approval of God, in order to form an unlawful alliance with the world. The message of Revelation 14 announcing the fall of Babylon, must apply to religious bodies that were once pure and have become corrupt. Since this message follows the warning of the Judgment, it must be given in the last days, therefore it cannot refer to the Romish Church, for that church has been in a fallen condition for many centuries. Furthermore, in the eighteenth chapter of the Revelation, in a message which is yet future, the people of God are called upon to come out of Babylon. According to this scripture, many of God's people must still be in Babylon. And in what religious bodies are the greater part of the followers of Christ now to be found? Without doubt, in the various churches professing the Protestant faith. At the time of their rise, these churches took a noble stand for God and the truth, and his blessing was with them. Even the unbelieving world was constrained to acknowledge the beneficent results that followed an acceptance of the principles of the gospel. In the words of the prophet to Israel, \u201cThy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty; for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.\u201d But they fell by the same desire which was the curse and ruin of Israel,\u2014the desire of imitating the practices and courting the friendship of the ungodly. \u201cThou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown.\u201d",
