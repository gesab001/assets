    "word": "Cleveland is an important place, and if Sabbath-keepers have been raised up there, you will see the necessity of building in order to facilitate the work in that city and vicinity. But who will come to the front now to invest means in this essential enterprise? My brother, you have taken burdens upon yourself that the Lord has not laid upon you. The establishment of the health institution at Mount Vernon was a personal enterprise, and I cannot see the justice of calling means from the Ohio churches to support it, neither can I see any reason why it should be shouldered on the General Conference which has already as many burdens as it can carry. The foreign missions and the continually increasing enterprises for the spread of the truth requires a large outlay of means, the exercise of careful thought, the disciplining of efficient forces to carry out their plans, and all these things make care enough without adding superfluous burdens.",
