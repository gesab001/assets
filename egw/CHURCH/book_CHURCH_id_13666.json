    "word": "Two o'clock p.m. W.C.W. spoke for a hack to take me to ride--the first time I have had a ride in a carriage for four weeks. We had a very pleasant ride two hours long. We saw a curiously constructed church, a state church, about three hundred years old. It is most curiously constructed. It has been presented to the king of Norway. Close by was an old, rough-looking building with curious specimens of antique crockery, brass and tin waiters [trays], plates, and various articles of wearing apparel and utensils.",
