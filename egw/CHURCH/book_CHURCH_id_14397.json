The ears will no longer be open to reports that will injure your neighbor, and no one will take up a reproach against his neighbor. The members of the church will cherish love and unity, and be as one great family. Then we shall bear the divine credentials to the world, that will testify that God has sent His Son into the world. Christ has said, \"By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one for another\" (John 13:35). The divinity of Christ is acknowledged in the unity of the children of God.",
