Kellogg.) \n\n     We have come to a time when church members grieve the Lord by searching into scientific problems that make void the past experience of the people of God. And because they cannot have the influence they desire to have over minds to sway them in the same channel, which they suppose is an evidence of higher education, they become dissatisfied. They suppose that with their superficial minds they can comprehend God and His working, when they cannot comprehend the past facts of faith. It is to such that the instruction is given that is contained in the first three chapters of Revelation. Let our churches read and study this instruction, lest they follow a course that God condemns.",
