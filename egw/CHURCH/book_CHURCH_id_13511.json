    "word": "When the gospel net draws, it gathers both good and bad. God sees the distinction, and those who have discernment will see it also. The members of God's church may be poor, illiterate, obscure, and unknown, but if they love Jesus, if they pray earnestly, their prayers are heard although they have no wealth or much education. They may not know from one week to another where they will obtain their bread, but if they walk reverently before God, seeking by humble prayer to know and do His will, the hiding of God's power is with them. Their influence \n\n\n                                     -33- \n\nis saving, and will be felt throughout eternity. Their light does not flicker a little, and then go out. They reveal the similitude of Christ by watching to see how they can be a blessing to others. Wherever they go, their light shines. By them Christ is glorified and His kingdom advanced.",
