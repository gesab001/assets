    "word": "But as the church approaches its final deliverance, Satan is to work with greater power. He comes down \u201chaving great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time\u201d (Revelation 12:12). . . . For six thousand years that mastermind that once was highest among the angels of God has been wholly bent to the work of deception and ruin. And all the depths of satanic skill and subtlety acquired, all the cruelty developed, during these struggles of the ages, will be brought to bear against God\u2019s people in the final conflict.",
