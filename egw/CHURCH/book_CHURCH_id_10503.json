    "word": "Schools Should Be Established. \nFor each church. \n\n\n     \"In all our churches, and wherever there is a company of believers, church schools should be established, and in these schools there should be teachers with a true missionary spirit, for the children are to be trained to become missionaries. It is essential that the teachers be educated to act their part in instructing children of Sabbath-keepers not only in the sciences, but in the Scriptures. These schools, established in different localities, and conducted by God-fearing men and women, as the case demands, should be built upon the same principles as were the schools of the prophets.\"--P. C., \"Need of Church Schools.\"",
