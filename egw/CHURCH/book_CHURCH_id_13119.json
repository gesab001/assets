    "word": "Brother Albert, I have tried to shield you before the church and before those who love to talk. I hope I have not carried the matter too far in trying to shield you. I fear I have. I fear that the course I have taken will cause some to doubt the truthfulness of the visions and think me partial. I was shown that many were jealous of you, and this is one apology for my doing as I have done. But now as I speak directly to you I dare not spare you. Your imprudence has been highly censurable in the sight of God. May the Lord tear off the veil which has blinded you and let you see all things clearly. \n\n\n                                    -160-",
