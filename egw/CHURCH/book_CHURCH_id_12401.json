    "word": "Brother Jones, instruction has been given to me to the effect that you are careless in your speech, and that your words must be more carefully chosen. You must remember that you are certainly dishonoring God when you use His entrusted talent of speech, which should be consecrated and holy, in such a way that it is a stumbling block to our people. Those who refuse to hear the admonitions and warnings given by God's faithful messengers are not to be retained in the church. They are to be disfellowshipped, for they will be as Achan in the camp of Israel--deceived and deceiving.",
