    "word": "We have a little cottage of six rooms all furnished and the weekly rent, which is one pound five shillings sterling. The church have kindly hired us a horse and phaeton, for which they pay a pound sterling a week. We feed the horse and as Elder [A. G.] Daniells is with us, he cares for him. Nearly every day I ride. We have been having considerable rain and clouds \n\n\n                                 -340- \n\nand cool weather. The inhabitants say it is generally very hot here at this season.",
