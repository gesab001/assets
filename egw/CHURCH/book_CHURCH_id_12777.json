    "word": "We greatly need men who can both sow and reap, who can gather souls unto eternal life. I am glad to see that Elder Simpson is of good courage. Oh, that the church members who have been long in the truth would feel such a burden for souls that, as Elder Simpson leaves Los Angeles, they might continue a work that would gather in a harvest of souls. Workers are greatly needed just now in Los Angeles. I pray for men who can continue the work with those who are interested. After working for a time in San Diego, I think Elder Simpson will be ready to go to Redlands and Riverside.",
