    "word": "The Christian physician cannot maintain a supreme regard for his own individuality, acting in his profession without reference to his accountability to God or the relation he sustains to the cause of God at large. He should not enter upon important enterprises, such as the establishment of a sanitarium, upon his own independent judgment. The physicians employed in our institutions should have a sacred regard for honor and loyalty. If they fail to walk uprightly, if they do not honor the principles that should control the followers of Christ, then let the church take action in their case. Let the Bible rule be followed just as the Master, Christ Jesus, has taught.",
