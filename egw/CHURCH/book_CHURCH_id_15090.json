    "word": "On Sabbath, April 24, I spoke to the people in the Memorial Church. What good will result to our workers in the publishing house, and how the word spoken will be received, we cannot now determine. The Lord gave me largely of His Holy Spirit, and I spoke for about one hour. I feel that a special work needs to be done in the printing office. This has been plainly revealed to me. The workers there are not all in working order. They do not perceive that the work is a sacred one, and one that is essential for the salvation of their own souls and for the saving work that must be done throughout the world. Unless they themselves are worked by the Holy Spirit\u2019s power, their influence will be of a nature to dishonor God. We are not to make some wonderful effort to do some wonderful thing that will exalt self. I have worked strenuously to correct this evil which is threatening the pure, true work of God. I have been shown that our leading men must know that they are themselves led of the Lord, for unless they are, they will fall into grievous errors.",
