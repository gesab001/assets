    "word": "Leaders to be Examples--All parents should strive to make their families patterns of good works, perfect Christian households.  But in a pre-eminent degree is this the duty of those who minister in sacred things, and to whom the people look for instruction and guidance?  The ministers of Christ are to be examples to the flock.  He who fails to direct his own household, is not qualified to guide the church of God.--SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 2, p. 1009. (Statement, Nov. 10, 1881).",
