    "word": "Many Will Go From Us, Giving Heed to Seducing Spirits. A superficial faith results in a superficial experience. . . . The light given me has been very forcible that many would go out from us, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils. The Lord desires that every soul who \n\n\n                                     -353- \n\nclaims to believe the truth shall have an intelligent knowledge of what is truth. False prophets will arise, and will deceive many. Everything is to be shaken that can be shaken. Then does it not become every one to understand the reasons of our faith? In place of having so many sermons, there should be a more close searching of the Word of God, opening the Scriptures text by text, and searching for the strong evidence that sustain the fundamental doctrines that have brought us where we now are, upon the platform of eternal truth.--Letter 1, 1897, pp. 1, 2. (To the church in Adelaide, April 22, 1897.)",
