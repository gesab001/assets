    "word": "I cannot see anything unkind or unreasonable in the letter of Brother Vuilleumier to you. The enemy has perverted this matter to your mind. I see in his letter only that which is consistent for a father to write when the interest and happiness of his daughter are concerned. As you have been instrumental in making this matter known to quite a number, and as your feelings toward Brother Vuilleumier have not been as they should have been, and as some in the church have unwisely given you their sympathy and support, this matter has become quite serious, and demands careful consideration.",
