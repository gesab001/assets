    "word": "The use of images by the Roman Catholic Church is antichristian. Those who worship them are commandment-breakers. Image worship is contrary to God's positive commands. The second commandment is entirely opposed to such practices. But the popes have tampered with the commandments. In all the books of devotion given to the people the second commandment is omitted. The third they call the second, the fourth the third; and the tenth they have divided into two. Thus in the place of conforming their practices to God's commands, they have altered His commandments to harmonize with their practices. To suit their worship they have taken away from and added to God's Word.",
