    "word": "I am very anxious that we shall begin the new year by consecrating our whole being to God. Let every church member offer himself [as] a humble offering to the Lord. Parents, bring your children to the Lord. Be determined to seek God with all the heart, and make a full surrender of yourselves to Him. Pray, and believe the promises of God. Seek for the grace of Christ that you may be taught His way and His will. As fathers and mothers a sacred work is yours to remove every stumbling block from the path of your children. Then the Lord can work. My brethren and sisters, labor for your own souls and for the souls of others, that you may be accounted laborers together with God.",
