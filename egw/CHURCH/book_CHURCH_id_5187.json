    "word": "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. The eye of faith will discern God very near, and the suppliant may obtain precious evidence of the divine love and care for him. But why is it that so many prayers are never answered? Says David: \u201cI cried unto Him with my mouth, and He was extolled with my tongue. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.\u201d By another prophet the Lord gives us the promise: \u201cYe shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart.\u201d Again, he speaks of some who \u201chave not cried unto Me with their heart.\u201d Such petitions are prayers of form, lip service only, which the Lord does not accept.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, 533.)",
