    "word": "It is not enough to worship God on the Sabbath. The religious services held on that day should be of an uplifting character. Those who preach the truth should be able to present it with power because they live it in the daily life. The church members should carry the influence of the correct observance of the Sabbath through every day of the week, in all their business relations and in all their home relations. They are to be Christians, controlled by the will of God, exemplifying the perfection of Christ's character.--Letter 66, 1900, pp. 1, 2. (To W. L. H. Baker, May 2, 1900.) \n\nReleased March 11, 1975.",
