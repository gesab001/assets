    "word": "The Lord desires His people to arise, and do their appointed work. The responsibility rests not upon the ministry alone. The lay members of the church are to share the burdens of soul saving. . . . The Lord now calls upon those who have a knowledge of the truth for this time, to arouse from their lethargy, and become true missionaries in His service. Time is short, and the Lord's work must be done without further delay.--Letter 4, Feb. 15, 1911, to W. C. White.",
