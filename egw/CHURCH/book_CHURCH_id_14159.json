    "word": "When about to leave His disciples, Christ was in search of the greatest comfort He could give them. He promised them the Holy Spirit-- the Comforter--to combine with man's human effort. What promise is less experienced, less fulfilled to the church, than the promise of the Holy Spirit? When this blessing, which would bring all blessings in its train, is dropped out, the sure result is spiritual drought. This is the reproach that meets the sermonizer. The church must arise and no longer be content with the meager dew.",
