    "word": "When these words are heeded and obeyed in the spirit and in the letter, we will be doers of the word, and not hearers only. When these words are practised by those who claim to have wisdom to guide the sheep of the Lord's pasture, there will be far less selfishness, far less boasting, far less putting forth the finger and speaking vanity. Jesus is to superintend all events in the present and future of his church. John was instructed to write the things which he had seen \"and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches; and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.\"",
