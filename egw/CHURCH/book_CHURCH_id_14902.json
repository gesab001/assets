    "word": "I am pained that there are not more decided efforts put forth to win souls to a belief of the truth. I am pained at the indifference manifested in our institutions established for the care of the sick, by many who know the truth. Many who come to these institutions are ignorant of the great life and death question, and they need to be enlightened. But among those connected with our sanitariums there seems to be a lack of earnest seeking after God, that they may speak words that will exert an influence for the truth. This is a work too often left undone in our churches and in our health institutions. Those connected with these institutions should be representatives of Christ.",
