    "word": "The Lord foretells the going forth of deceivers. He cautioned His disciples to be wide-awake regarding the signs of the times. Instead of revealing that which would have tended to arouse their curiosity over matters that they were unprepared to handle or to discuss with profit, He gave them decided instruction as to what they ought to do in order to be prepared for the events that would take place. And this instruction that He gave His disciples has come down through the centuries to our time. The warnings that we find recorded in Holy Writ regarding the perils which would always surround the Christian church, belong to the people that are especially concerned in all these things. Christ foretold that the going forth of deceivers would be accompanied with more danger to His disciples than would persecution.",
