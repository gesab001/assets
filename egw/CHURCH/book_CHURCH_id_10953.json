    "word": "Real-Estate Speculation. \n\n     We are trading with our Lord's goods. Phariseeism will appear in abundance. But a formal church will have far less to account for in the sight of God than those who have had so great light, so many opportunities, and yet are found among transgressors. Vice and dishonesty in trade have prevailed in Battle Creek and have been carried to other cities. Their speculation in lands, their attempts to secure money by making glowing representations, have in nearly every case proved a fraud. Their broker's business is an acted lie. The church bears the sin and disgrace of all such business done by its members.",
