    "word": "The gift of His Holy Spirit, rich, full, and abundant, is to His church as an encompassing wall of fire, and the powers of hell shall not prevail against it. In their untainted purity and spotless perfection Christ looks upon His people as the reward of all His suffering, His humiliation, and His love, and the supplement of His glory--Christ the great center from which radiates all glory.--Home Missionary, Nov. 1, 1893.",
