    "word": "When I think of the opportunity we now have to work Portland, Maine, and many other cities in the East, I cannot hold my peace. This is why I have appealed to the church at Mountain View and to churches in several other places, to help our brethren in Portland to erect a meetinghouse. Because of their poverty they cannot advance as rapidly as they desire, and unless someone helps, the work is liable to be greatly retarded. We believe that many will respond to this appeal.",
