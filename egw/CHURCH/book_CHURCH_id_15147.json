    "word": "My brother, I feel deeply over the mistake of locating so many important interests at Battle Creek. There is a world to receive the light of truth. Had interests been located in cities where nothing is being done, the warning message would be given to other cities. You have asked me in regard to the schools being opened in our churches. I have tried to answer you. That light which has centered in Battle Creek should have been shining in other localities. Schools should have been opened in places where they are so much needed. This will provide for the children and youth who are drifting in to Battle Creek. Let the church carry a burden for the lambs of the flock in its locality, and see how many can be educated and trained to do service for God. \n\n\n                                  (Signed) E. G. White \n\n\n                               -104-",
