    "word": "Not Revealed to Just One or Two.--God has not passed His people by, and chosen one solitary man here and another there as the only ones worthy to be entrusted with His truth. He does not give one man new light contrary to the established faith of the body. In every reform men have arisen making this claim. Paul warned the church in his day, \"Of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.\" The greatest harm to God's people comes through those who go out from among them speaking perverse things. Through them the way of truth is evil spoken of.",
