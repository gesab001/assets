    "word": "The light that has been imparted from heaven, that has lighted up our pathway, has been appreciated only by a few. The many have regarded heaven's benefits as though they came as a matter of course, and have not walked in the light, following the footsteps of their Leader. The piety of the church as a whole has not been what it should be. The members of the church have not increased in power, imparting and receiving grace. It is when human agents seek for ability to do the work of God as it should be done that they become successful, persevering agents in advancing His cause. They become aggressive, persistent, and manifest personal piety. Those who advocate truth must live in harmony with the profession they make. It is the truth appropriated that sanctifies the soul. It is the faith that works by love that purifies from every species of selfishness. When the members of the church have this manner of faith, they recognize their mutual obligation and dependence.",
