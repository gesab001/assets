    "word": "My son, you will never be placed where you will have no provocation from the strife of tongues. I am suffering this continually, and more recently especially from one, McCullagh by name, whom I have treated as tenderly as though it had been you, my son, in his place. In all our relations with each other in the past, no word or action has been unpleasant. He has been treated as a son in regard to careful tenderness. He and his wife have been made as welcome to my table as yourself and Emma. He claimed to have perfect faith in the work the Lord has given me to do. He was ever seeking my counsel, for often all the churches in New South Wales were left to our care.",
