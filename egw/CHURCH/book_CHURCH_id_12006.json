    "word": "I address this letter to the several churches and companies of believers in Greater New York. God help you to walk in the light. Walk so that your life will reflect rays of light to others. If you work as God designs you should, many of such as shall be saved will be added to your numbers. Confide in the love of Jesus, and you will have grace to save perishing souls. Your path will be as the path of the just--\"a shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\"--Letter 98, 1902. (To the Churches and Companies in Greater New York, July 8, 1902.)",
