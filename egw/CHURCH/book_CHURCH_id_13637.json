    "word": "We see that all the interest now manifested means work; it requires great wisdom, more fervent prayer and better ability to devise and execute. Meetinghouses must be built to accommodate those who shall come out from the popular churches. We must educate the believers to have root in themselves. We want devoted, godly men who will live the truth and whose example will be such as shall recommend the truth to others. But I must close this long epistle. May the Lord bless you and yours is my prayer.--Ms 6, 1894. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nFebruary 28, 1991. Entire Ms.",
