    "word": "Through the efforts that have been put forth by faithful workers, churches have been raised up among the colored people in the South. When the company in Vicksburg, who had received the truth under the labors of Elder J. E. White and his associates, met for the dedication of their church, I was present with them, and the Lord gave me freedom in speaking to those assembled. Quite a large number of persons from other churches were present, and many of them were surprised to see the neatly dressed women, and to hear the excellent singing. These colored people had learned to know that Christ had died for them, and their hearts were glad in the truth. They bore sincere testimonies to the goodness of the Lord. My heart rejoiced as I saw these converts to the faith. And this is an illustration of what can be accomplished in other places for this people.",
