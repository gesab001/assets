    "word": "Let the teachers who claim to be Christians be learning daily in the school of Christ his lessons. \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" I ask you, Is every educator in the school wearing the yoke of Christ, or manufacturing yokes of his own to place upon the necks of others, yokes which they themselves will not wear, sharp, severe, exacting; and this, too, while they are carrying themselves very loosely toward God, offending every day in little and larger matters, and making it evident in words, in spirit, and in actions, that they are not a proper example for the students, and are not having a sense that they are under discipline to the greatest Teacher the world ever knew. There needs to be a higher, holier mold on the school in Battle Creek, and in other schools which have taken their mold from it. The customs and practices of the Battle Creek school go forth to all the churches, and the pulse heart-beats of that school are felt throughout the body of believers.",
