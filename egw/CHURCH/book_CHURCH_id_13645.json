    "word": "I feel deeply in regard to the fact that our people talk the truth, but do not live the truth, thus carrying its principles in their life practices. Every church that has been organized needs a work done for them that God alone can do. They talk consecration, mention consecration in their prayers, and say over and over again, \"We give ourselves wholly to Christ,\" when they hold tenaciously to their own ideas and will and are not consecrated to Christ.",
