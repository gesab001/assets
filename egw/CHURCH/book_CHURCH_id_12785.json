    "word": "There is but one Scriptural way in which to deal with men when they introduce unsafe doctrines, and it has been enjoined upon the church by the Lord Jesus Christ. We are to strive by every power of our being to come into harmony with our brethren, because Christ has prayed that His disciples might be one as He and the Father are one. When we follow the injunction of Christ, cooperating with Him so as to bring about a condition among us that will answer the prayer of Christ, then we are doing the will of God; but when we disregard those rules that when followed will prevent discord and alienation, we scatter from Christ.",
