    "word": "The best help which the minister can give to \n\n                       - 20 - \n\nthe church is not all in sermonising, but planning work for them. Give each one something to do for others. Show them that as receivers of the grace of God, all are under obligation to work for Him. And let all be taught how to work. Especially should those who are newly come to the faith be educated to become labourers together with God. If set to work, the despondent would soon forget their despondency; the weak would become strong, the ignorant intelligent, and all would be prepared to present the truth as it is in Jesus. They would find an unfailing helper in Him who has promised to save all who come unto Him.",
