Amadon: \n\n\n     I wish to say to you and to the leading men in the church: and to the trustees of the Tabernacle, that light has been given to me very distinctly that Elder A. T. Jones has taken a position that divorces him from the privileges of the use of the Tabernacle. He does not know what spirit is leading him. Efforts are being made in an underhand way to get possession of the Tabernacle.",
