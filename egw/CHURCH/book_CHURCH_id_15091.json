    "word": "On Sunday, April 25, I was greatly strengthened and blessed while speaking to the colored people in their church on Winter Street. The Lord gave me words to speak, and much satisfaction was expressed because of the blessing that the hearers received. When I had finished, Edson spoke for a short time. At the close of the meeting I went to Madison, where a teachers\u2019 convention was in progress. It seemed to give great pleasure to our workers there that I could have the advantages of their new sanitarium.",
