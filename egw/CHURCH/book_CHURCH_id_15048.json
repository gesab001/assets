The year was 1896. A 360-acre plot in Huntsville, Alabama, the site of a former slave plantation, was chosen as a location for the first Seventh-day Adventist advanced school for Blacks. The Alabama landscape was sloping and uneven; the red clay was hard as granite; dense brush encircled the property; the limbs of the trees sagged; derelict brush lay strewn all over; and the soil was barren from having been overworked. It took vision and faith to see a future in this unpromising plot in Alabama in the heart of the South 30 years after the Civil War. {PCO i.2} \n     To make matters more challenging, barely enough funds were on hand to buy the property, let alone start a school. The General Conference was pressed for money, and church leaders would be slow to funnel funds into an enterprise such as this. Conditions did not look good. {PCO i.3} \n     In the midst of this challenging situation, a clarion voice was heard. It was a voice that spoke for God, convinced that this was the spot the Lord would have the denomination purchase for a school to train blacks to be workers in His vineyard. {PCO i.4} \n     From the start Ellen G. White championed Oakwood\u2019s cause. Unquestionably she is worthy of the title \u201ccofounder of Oakwood.\u201d Throughout the subsequent years, as Oakwood grew, Ellen White continually spoke out for the school, doing all in her power to make sure it prospered. She wrote, visited, prodded, sacrificed, prayed, donated, advocated, and cried for the fledgling institution to ever fulfill its God-given destiny. As a result of her efforts and the support of the General Conference, and subsequently the support of the Regional conferences, Oakwood College is the success it is today. {PCO i.5} \n     This volume is a comprehensive collection of Ellen G. White\u2019s written statements (published and unpublished) on Oakwood, or \u201cthe Huntsville School,\u201d as she often referred to it.  {PCO i.6} \n     Her words still instruct and encourage administrators, faculty, staff, students, alumni and supporters with timeless counsel and inspiration for \u201ca place called Oakwood.\u201d {PCO i.7} \nBenjamin J. Baker\n\nOakwood Keys\n\nKeys to Unlock Ellen G. White\u2019s Oakwood Statements\n\nKey Terms\n\n     Colored people: This was the popular designation for African-Americans in the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth century. In context, the term Colored people was not necessarily derogatory or demeaning. {PCO ii.1} \n     Farm: This frequently used term refers to the Oakwood training school and to the Oakwood property. {PCO ii.2} \n     Huntsville School: Before the name Oakwood was adopted, the school was popularly referred to as the Huntsville School. {PCO ii.3} \n     Southern cause: This term refers to the Seventh-day Adventist denominational effort to evangelize and educate the recently freed slaves in the southern part of the United States. This cause was championed by Ellen White, her son James Edson, selected workers in the Southern field and broader church, black workers and leaders like Charles Kinney. {PCO ii.4} \n\nKey Individuals\n\n     George I. Butler (1834-1918): One of the pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist movement, Butler served in many positions in the church, most notably as General Conference president from 1871-1874 and 1880-1888.  Butler received more letters from Ellen White than anyone else mentioning the Oakwood School. When she wrote these letters, he was the president of the Southern Union Conference and the Southern Publishing Association. {PCO ii.5} \n     Arthur G. Daniells (1858-1935): Longtime church worker and administrator, Daniells held several key denominational positions and was one of Seventh-day Adventism\u2019s most dynamic leaders. He served as General Conference president from 1901-1921, holding that position longer than anyone else. {PCO ii.6} \n     Solon M. Jacobs (1846-1927): The first principal of the Oakwood School, Jacobs was a white man from Fontanelle, Iowa. Jacobs and his family arrived at Oakwood in 1896. The Jacobs\u2019 were tireless workers, doing anything and everything possible to keep the school running. Jacobs stayed on as principal one year, then served as the farm foreman until 1902. {PCO ii.7} \n     Benjamin E. Nicola (1856-1943): Oakwood\u2019s principal from 1899-1904, Nicola was the first principal to serve for longer than two years. (The two subsequent presidents would not stay longer than two years either.) The school made significant strides during his years in office, but he would receive reproving counsel from Mrs. White concerning his tenure. {PCO ii.8} \n     Fred R. Rogers (1869-1920) Rogers served as Oakwood\u2019s principal from 1904-1905. Before taking up his post at Oakwood, Rogers was a diligent worker in the Southern cause, serving as the superintendent of SDA mission schools in Mississippi, and working with James Edson White and his Morning Star boat crew. {PCO ii.9} \n     James Edson White (1849-1928): The second son of James and Ellen White, Edson was the premier champion of the Southern cause. He began his evangelistic efforts in 1894 by constructing an innovative steamboat called the Morning Star. He sailed the steamer from city to city along the Mississippi River, leaving SDA schools and churches for black people in his wake. He chose this witnessing medium for safety, mobility, and drawing appeal. Edson compiled his mother\u2019s writings on the Southern cause into one handy volume called The Southern Work. Edson\u2019s successes and influence helped to facilitate the establishment of Oakwood. {PCO ii.10} \n\nKey Places\n\n     Graysville, Tennessee: This small country town was where George A. Colcord opened a Seventh-day Adventist school in 1891. Then a boarding academy with an adjacent sanitarium, Graysville Academy would move to property east of Chattanooga and become Southern Junior College, then Southern Missionary College, and finally Southern Adventist University. This area was a crucial spot in the early days of the movement in the training of Adventist workers. It is centrally located, roughly one hundred miles from both Nashville and Huntsville. {PCO iii.1} \n     Huntsville, Alabama: The home of the Oakwood educational institution, the first Seventh-day Adventist higher education institution for African Americans. Huntsville, Alabama, is a city that has historically been noted for being progressive in its racial views and, more recently, for its  technological advancement. It was/is an ideal location for the Oakwood educational enterprise. Huntsville, situated in the northern part of Alabama, is the southern part of the Nashville-Huntsville-Graysville triangle. {PCO iii.2} \n     Madison, Tennessee: Located ten miles northeast of Nashville, Madison was an important spot in early Southern Seventh-day Adventism. The Madison property (often referred to as the Madison Farm) was purchased in 1904 with the financial assistance of Nellie Druillard and the prophetic vision of Ellen White. Spearheaded by Edward A. Sutherland and Percy T. Magan, the Madison contingent would spawn a collection of schools, hospitals, industries and churches around the South. {PCO iii.3} \n     Nashville, Tennessee: The capital of Tennessee, Nashville was the hub of the burgeoning Southern work in the Seventh-day Adventist movement. Home of the first black congregation, at Edgefield Junction, Nashville would also later become home to two SDA conferences (Gulf States Conference and South Central Conference) and the first SDA hospital for blacks (Riverside Sanitarium). A major factor in the location of schools at Huntsville and Graysville was their proximity to Nashville. {PCO iii.4} \n\nKey References\n\n     Self-denial boxes: These were small boxes in the homes of Seventh-day Adventists in which monetary contributions were to be placed for the black work in the South. This innovative practice was encouraged by Ellen White in 1904. {PCO iv.1} \n     The fire: On October 11, 1906, Chapel Hall on the Oakwood campus was totally consumed by fire. One student, Will (aka John, Alfred) Willingham, perished. No one else was harmed. {PCO iv.2} \n     The orphanage: Upon the urging of Ellen White, Oakwood assumed management of an orphanage constructed by Mrs. Stephen N. Haskell in 1911. This orphanage took in black children of unfortunate backgrounds, caring for and educating them. A number of the orphans would later attend the Oakwood primary and training school. The orphanage closed its doors in 1930. {PCO iv.3} \n     The sanitarium: Also started as a result of the counsel of Ellen White, the Oakwood Sanitarium, a modest two-story building, began a nursing and medical training program in the summer of 1910 under the leadership of Martin M. Martinson. The sanitarium trained nurses and medical workers and offered medical assistance to the community at large. The sanitarium had a tumultuous history, and in 1937 it was closed. {PCO iv.4} \n\nOakwood Names\n\nOfficial Names of Oakwood\n     Oakwood Industrial School (1896) Oakwood Manual Training School (1904) Oakwood Junior College (1917) Oakwood College (1943) {PCO v.1} \nNames for Oakwood used by Ellen White\n     Huntsville Huntsville School Farm our school for the colored people our school in Huntsville the farm the Huntsville School the Industrial School the institution at Huntsville the Lord\u2019s farm the Oakwood enterprises the Oakwood Farm? the Oakwood School the Oakwood School Farm the school the school at Huntsville the school here at Huntsville Training School {PCO v.2} \n\nOakwood Timeline\n\nThe Early Years: 1891-1915\n     This chronological outline of key events pertaining to Oakwood covers the 25-year period from 1891 to 1915, the year of Ellen White\u2019s death (July 16, 1915). {PCO vi.1} \n1891\n     Ellen White delivers historic address \u201cOur Duty to the Colored People\u201d to the General Conference session in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1891 in which she urges the church to develop the work in the South. {PCO vi.2} \n1893\n     Edson White reads Our Duty to the Colored People for the first time in tract form and dedicates his life to the black work in the South. {PCO vi.3} \n1894\n     Edson White and Will Palmer via the Morning Star steamship begin to educate and evangelize Southern Blacks and found mission schools that later became feeder schools for Oakwood. {PCO vi.4} \n1895\n     Premier black SDA pioneer Charles M. Kinney recommends the Beasley estate as the site for Oakwood. {PCO vi.5} \n     Southern Missionary Society, devoted to working for Blacks in the South, is begun, headed by Edson White. This organization is the precursor to the Southern Union Conference and was a strong supporter of Oakwood. {PCO vi.6} \n     Ellen White encourages General Conference leaders to move forward with the Oakwood School. {PCO vi.7} \nAutumn 1895\n     The General Conference sends Ole A. Olsen, George A. Irwin, and Harmon Lindsay to assess the Beasley estate. {PCO vi.8} \nJanuary 23, 1896\n     The Huntsville property is purchased by the General Conference. {PCO vi.9} \nApril 3, 1896\n     Solon Jacobs arrives to become the first principal of the Oakwood Industrial School. {PCO vi.10} \nNovember 16, 1896\n     Oakwood Industrial School opens. {PCO vi.11} \n     Boys\u2019 dormitory opens. {PCO vi.12} \n1897\n     Henry H.

There are two speeches five years apart (June 21, 1904, and April 19, 1909) that were transcribed and have been preserved. Mrs. White also wrote of these two visits in her diary and personal correspondence. If Mrs. White made additional visits to Oakwood other than in 1904 and 1909, there is no extant record or document to support those visits. Therefore, any other visits to Oakwood by Mrs. White than on these two dates can only be presumed until further evidence is discovered. {PCO viii.5} \n     Ellen White returned to the United States from Australia in 1900. The 1904 and 1909 visits took place when she traveled across the country from Elmshaven, her home a few miles from the town of St. Helena (70 miles north of San Francisco) to Battle Creek, Michigan, and Washington, DC, center of the growing Adventist Church. {PCO viii.6} \n     These trips coincide with the Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia reference that states: {PCO viii.7} \n     \u201cHer journeys across the continent between 1901 and 1909 often took her through the South, where the work of the church was slowly developing. An appeal from her pen in 1891, followed in 1895 and 1896 by articles published in the Review and Herald urging educational and evangelistic endeavors for the neglected black race, sparked a work in which her own son, James Edson White, took an active part. She was keenly interested in the development of missionary endeavors geared for most effective results in white and black communities, and sent the workers in this field many messages of counsel and encouragement. She lent strong support to the establishment of Oakwood College, in Huntsville, Alabama, for black young people, and the Nashville Agricultural and Normal Institute, near Madison, Tennessee, a privately operated training center for mature white young people. The work of the church in the South was of deep concern to her through the remaining years of her life.\u201d [Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia, Second Revised Edition M-Z, Review and Herald Publishing Association, Hagerstown, MD 21740, pp. 879-880.] {PCO viii.8} \n\nOakwood Leaders\n\nOakwood Principals\n\nSolon M.

The compiler has supplied titles for each speech or letter from some words or phrase that appear in the speech or letter. The articles have the original titles appearing in the periodical. The manuscript and testimony titles vary; some are supplied by the compiler (italicized), others by Mrs. White or her original editors. The unpublished document titles are also a mix of original and supplied.  {PCO x.1} \n     SELECTIVITY: At times Mrs. White began a letter with the standard address \u201cDear Brother _______\u201d or \u201cDear Sister ________,\u201d etc. This address is left out of some letters because the selected quotation is so far into the letter that the integrity of the selection would be compromised by giving the address followed by an ellipsis. {PCO x.2} \n     ELLIPSIS: An ellipsis (\u2026) means parts of original text were left out either because of lack of relevancy or manuscript difficulties (the original document contained the ellipsis or the next part is missing from original document or is unclear).
