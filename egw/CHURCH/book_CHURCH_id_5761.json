    "word": "This is the evil which today threatens our schools, our institutions, our churches. Unless corrected, it will imperil the souls of many. One man will think that he should be greatly favored, because he is doing a line of work which among unbelievers would command large wages. Becoming dissatisfied, he will sell himself to the highest bidder. For the safety of the principles that should control all who labor in our institutions, the Lord bids me say to all who carry responsibilities, \"Disconnect from all such without any delay; for this is the evil leaven of selfishness and covetousness.\"",
