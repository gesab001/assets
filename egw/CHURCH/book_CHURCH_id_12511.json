    "word": "MR No. 983 - Counsel on Solving Church Difficulties\n\n     In the vision given me one year ago last fall I was shown many things in regard to the churches in Indiana, in reference to ministers and people; but now I have time to refer to only one church, the church at Ligonier. I saw them in trouble; they were a spectacle to the world, angels, and to men. They professed to be the repositories of God's law, but difficulties and dissensions made them a weak church; and because of their lack of union, they were bringing the precious, sacred truth of God into disrepute.",
