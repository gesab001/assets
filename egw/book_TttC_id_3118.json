    "word": "The prosperity of the cause of God in Minnesota is due more to the labors of Brother Pierce than to your own efforts. His labors have been a special blessing to that state. He is a man of tender conscience. The fear of God is before him. Infirmities have weighed heavily upon him, and this has led him to question whether he was in the way of his duty and to fear that God was not favoring his efforts. God loves Brother Pierce. He has but little self-esteem, and he fears and doubts and dreads labor; for the thought is constantly upon his mind \n                                                                           630\nthat he is not worthy or capable to help others. If he would overcome timidity and possess more confidence that God would be with him and strengthen him he would be much more happy and a greater blessing to others. In the life of Brother Pierce there has been a failure to read character. He believed others to be as honest as himself, and in some cases he has been deceived. He has not the discernment that some have. You also have failed, in your life, to read character. You have spoken peace to those against whom God has declared evil. In his age and feebleness Brother Pierce may be imposed upon, yet all should esteem him highly for his work's sake. He commands the love and tenderest sympathy of his brethren, for he is a conscientious, God-fearing man.",
