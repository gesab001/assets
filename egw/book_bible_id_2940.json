{"word": "Then, children, come to Jesus. Give to God the most precious offering that it is possible for you to make; give Him your heart. He speaks to you saying, \\93My son, My daughter, give Me thine heart. Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow; for I will cleanse you with My own blood. I will make you members of My family\\97children of the heavenly King. Take My forgiveness, My peace which I freely give you. I will clothe you with My own righteousness,\\97the wedding garment,\\97and make you fit for the marriage supper of the Lamb. When clothed in My righteousness, through prayer, through watchfulness, through diligent study of My word, you will be able to reach a high standard. You will understand the truth, and your character will be moulded by a divine influence; for this is the will of God, even your sanctification.\\94(The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, 1162.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 241}
