{"word": "Jesus has not left you to be surprised and amazed at the trials and difficulties you meet. He has told you all about them, and He has also told you that you should not be cast down and oppressed when trials come. You are to look to Jesus, your Redeemer, and be cheerful and rejoice. . . . We have a living Saviour, who so loved us that He died for us, that through Him we might have hope, strength, and courage, and a seat with Him upon His throne.--Letter 8, July 16, 1886, to Dr. J. H. Kellogg, director of Battle Creek Sanitarium.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 211}
