{"word": "Sanitariums and Hygienic Restaurants \n\n     God has declared that sanitariums and hygienic restaurants should be established for the purpose of making known to the world His law. The closing of our restaurants on the Sabbath is to be a witness that there is a people who will not for worldly gain, or to please people, disregard God's holy rest day. These restaurants are to be established in our cities to bring the truth before many who are engrossed in the business and pleasure of this world. Many of these are professed Christians, but are \"lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.\" These are to know that God has a people who fear Him and keep His commandments. They are to be taught how to choose and prepare the simple food that is best suited to nourish the body and preserve the health.--MS. 115, 1903.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 306}
