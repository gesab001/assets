{"word": "BUT THE THRONE OF GOD WILL BE CLEAR, AND SINNERS WILL BE WITHOUT EXCUSE; FOR THE WARNINGS OF THE SCRIPTURES ARE GIVEN IN NO UNCERTAIN LANGUAGE. TO THE IMPIOUS THE LORD SAYS: \"BECAUSE I HAVE CALLED, AND YE REFUSED; I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HAND, AND NO MAN REGARDED; BUT YE HAVE SET AT NAUGHT ALL MY COUNSEL, AND WOULD NONE OF MY REPROOF: I ALSO WILL LAUGH AT YOUR CALAMITY; I WILL MOCK WHEN YOUR FEAR COMETH; WHEN YOUR FEAR COMETH AS DESOLATION, AND YOUR DESTRUCTION COMETH AS A WHIRL- WIND; WHEN DISTRESS AND ANGUISH COMETH UPON YOU. THEN SHALL THEY CALL UPON ME, BUT I WILL NOT ANSWER; THEY SHALL SEEK ME EARLY, BUT THEY SHALL NOT FIND ME.\" PROVERBS 1:24-28. AND THE WARNING OF THE LAST MESSAGE IS GOING TO ALL THE WORLD. IT ALSO IS CLEAR AND DECISIVE IN ITS UTTERANCE. \"THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD,\" WHICH IT ENFORCES, ARE NOT OBSCURE OR HARD TO BE UNDERSTOOD. THE FOURTH SAYS, \"THE SEVENTH DAY IS THE SABBATH OF THE LORD THY GOD.\" THIS WAS THE LORD'S DAY--HIS HOLY DAY--FROM THE CREATION OF THE WORLD. HE CLAIMS NO OTHER AS HIS; HE SANCTIFIED NO OTHER; HE NEVER COMMANDED ANY OTHER TO BE OBSERVED. THEY WHO TURN AWAY FROM A TRUTH SO PLAIN, WHO REJECT A WARNING SO SOLEMN, WILL HAVE NO ANSWER TO MAKE WHEN THE LORD COMMANDS THEM TO DEPART.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 501}
