{"word": "There is need of every one in every school and in every other institution being as was Daniel, in such close connection with the Source of all wisdom that he will be enabled to reach the highest standard in every line. The love and fear of God was before Daniel; and conscious of his amenability to God, he trained all his powers to respond as far as possible to the loving care of the great Teacher.

This is no higher standard than every Christian youth may reach.--\"Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students,\" pp. 281-284.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 372}
