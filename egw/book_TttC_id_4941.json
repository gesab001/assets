    "word": "Brother E, what use are you making of the talents God has placed in your care? Have you done what you could to enlighten the minds of men in regard to truth, or have you found no time from your business cares and perplexities to devote to this work? It is a crime to use the bounties of God as you have done, to diminish your physical strength and separate your affections from God. \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\" You cannot love this world and love the truth of God. \"Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\" \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\" You are not a happy man. Your family is not a happy family. Angels of God do not come in and abide with you. When the religion of Christ rules in the heart, conscience approves, and peace and happiness reign; perplexity and trouble may surround, yet there is light in the soul.",
