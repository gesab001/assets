{"word": "God will communicate by His own Spirit with the soul. Pray as you study, \"Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law,\" Psalm 119:18. When the teacher will rely upon God in prayer, the Spirit of Christ will come upon him, and God will work through him by the Holy Spirit upon the mind of the student. The Holy Spirit fills mind and heart with hope and courage and Bible imagery, which will be communicated to the student. The words of truth will grow in importance, and will assume a breadth and fullness of meaning of which he has never dreamed. The beauty and virtue of the word of God have a transforming influence upon mind and character; the sparks of heavenly love will fall upon the hearts of the children as an inspiration. We may bring hundreds and thousands of children to Christ if we will work for them.  CT 171, 172332", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 205}
