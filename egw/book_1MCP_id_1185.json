{"word": "The talent of time is precious. Every day it is given to us in trust, and we shall be called upon to give an account of it to God. It is to be used to God's glory, and if we would prolong our lives, if we would gain the life that measures with the life of God, we must give the mind pure food. No time should be wasted that might have been used to good account.--MS 15, 1898.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 358}
