    "word": "The words of the angel, \u201cI am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God,\u201d show that he holds a position of high honor in the heavenly courts. When he came with a message to Daniel, he said, \u201cThere is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your Prince.\u201d Daniel 10:21. Of Gabriel the Saviour speaks in\n153\nthe Revelation, saying that \u201cHe sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John.\u201d Revelation 1:1. And to John the angel declared, \u201cI am a fellow servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets.\u201d Revelation 22:9, R.V. Wonderful thought\u2014that the angel who stands next in honor to the Son of God is the one chosen to open the purposes of God to sinful men.\u2014DA 97-99.",
