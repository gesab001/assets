    "word": "As I have labored to impress upon females the necessity of walking, some have received my ideas, and determined to carry them out at once. And [at] the first effort they walked perhaps half a mile, became exhausted and really suffered so much that they decided that walking was not best for them. These went to an extreme. They could not bear so much walking at first without injury. Some are ever disposed to go to extremes. They can never come up to the mark, and then be content to stop. They go beyond. They fail to make the best use of the reason Heaven has granted them.--HR, July 1, 1868.",
