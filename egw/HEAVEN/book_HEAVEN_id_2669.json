    "word": "The One Perfect Pattern \n\n     To bring man back into harmony with God, so to elevate and ennoble his moral nature that he may again reflect the image of the Creator, is the great purpose of all the education and discipline of life. So important was this work that the Saviour left the courts of heaven and came in person to this earth, that He might teach men how to obtain a fitness for the higher life. For thirty years He dwelt as a man among men, passed through the experiences of human life as a child, a youth, a man; He \n                                                                           50\nendured the severest trials that He might present a living illustration of the truths He taught. For three years as a teacher sent from God He instructed the children of men; then, leaving the work to chosen colaborers, He ascended to heaven. But His interest in it has not abated. From the courts above He watches with the deepest solicitude the progress of the cause for which He gave His life.",
