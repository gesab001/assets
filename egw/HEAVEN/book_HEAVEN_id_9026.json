    "word": "To all Christ has given the work of ministry. He is the King of glory, yet He declared, \"The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\" He is the Majesty of heaven, yet He willingly consented to come to this earth to do the work laid upon Him by His Father. He has ennobled labor. That He might set us an example of industry, He worked with His hands at the carpenter's trade. From a very early age He acted His part in sustaining the family. He realized that He was a part of the family firm, and willingly bore His share of the burdens.",
