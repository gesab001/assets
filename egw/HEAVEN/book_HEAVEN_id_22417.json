    "word": "When the converting power of God takes hold of the teachers in our schools, they will consider that a knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ covers a much broader field than the so-called scholastic education does. But unless they have a much broader view in regard to what constitutes education, they will experience great hindrance in preparing missionaries to go out and give their knowledge to others. In all our education, we should remember the words of Christ, \"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.\" (Matthew 5:14.) Of ourselves we cannot shine, but if the Word of God abides in our souls, we will shine, for nothing can eclipse the light of heaven or retard the truth.",
