    "word": "MR No. 1461 - The Necessity of Studying the Word\n\n     The Lord has given to the world a message of wonderful mercy. God has sent to men the light of heaven, but they have rejected the truth, and followed in the path of the Pharisees of Christ's day. In the world today the rejection of the mercies, the warnings, and invitations of Christ has been repeated. The great salvation offered to humanity in these last days in the \"bright and morning Star,\" has not been received. His counsels have been despised. His temple courts have been converted into desecrated shrines, places of unholy traffic. Unrighteousness, selfishness, the love of gain, envy, pride, passion, and malice, have been entertained. Men have blinded their eyes, and stumbled along in darkness, living on in guilty unconsciousness of their aggravating sins, and turning God's agents from their rights. They have despised reproof and warnings; they have treated the ambassadors of God with scorn and His messages as idle tales. In their stubbornness they have refused to humble their hearts and repent.",
