    "word": "After Christ was received up into heaven and set at the right hand of his Father, his disciples went forth and preached the Word, and the record states that the Lord worked with them, confirming the word with signs following. Today the Lord is qualifying his servants to take up medical missionary work. He calls for men and women who are peaceable in spirit, who learn of Jesus, and are willing to follow his instruction, who day by day wait upon the Lord to know his will, prepared to go where he bids them go, and to take up the work which he requires.",
