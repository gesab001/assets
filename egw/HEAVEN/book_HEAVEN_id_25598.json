D. Van Horn Charlotte, Michigan Dear Brother, \n     My silence may be misinterpreted by you to think I do not accept your letter of confession; but dear brother, this is not the case. I do accept your letter fully, and am very, very thankful your eyes have been anointed with the heavenly eye-salve that you may see clearly, and give to the flock of God meat in due season, which they so much need.",
