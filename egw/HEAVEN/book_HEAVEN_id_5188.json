    "word": "Consistency in the Christian Life\n     We have every evidence that Jesus is waiting to bless us. It is not his will that we should go forth to labor in his cause, and yet have no special help, no power from on high, to attend our labors. God has never bidden us hold up the standard of his law in these days of general apostasy, without the aid of divine power. We may have help from heaven, and we should not feel free to go to battle without the evidence that God's presence will attend us.",
