    "word": "We are not to do a particle less than it is in our power to do to advance Christ's kingdom. We are to labor in the spirit and manner in which He labored. He holds every man responsible for working in the right way. Only those who labor for the Master in a Christlike spirit and manner, because of their love for Him and their desire to please Him; only those who refuse to take to themselves any praise and glory will receive the approbation of Heaven--Ms 128, 1903. \n\nEllen G.
