    "word": "Mr. Lamont is the father of two very fine men, who think much of their parents, especially of the mother. They are in business for themselves. One has a family. Recently one of the sons sat at their table, and took dinner with them. The father humbly and reverentially asked a blessing. The son said to his mother, \"What a change has come over Father! He never did such a thing as this before.\" The father made answer, \"Your mother is a Christian. She is going to heaven, and I cannot be separated from your mother. I am trying to be a Christian and go to heaven with her; and we hope our sons will also become Christians and meet us there.\"",
