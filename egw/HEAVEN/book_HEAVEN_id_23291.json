    "word": "John's attention was called to another scene: \"And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God\" (Revelation 7:2). Who is this? The Angel of the covenant. He comes from the sunrising. He is the Dayspring from on high. He is the Light of the world. \"In Him was life; and the life was the light of men\" (John 1:4). This is the One Isaiah describes: \"Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, \n\n\n                                  -222- \n\nCounselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace\" (Isaiah 9:6). He cried, as One who had superiority over the hosts of angels in heaven \"to whom it was given to hurt the earth, and the sea, saying, \"hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads\" (Revelation 7:2, 3).",
