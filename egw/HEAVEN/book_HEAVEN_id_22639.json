    "word": "MR No. 807 - The Vision of Moses\n\n     After Moses had given final instructions and lessons to the children of Israel he ascended Mount Nebo. From Pisgah's summit was revealed to him in panoramic view the land that he was not allowed to enter. Angels of God pointed out every part of the land as it was spread out before his vision. They told him of the fertility of the soil and that it was well watered. He saw the grain fields and the fruit-laden trees just as they appeared in the Promised Land. The whole land, in all its richness and beauty, was spread out before him, and he saw that it was a goodly land. The heavenly angels told him that from the beginning to the end of the year God's watchful care was over the land.",
