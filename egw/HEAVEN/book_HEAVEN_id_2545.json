Let us bring them to Jesus. Let us use our treasures for the advancement of His cause. Thus we shall obey the injunction, \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\"--R. & H., April 9, 1901.",
