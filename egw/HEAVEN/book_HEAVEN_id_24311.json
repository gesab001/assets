    "word": "To do unto others as we would they should do to us, this rule we must follow or we are none of Christ's. My brother, study the words spoken by Christ from the Mount of Blessing: \"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 5:3). The poor in spirit are the ones whom Christ loves. They are humble; they feel their dependence upon the Lord for all temporal and spiritual blessings. They do not trust in themselves, but depend on their Redeemer, the Alpha and Omega.",
