    "word": "Well would it be for young and old to study and ponder and often repeat those words of Holy Writ that show how the place marked by God's special presence should be regarded. \"Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,\" He commanded Moses at the burning bush; \"for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground\" (Exodus 3:5). Jacob, after beholding the vision of the angels, exclaimed, \"The Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. . . . This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven\" (Genesis 28:16, 17). \"The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him\" (Habakkuk 2:20). \n\n\n     \"The Lord is a great God, \n      And a great King above all gods. . . . \n      O come, let us worship and bow down: \n      Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\" \n     \"It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; \n      We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. \n      Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, \n      And into his courts with praise: \n      Be thankful unto him, and bless his name.\" \n         (Psalm 95:3-6; 100:3, 4).",
