    "word": "\"Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. . . . Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word\" (Psalm 148:3-8). All these agencies of God in nature are summoned to bring their tribute of praise to the Most High. And who among God's creatures will be silent when every star as it traverses its course, every breeze as it sweeps the earth, and every cloud that darkens the firmament, every shower of rain and every ray of sunshine--all are showing forth the praise of God who reigneth in the heavens?--Manuscript 9, June 20, 1884, \"Visit to Multnomah Falls.\"",
