    "word": "En route to California, September 16, 1889--We have excellent accommodations. There are but two parties besides ourselves in the car, and we have plenty of room. I am so weary I must keep my berth made, for it seems as though it would be very difficult to sit up. I usually do some knitting, but I have no strength even for this. I am asking my heavenly Father for the strength required that I may do His will. I have a message to bear to the people, and although struggling against infirmities I am not comfortless. I have the blessed assurance. \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" The peace of Christ is of highest value.",
