    "word": "God desires us to shine as lights in the world. Darkness has covered the earth, and gross darkness the people; and Christ says to His followers, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" We are to give the light of truth to others, ever asking, ever receiving, ever imparting, working in all simplicity through the sanctification of the Spirit.",
