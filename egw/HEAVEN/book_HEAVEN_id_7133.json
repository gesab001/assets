    "word": "\u201cWhile visiting my sisters in Poland, I was afflicted with sickness. Those present united in \n224\nprayer in my behalf, and the disease was rebuked. Angels seemed to be in the room, and all was light and glory. I was again taken off in vision, and shown that I must go about three miles to a meeting, and when there should learn what the Lord would have me do. We went, and found quite a large gathering of the brethren and sisters. None had known of any special meeting. J.T. was there. He had boasted that he understood the art of mesmerism, and that he could mesmerize me; that he could prevent me from having a vision or relating a vision in his presence. There were many present who had heard this boast. I arose in the congregation. My visions came up fresh before me, and I commenced relating them, when I felt a human influence being exerted against me. I looked at J.T. He had his hand up to his face, and was looking through his fingers, his eyes intently fixed upon me. His lips were compressed, and a low groan now and then escaped him. In a moment I remembered the promise which the Lord had given me, that if I was in danger of being affected by a human influence, and would ask for another angel, one would be sent to protect me. I then turned to this man, and related what the Lord had shown me in Portland; and, raising my hands to heaven, earnestly cried, \u2018Another angel, Father! another angel!\u2019 I knew that my request was granted. I felt shielded by the strong Spirit of the Lord, and was borne above every earthly influence, and with freedom finished my testimony. The friends were comforted, and rejoiced in the Lord. J.T. was asked why he had not stopped my relating the vision. He answered, \u2018Oh, some of you would have her talk.\u2019 We returned to my sister's with strong confidence, rejoicing in God.",
