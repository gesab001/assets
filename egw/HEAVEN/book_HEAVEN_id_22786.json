    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has been beguiled by beautiful, philosophical theories that are contrary to the truth. He is standing as a guide and instructor of youth. But for a long time he has been presented to me as a man walking in strange paths. He has not been working with the Lord. If his blind eyes could be anointed with the heavenly eyesalve, and he would then look at himself in the moral looking glass, he would see his sad condition and understand that unless he breaks his heart before God, and makes an entire reformation, he will surely receive of the judgments of God. The Lord will not forever bear with his perversity.",
