    "word": "Having undertaken the work of man's redemption, the Father would spare nothing, however dear, which was essential for the completion of His work.

Having collected all the riches of the universe, and laid open all the resources of His divine nature, God gave them all for the use of man. They were His free gift. What an ocean of love is circulating, like a divine atmosphere, around the world! What manner of love is this, that the eternal God should adopt human nature in the person of His Son, and carry the same into the highest heaven!",
