    "word": "When we submit to the solemn rite of baptism, we testify to angels and to men that we are purged from our old sins, and that henceforth, having died to the world, we will \"seek those things which are above. . . .\" (Colossians 3:1). Let us not forget our baptismal vow. In the presence of the three highest powers of heaven--the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit--we have pledged ourselves to do the will of Him who . . . declared, \"I am the resurrection, and the life.: John 11:25. Christ forgives every penitent sinner, and as the forgiven one, at the time of baptism, rises from the watery grave, he is declared a new creature, whose life is hid with Christ in God. Let us ever remember that it is our high privilege to be purged from our old sins.",
