    "word": "But there are presented to me dangers and quicksands that must be carefully avoided. While those who are obeying the word in Isaiah, \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins,\" in this work so essential to be done, things will be encouraged that will result in marring the work of God, unless the messengers are endowed with heavenly wisdom. We must act like men in earnest. We need to obtain a rich daily experience in prayer; we should be like the importunate widow, who, in her conscious need, overcame the unjust judge by the bare force of her determined pleading. God will be enquired of to do these things for us; for this is giving depth and solidity to our experience. The soul that seeks God will need to be in earnest. He is a rewarder of all those that seek him diligently.",
