    "word": "MR No. 651 - Our Church Paper\n\n     To all interested managers in our General Conference: I wish you to understand that I am every day grateful to our heavenly Father that our printing plant is to send forth the church paper from Takoma Park to all parts of our world, and more than this I am instructed to say that its circulation should be greatly increased. It is circulated in all places in a limited way. The Lord would have this paper come to many more families, in England, yes, in many places. It should go to Australia, where there are located large numbers of English-speaking people. And everything should be carefully written that light shall shine forth as a lamp that burneth. Much more should be written upon actual experiences and much more given in short articles, right to the point, on Bible present truth. The reasons why we are denominated people of God are to be repeated and repeated. Deuteronomy 4:1-13;  5:1-33.--Ms 175, 1905. (Diary, July 10, 1905.) \n\nReleased October 26, 1978.",
