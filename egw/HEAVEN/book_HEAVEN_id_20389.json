    "word": "And now I appreciate the Christian's hope, and the Christian's Heaven, and the Christian's Saviour, as I have never appreciated them before. And today I can say, \"There is rest for the weary.\" When we were looking, but a short time ago, to Colorado, and to the Atlantic coast, and to the Pacific, for rest, my husband said, \"Let us not be over-anxious. We know not what a day may bring forth. God may open up a way before us that now seems indistinct and cloudy. But,\" said he, \"I shall have rest, I shall have rest. All our ways are hid in Jesus Christ, and he will open up the way before us if we only trust him from day to day. Let us now trust in him.\" And there [turning toward the coffin] my husband has found rest; but I have yet to battle. I cannot yet lay off the armor of the Lord. When I fall, let me fall at my post of duty; let me be ready; let me be where I can say as he said, \"All is well. Jesus is precious.\"",
