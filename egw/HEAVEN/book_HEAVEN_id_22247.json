    "word": "As God's commandment-keeping people we have a most sacred work to do in making clear, simple, and plain the spiritual basis of our faith. All need to become familiar with the requirements of God for this time. Influences of various kinds and orders will come in to sway the people of God from the saving tests for this time. But there will be brought in a vast amount of man-made tests that have not the least bearing upon the work given us of God \n\n\n                                    -92- \n\nto prepare a people to stand with the whole equipment of the heavenly armor on, without leaving off one piece. The word of God and His down-trodden law are to be made prominent in so marked a manner that men and women, members of other churches, shall be brought face to face, mind to mind, heart to heart with truth. They will see its superiority over the multitudinous errors that are presented and are pushing their way into notice, to supplement if possible the truth for this solemn time. Every soul is taking sides. All are ranging themselves either under the banner of truth and righteousness or under the banner of the apostate powers that are contending for the supremacy.--Letter 121, 1900, pp. 3, 4. (To Brother and Sister Haskell, August 13, 1900.) \n\nReleased May 23, 1975.",
