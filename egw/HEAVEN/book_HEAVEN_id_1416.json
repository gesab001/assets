    "word": "Counsel to a General Conference President--Elder Olsen, of necessity you have many burdens to bear; but do not gather burdens, and become crushed under them.  The Lord does not mean to press weights on any one to crush out his life, and forever stop his bearing any burdens.  Our loving heavenly Father says to every one of His workers, \"Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and He shall sustain thee.\" Again comes the injunction, \"Casting all your care upon Him; for He careth for you.\"",
