    "word": "When God commanded the tabernacle to be built in the wilderness, each man's work was assigned him. If he left his work to engage in some other \n                                                                           1148\nman's work, death was the penalty. In setting up and taking down the tabernacle, in moving from place to place in the wilderness, the position each was to occupy was plainly specified. Christ was the invisible General of that company of more than a million people, and there were no haphazard, disorderly movements made. Order, dispatch, and exactitude were required of each one, at the post of duty assigned him. This is an important lesson to the church, and to every man whom God has chosen to act a part in His great work. No one is required to do another's work. Each is to do the work assigned him with exactness and integrity. The management of that great church in their journeyings in the wilderness symbolizes the management of the church till the close of earth's history, till we come into possession of the heavenly Canaan.",
