    "word": "The time has come when whatever I may write in private letters to some of our brethren will do little good; for those who have not held the beginning of their confidence firm unto the end will be liable to interpret my communications in a false way. To have ministers and physicians who have long known the truth using my writings in a way that gives the impression that these writings uphold the very sentiments that are condemned by the testimonies I have received from God, places a very heavy burden on my soul. These men place such an interpretation on extracts which they take from my writings, that the reproofs given by God are made of no effect. The Lord God of heaven declares, \"If they repent, I will pardon their transgressions; but if they do not repent, I will call them to account for that which they have misinterpreted in order to serve theories that are not true. By their course, souls have been led astray, and when I cease my forbearance, because they will not repent, I will punish them for all the evil \n\n\n                                      -45- \n\nthey have done by mingling false sentiments with the true. They have departed from the faith themselves, and have led others astray.\"",
