    "word": "He whose life consists in ever receiving and never giving soon loses the blessing. If truth does not flow forth from him to others, he loses his capacity to receive. We must impart the goods of heaven if we would have fresh blessings. . . . If men will become channels through which God's blessing can flow to others, the Lord will keep the channel supplied.--Manuscript 139, Oct. 21, 1898, \"An Appeal for Missions.\"",
