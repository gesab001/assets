    "word": "He who is meek in spirit, who is purest and most childlike, will be made strong for the battle. He will be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man. He who feels His weakness, and wrestles with God as did Jacob, and like this servant of old cries, \"I will not let thee go except Thou bless me,\" will go forth with the fresh anointing of the Holy Spirit. The atmosphere of heaven will surround him. His influence will be a positive force in favor of the religion of Christ.",
