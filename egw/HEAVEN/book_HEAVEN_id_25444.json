    "word": "The Lord has been prodigal of His means to save man. Boundless are His resources. Heavenly intelligences are ready to unite with human agencies and men may come into immediate contact with Jesus Christ, the divine Advocate. When men feel that Jesus Christ must have entire control of the whole heart, of all the affections, then He will be with every worker, carrying the heavy end of the yoke. He moves upon human hearts by His Holy Spirit. We have a work to do to go into all the world with the light God has given, asserting with pen and voice the rights of God and vindicating the claims of God. Jesus is to be our only trust and confidence. His righteousness is to be our assurance forever.",
