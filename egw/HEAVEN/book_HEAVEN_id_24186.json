    "word": "It is your duty, poor, afflicted soul, to come to the great Healer. He is as much afflicted by your afflictions today as when He was upon the earth. He sympathized with all human woe. \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,\" He says. Then come to your Saviour who can heal all your sicknesses and all your diseases. He conquered death. He is the risen Saviour, the Lord of life. Will you come just as you are, and pray in faith to be healed of all manner of diseases, of all maladies which afflict the soul and the body? Center your faith so \n\n\n\n\n                                     -25- \n\ndeeply and securely in Jesus Christ that no circumstance of any kind will jostle your faith. Let your life be hid with Christ in God.",
