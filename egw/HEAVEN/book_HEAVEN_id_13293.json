    "word": "In his teaching, Christ sought to educate and train the Jews to see the object of that which was to be abolished by the true offering of himself, the living sacrifice. \"Go,\" said he, \"and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice.\" He presented a pure character as of supreme importance. He dispensed with all pomp, demanding that faith that works by love and purifies the soul, as the only qualification required for the kingdom of heaven. He taught that true religion does not consist in forms or ceremonies, outward attractions or outward display. Christ would have taken these to himself if they had been essential in the formation of a character after the divine similitude. But his citizenship, his divine authority, rested upon his own intrinsic merits. He, the Majesty of heaven, walked the earth, shrouded in the robe of humanity. All his attractions and triumphs were to be revealed in behalf of man, and were to testify to his living connection with God.",
