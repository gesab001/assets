    "word": "I call your attention to the sure results of heeding the Lord's admonition to care for the afflicted: \"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily.\" Is not this what \n                                                                           303\nwe all crave? Oh, there is health and peace in doing the will of our Heavenly Father. \"Thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shalt be thy rereward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day: and the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\"--Medical Missionary, June, 1891.",
