    "word": "If believers fall in love with the truth in its purity, if they become free from all worldliness and self-exaltation, if they are all agreed, the influence of their lives will make an impression on unbelievers. Their reward may not always come in this life, but even in this world they will possess a peace and quietude, a rest in God, that passeth all understanding. Many will take knowledge of them, that they have been with Jesus and have learned of Him. In the future will come their exceeding great reward. In the heavenly courts they will hear the words, \"Well (572) done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" In their purity, their humility, and their meekness, they have represented Christ, and they are now entering into their eternal riches. They are washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. The joy of Christ is their exceeding great reward.",
