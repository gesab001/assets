    "word": "283\n \n \n     Jesus prayed principally for others.--Christ was continually receiving from the Father, that He might communicate to us. \"The word which ye hear,\" He said, \"is not Mine, but the Father's which sent Me.\" \"The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\" Not for Himself, but for others, He lived and thought and prayed. From hours spent with God He came forth morning by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. Daily He received a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit. In the early hours of the new day the Lord awakened Him from His slumbers, and His soul and His lips were anointed with grace, that He might impart to others.--RH Aug. 11, 1910.",
