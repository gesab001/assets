    "word": "But in the scenes presented me, I saw men talking together between the meetings about the mistakes and faults of their brethren. In the place of searching their own hearts, and praying, and confessing their own mistakes, men seemed to be anxious that others should feel that they had acted unwisely. \n                                                                           26\nAngels from heaven, sent to minister wisdom and grace, were disappointed to see self pressing its way in, to make things appear in a wrong light. Men were talking and accusing, and conjectures were brought in that should have had no place in the meeting.",
