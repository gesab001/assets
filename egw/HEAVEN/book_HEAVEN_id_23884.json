    "word": "For years appeals have been made to men in responsible positions, urging upon them the necessity of being kind, tenderhearted, and always to deal in a Christlike manner with those with whom they come in contact. Said Christ, \"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth Me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in Me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!\" [Matthew 18:4-7].",
