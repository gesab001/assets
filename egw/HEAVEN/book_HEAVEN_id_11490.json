    "word": "The language of the meek is never that of boasting. Like the child Samuel, they pray, \"Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth\" (1 Samuel 3:9). When Joshua was placed in the highest position of honor, as commander of Israel, he bade defiance to all the enemies of God. His heart was filled with noble thoughts of his great mission. Yet upon the intimation of a message from Heaven he placed himself in the position of a little child to be directed. \"What saith my lord unto his servant?\" (Joshua 5:14), was his response. The first words of Paul after Christ was revealed to him were, \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\" (Acts 9:6).",
