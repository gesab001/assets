    "word": "We are living amidst the perils of the last days. We are able to watch unto prayer. We are to put our entire trust in God, glorifying Him. Daily we are to learn lessons from the greatest medical missionary that ever trod this earth. He is our tabernacle of witness for heavenly things. He will not accept that which has been done in bringing so much of a commercial spirit into the medical missionary work, neither will He accept the Laodicean condition of the medical missionary association. This association is not doing the work indicated by its name. It is not preparing a people to obtain a sound, healthy experience, which will stand the test of the judgment. I am so sorry; for God is dishonored. His work, which should be a praise in the earth, is belittled. False sentiments have been entertained, and a strange work has been done.",
