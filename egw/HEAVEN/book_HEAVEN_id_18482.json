    "word": "The loyal angels hasten speedily to the Son of God and acquaint Him with what is taking place among the angels. They find the Father in conference with His beloved Son, to determine the means by which, for the best good of the loyal angels, the assumed authority of Satan could be forever put down. The great God could at once have hurled this arch deceiver from heaven;\n42\nbut this was not His purpose.

In this battle every angel would choose his own side, and be manifested to all.\u20141SP 21.",
