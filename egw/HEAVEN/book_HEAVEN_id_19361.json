    "word": "This was the experience of the early disciples. The Scriptures declare that \"when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance\" (Acts 2:1-4). God is willing to give us a similar blessing, when we seek for it as earnestly.",
