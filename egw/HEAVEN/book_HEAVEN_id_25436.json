    "word": "God was grieved with the ingratitude of His chosen people. When Samuel prayed to the Lord in the grief of his soul, the Lord told him it was not the man Samuel they were dissatisfied with, but with the Lord's divine authority, for He as a King over His people, appointed their judges. If the judges became untrue, if they became unsanctified, if they trusted to their own finite wisdom, it was the place of the people to set these things in order, and not to throw off the authority of the God of heaven. This was a continuation of the rebellion which left the dead bodies of their fathers in the wilderness.",
