    "word": "The articles published in our papers should contain pure provender, thoroughly winnowed from chaff. We are living in a most solemn time.

It will be food for those who are laboring in isolated places, in foreign countries and the islands of the sea, to hear in this way from their friends with whom they have been associated. These experiences may be to the readers as a love feast, because the writers have been eating the bread which came down from heaven.",
