    "word": "MR No. 641 - No Respecter of Persons with God\n\n     The Lord God of heaven would have the entire church devising ways and means whereby high and low, rich and poor, may hear the message of truth. The Lord Jesus, the mighty Saviour, has died for these souls. He can arouse them from their indifference; He can awaken their sympathies; He can soften their hearts; He can reveal to their souls the beauty and power of the truth. The master worker is God, and not finite man, and yet, He calls upon men to be the agents through whom He can impart light to those in darkness. God has jewels in all the churches, and it is not for us to make sweeping denunciations of the professed religious world, but in humility and love, to present to all the truth as it is in Jesus. Let men see piety and devotion. Let them behold Christlikeness of character, and they will be drawn to the truth. He who loves God supremely and his neighbor as himself, will be a light in the world. Those who have a knowledge of the truth are to communicate the same; they are to lift up Jesus, the world's redeemer; they are to hold forth the word of life.--Ms 152, 1897, pp. 1, 2. (\"The Church Must Be Quickened,\" 1897.)",
