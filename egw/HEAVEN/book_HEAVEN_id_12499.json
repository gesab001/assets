    "word": "How amazed is heaven at the present condition of the church that could be so much to the world if every stone were in its proper place, a living stone to emit light! A stone that does not shine is worthless. That which constitutes the value of our churches is not dead, lusterless stones, but living stones, stones that catch the bright beams from the Chief Cornerstone, even the Sun of Righteousness--the bright glory in which are combined the beams of mercy and truth that have met together, of righteousness and peace that have kissed each other (Letter 15, 1892).",
