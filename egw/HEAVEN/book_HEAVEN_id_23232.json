    "word": "Man proposes, but in order to save him from utter ruin, God disposes. God protests against the greed of the natural heart for gold. Whenever His way is \n\n\n                                   -71- \n\ndeparted from and His will violated, by nations, churches, institutions, or individuals, it is recorded in the books of heaven, and retribution will surely follow. \"He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase\" [Ecclesiastes 5:10]. He who says to gold, \"Thou art my confidence\" [Job 31:24], will find himself \"pierced through with many sorrows\" [1 Timothy 6:10]. God would have His people keep themselves from all speculations.--Manuscript 26, Diary entry, January 7, 1890.",
