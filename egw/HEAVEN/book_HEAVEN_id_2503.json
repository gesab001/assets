    "word": "Reprimand, Accusation, Fretting, Useless \n\n\n     It will do no good to reprimand, and accuse, and fret at your scholars when they manifest a spirit of unrest and mischievousness. Remember you are to be a patient laborer together with God, and that all heaven is interested in the work you are doing, and any part in the work of God means toil and travail of soul. \"Quit you like men, be strong.\" Ask of your Master, who submitted to humiliation, and who endured the death of the cross, what He would have you to do. Take all your entrusted talents with you into the work, and put them out to the exchangers. Through the grace of Christ you will be able to do a precious work for the Master. The wealth of divine resources is at your command, and through prayer \n                                                                           181\nand faith you may lay hold on the promises of God, and appropriate them to your need.",
