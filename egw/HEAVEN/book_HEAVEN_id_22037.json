    "word": "We want heaven and its joy. We want to put away sin, and it is our privilege to ask, \"What is sin?\" The Bible gives the definition: \"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of \n\n\n                                    -261- \n\nthe law\" [1 John 3:4]. The law of God is the rule of our life, and by it our characters will be measured. It is the work of Satan to keep you from forming a right character that will meet the perfect standard. I desire that you should have a heaven of bliss, and the great gift will be bestowed on those that obey. Our precious Saviour has provided everything for us, and we should remember Jesus and follow Him.",
