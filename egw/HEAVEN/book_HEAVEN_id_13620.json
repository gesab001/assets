    "word": "Jesus laid the burden of decision upon them as to the true character of John's mission. \"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say from Heaven, he will say, Why believed ye him not? But and if we say, Of men, all the people will stone us; for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.\" In their hearts they did not accept the teachings of John. If they had done so they could not have rejected Jesus, of whom John prophesied. But they had deceived the people by assuming to believe in the ministry of John; and now they dared not, in answer to the Saviour's question, declare that John's mission was divine lest Jesus should demand their reason for not receiving the prophet's testimony concerning him. He might have said, If John was from Heaven, so am I; my ministry and work is so \n                                                                           30\nclosely connected with his that they cannot be separated.",
