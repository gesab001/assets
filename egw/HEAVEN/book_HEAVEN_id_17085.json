    "word": "Our only safety will be found in constantly seeking wisdom from God, in carefully weighing every matter with much fear and trembling, lest there should be brought into the work not the light of heaven, but the weakness of man. But the Lord has promised to give light to those who seek Him with the whole heart. If we will but wait patiently and prayerfully upon God, and not follow our own impetuous plans, He will guide our decisions and open many doors of hope and labor.",
