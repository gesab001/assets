    "word": "Here are mysteries that the mind will become strong in searching out. . . . All may find themes for study in . . . the spires of grass covering the earth with their green velvet carpet, the plants and flowers, . . . the lofty mountains, the granite rocks, . . . the precious gems of light studding the heavens to make the night beautiful, the exhaustless riches of the sunlight, the solemn glories of the moon, the winter's cold, the summer's heat, the changing, recurring seasons, in perfect order and harmony, controlled by infinite power; here are subjects which call for deep thought, for the stretch of the imagination. \n                                                                           113",
