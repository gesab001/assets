    "word": "Thus are we to treat the erring, wandering one. We should be ready to sacrifice our own ease and comfort when a soul for whom Christ died is in peril. Said Jesus, \"Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.\" As joy was manifested at the recovery of the one lost sheep, so will exceeding joy and gratitude be manifested by the true servants of Christ when one soul is saved from death.--Manuscript 1, 1878.",
