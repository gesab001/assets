    "word": "What Constitutes a Christian. \n\n     A pure religion, an upright, holy life, constitutes a man a Christian. But ever since his defection in heaven, Satan's course has been one of perpetual deception and harshness; and there are professed Christians who are learning his methods and practises. While they claim to be serving the cause of God, they turn their fellow men from their rights, in order to serve themselves.",
