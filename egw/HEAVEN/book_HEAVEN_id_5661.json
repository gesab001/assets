    "word": "The heirs of God have come from garrets, from hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds, from mountains, from deserts, from the caves of the earth, from the caverns of the sea. On earth they were \u201cdestitute, afflicted, tormented.\u201d Millions went down to the grave loaded with infamy, because they steadfastly refused to yield to the deceptive claims of Satan. By human tribunals they were adjudged the vilest of criminals. But now \u201cGod is judge himself.\u201d [Psalm 50:6.] Now the decisions of earth are reversed. \u201cThe rebuke of his people shall he take away.\u201d [Isaiah 25:8.] \u201cThey shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord.\u201d He hath appointed \u201cto give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\u201d [Isaiah 62:12; 61:3.] They are no longer feeble, afflicted, scattered, and oppressed. Henceforth they are to be ever with the Lord. They stand before the throne clad in richer robes than the most honored of the earth have ever worn. They are crowned with diadems more glorious than were ever placed upon the brow of earthly monarchs. The days of pain and weeping are forever ended. The King of glory has wiped the tears from all faces; every cause of grief has been removed. Amid the waving of palm-branches they pour forth a song of praise, clear, sweet, and harmonious; every voice takes up \n651\nthe strain, until the anthem swells through the vaults of Heaven, \u201cSalvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.\u201d And all the inhabitants of Heaven respond in the ascription, \u201cAmen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God forever and ever.\u201d [Revelation 7:10, 12.]",
