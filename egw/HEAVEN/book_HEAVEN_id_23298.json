    "word": "God does not ask sinners to enter His service with their natural traits of character, to make a failure before the heavenly universe and before the world. He does not ask a man who is unconverted to attempt to serve Him. Those who have not been brought under the control of the law of justice and mercy might better step down from their position of authority until they learn that the Lord will have mercy and not sacrifice.",
