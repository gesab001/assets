    "word": "So many have not the real faith that works by love and purifies the soul; therefore they choose to labor for the approbation of men rather than of God. No real heavenly brightness is brought into their religious life, and the future is devoid of the assurance which leads them to trust and hope. Many are living in transgression and rebellion against God. They choose to indulge their carnal impulses rather than to yoke up with Christ, lift the cross, and follow Jesus. There is a cross to lift, and self-denial to practise, in all the ways of practical godliness. It is through care and helpfulness toward others that we learn the precious lessons God designs for us. The great sacrifice of love made by the only-begotten Son of God, won the victory on our behalf. When will the people of God become pure, and true, and Christlike? When will they come out from the world and be separate? When will they open the door of their hearts and welcome the heavenly Guest?",
