    "word": "Through Christ, God works to bring man back to his first relation to his Creator, and to correct the disorganizing influences brought in by Satan. \n\n\n                                  - 101 - \n\nChrist alone stood unpolluted in a world of selfishness, where men would destroy a friend or brother in order to accomplish a scheme put into their minds by Satan. Christ came to our world, clothing His divinity with humanity, that humanity might touch humanity, and divinity grasp divinity. Amid the din of selfishness He could say to men, Return to your center, God. He Himself made it possible for man to do this by carrying out in this world the principles of heaven. In humanity He lived the law of God. To men in every nation, every country, every clime, He will impart heaven's choicest gifts if they will accept God as their Creator and Christ as their Redeemer.",
