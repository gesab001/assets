    "word": "PRAY FOR GOD\u2019S GUIDANCE.\u2014You must educate your judgment so that it shall not be feeble and inefficient. You must pray for guidance, and commit your way unto the Lord. You must close your heart against all foolishness and sin, and open it to every heavenly influence. You must make the most of your time and opportunities, in order to develop a symmetrical character.\u2014(Fundamentals of Christian Education, 302.)",
