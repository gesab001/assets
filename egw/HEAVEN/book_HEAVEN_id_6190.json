    "word": "A PLEASANT AND CHEERFUL HOME CAN BE HEAVEN ON EARTH.\u2014Parents, make your home a little heaven \n169\non earth. You can do this, if you so choose. You can make home so pleasant and cheerful that it will be the most attractive place on earth to your children. Let them receive all the blessings of the household. You can so relate yourselves to God that His Spirit will abide in your home. Come close to the bleeding side of the Man of Calvary. Those who are partakers with Him in His sufferings will at last be partakers with Him in His glory.\u2014Ms 77, 1902 quoted in PCP 31.",
