    "word": "Some will think that it is their special duty to be suspicious of you, and to hinder any advancement you may endeavor to make. It is not in their nature to restore and to build up; but this is ever the work of Jesus. They will not be pleased unless they make the erring feel their sinfulness of the past.

Jesus is rich in grace. Draw, constantly draw, from Him; for you may have rich supplies.",
