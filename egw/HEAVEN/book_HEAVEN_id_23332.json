    "word": "September 22. We had a very precious season in the early morning meeting. There were many prayers offered in French and English, and a number of interesting testimonies were given. I then gave a little talk upon faith, setting before them that it is our unbelief that is offensive to God, and withholds us from God. If our faith is in accordance with our light and privileges in this age, then heaven is open before us, and the rich promises of God are fulfilled concerning us; nothing is wanting that Christ requires. The experience and character of His followers should be equal to the talents received.",
