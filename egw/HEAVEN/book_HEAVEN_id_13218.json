    "word": "\"Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.\" Christ brought to our world a certain knowledge of God, and to all who received and obeyed his word, gave he power to become the sons of God. He who came forth from God to our world gave instruction on every subject about which it is essential that man should know in order to find the pathway to heaven. To him, truth was an ever-present, self-evident reality; he uttered no suggestions, advanced no sentiments, notions, or opinions, but presented only solid, saving truth.",
