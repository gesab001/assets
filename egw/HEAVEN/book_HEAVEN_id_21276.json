    "word": "Sister Richmond, who brought up these things, should have urged more weighty reasons against herself, why she should not have become a member of the church. Was she without sin? Were all her ways perfect before God? Was her patience, her self-denial, her gentleness, and forbearance, and calmness of temper, perfect? If \n                                                                           131\nshe was without the weakness of common women, then she could cast the first stone. But these sisters who were left out of the church were beloved of God. They were worthy of a place in the church. These were dealt with unwisely, without a sufficient cause, and there were others whose cases were handled with no more heavenly wisdom, or without even sound judgment. Bro. Waggoner's judgment and power of discrimination have been perverted for very many years through the influence of his wife, who has been a most effective medium of Satan. If Bro. Waggoner had possessed the genuine quality of independence, he would have had a proper self-respect, and with becoming dignity built up his own house. If he has started upon a course designed to command respect in his family, he has generally carried the matter too far, and has been severe, and has talked harshly and overbearing. He would become conscious of this after a time, and then go to the opposite extreme and come down from his independence.",
