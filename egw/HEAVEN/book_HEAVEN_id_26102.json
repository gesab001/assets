    "word": "God would have His honor exalted before men as supreme, and His counsels confirmed in the eyes of the people. The witness of the prophet Elijah on Mount Carmel gives the example of one who stood wholly for God and His work in the earth. The prophet calls the Lord by His name, Jehovah God, which He himself had given to denote His condescension and compassion. Elijah calls Him the God of Abraham and Isaac and Israel. He does this that he may excite in the hearts of his backslidden people humble remembrance of the Lord, and assure them of His rich free grace. Elijah prays, \"Be it known this day that thou art the God of Israel.\" The honor of God is to be exalted as supreme, but the prophet asks further that his mission also may be confirmed. \"Let it be known that Thou art God in Israel,\" he prays,\" and that I am Thy servant, and have done all things at Thy word.\" \"Hear me, O Lord,\" he pleads, \"Hear me.\" (944) Elijah is intense. As he prayed the silence of death seemed to be about him. As the Amen was spoken, lo, the fire of heaven descended on the sacrifices in sight of the multitude.",
