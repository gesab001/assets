    "word": "God has united believers in church capacity in order that one may strengthen another in good and righteous endeavor. The church on earth would indeed be a symbol of the church in heaven if the members were of one mind and one faith. It is those who are not worked by the Holy Spirit that mar God's plan. Another spirit takes possession of them and they help to strengthen the forces of darkness. Those who are sanctified by the precious blood of Christ will not become the means of counter-working the great plan which God Himself has devised. They will not bring human depravity into things small or great. They will not do anything to perpetuate division in the church.",
