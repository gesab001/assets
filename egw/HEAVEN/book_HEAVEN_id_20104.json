    "word": "The Work of God to Believe on Christ. \n\n     \"Then said they unto him, What shall we do that we might work the works of God?\" This was the question that was asked of Jesus by those who had witnessed his divine power in feeding the multitudes. But the question meant, What shall we do that we may deserve heaven? What is the price that we are required to pay that we may obtain the life to come? Now mark the answer of Jesus; for it is essential that we understand the truth he uttered: \"Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\" The price of heaven is Jesus. The way to heaven is through faith in \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Those who would be saved must accept by faith the righteousness of Christ; and when they do this, they will work the works of God.",
