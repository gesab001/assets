    "word": "Now, as never before, we need to understand the true science of education. If we fail to understand this, we shall never have a place in the kingdom of God. \"This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.\" If this is the price of heaven, shall not our education be given on these lines? Christ must be everything to us. \"Unto us a child is born, \n                                                                           57\nunto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, the Prince of peace.\" What foundation is here laid for the faith of those who shall live in all ages! When Christ ascended to heaven, he ascended as our Advocate. We always have a Friend at court. And from on high Christ sends his representative to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. The Holy Spirit gives the divine anointing to all who receive Christ.",
