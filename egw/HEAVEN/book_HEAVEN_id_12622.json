A Mark of Character.--[Revelation\n                                                                           978\n14:1-4 quoted.] This scripture represents the character of the people of God for these last days (MS 139, 1903).  {7BC 977.11} \n     (Revelation 14:9-12; see EGW on ch. 16:13-16.) The Signet of Heaven.--John saw a Lamb on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000 having His Father's name written in their foreheads. They bore the signet of heaven. They reflected the image of God. They were full of the light and the glory of the Holy One. If we would have the image and superscription of God upon us, we must separate ourselves from all iniquity. We must forsake every evil way, and then we must trust our cases in the hands of Christ. While we are working out our own salvation with fear and trembling, God will work in us to will and to do of His own good pleasure (RH March 19, 1889).",
