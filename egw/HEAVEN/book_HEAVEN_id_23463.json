    "word": "Christ has made it possible for man to rise in moral value with God. By resisting all wrong, by subduing the evil temper, selfishness, and pride, he may attain to the righteousness of Christ. Man is to become one with Christ in God. Sin is degrading, and there is no place for it in heaven. It is our privilege to have the power of self-control, and if we do not have it we reveal that sin still reigns in our mortal bodies. In Christ is all sufficiency for a self-directed life. \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me,\" He says, \"and he shall make peace with Me\" [Isaiah 27:5].",
