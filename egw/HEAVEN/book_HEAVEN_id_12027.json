    "word": "The Lord had given evidence that by His power He could in one short hour dissolve the whole frame of nature. He can turn things upside down, and destroy the things that man has built up in his most firm and substantial manner. He \"removeth the mountains,\" He \"overturneth them in his anger,\" He \"shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.\" \"The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.\" \"The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence.\"-- Manuscript 127, 1897.",
