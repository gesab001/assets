    "word": "Sunnyside, Cooranbong, N.S.W., Wednesday, Sept. 15, 1897. I am in an exhausted state; I have used my powers too much in writing. I am unable to use my brain now. I must rest my mind. The Lord is gracious unto me and I am very thankful to our heavenly Father that I am usually blessed with strength and health to write largely. The Lord is very merciful to me. My strength comes from Him.",
