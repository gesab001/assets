    "word": "The upbuilding of the kingdom of God is retarded or urged forward according to the unfaithfulness or fidelity of human agencies. The work is hindered by the failure of the human to cooperate with the divine. Men may pray, \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in \"heaven\"; but if they fail of acting out this prayer in their lives, their petitions will be fruitless.",
