    "word": "In the eighteenth of Matthew is an important lesson for us at this time. \"In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. And whoso receiveth one such little child in my name receiveth me: but whoso shall cause one of these little ones which believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.\" Read this whole chapter with humble heart softened by penitence and prayer. Does it mean anything to us?",
