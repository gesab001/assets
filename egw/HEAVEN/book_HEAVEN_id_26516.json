    "word": "[In] all the education given in any line to the black class [it] should be ever kept before them by the teacher that they [are] seeking to act their part as the Lord\u2019s missionaries to prepare them for a place in the Lord\u2019s family above, and the Lord would have them act properly according to His ways, and politely because they are to be the members of the royal family and children of the Lord Jesus Christ, their heavenly King. Keep this before the students every day in your schools, and when you do this you cannot speak harshly to them, neither can you be coarse and rough, because you could not harmonize your actions with the Bible principles.",
