    "word": "Under the zeal of Satan, some have for a time the appearance of men in a flourishing condition; but it is only for a season. Satan carried them so far that they do despite to the Spirit of God. They spread themselves like a green bay tree. The Lord suffers them for a time. He allows them to manifest their envy and hatred against the people of God, as he has allowed Satan to develop his character, that he might stand before the heavenly universe, before the world unfallen, and the fallen world, in his true attributes, as a deceiver, an accuser of the brethren, a murderer at heart.",
