    "word": "In Christ is our only hope. God has daily victories for His people to gain. . . . By His heavenly gifts the Lord has made ample provision for His people. An earthly parent can not give his child a sanctified character. He can not transfer his character to his child. God alone can transform us. Christ breathed on His disciples, and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\" This is the great gift of heaven. Christ imparted to them through the Spirit His own sanctification. He imbued them with His power, that they might win souls to the gospel. Henceforth Christ would live through their faculties, and speak through their words. They were privileged to know that hereafter He and they were to be one. They must cherish His principles and be controlled by His Spirit. They were no longer to follow their own way, to speak their own words. The words they spoke were to proceed from a sanctified heart, and fall from sanctified lips. No longer were they to live their own selfish life; Christ was to live in them. . . . He would give to them the glory that He had with the Father, that He and they might be one in God.",
