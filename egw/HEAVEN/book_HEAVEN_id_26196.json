    "word": "By dying for man, Jesus exalted humanity in the scale of moral value with God. The Son of the infinite God clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might become a steppingstone for every human being to heaven, that by His power humanity might be a partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. He is working to uplift and ennoble man, and He requires every soul that He has redeemed from hopeless misery to co-operate with Him in the great work of saving souls. Oh, if all could see this matter as it is presented before me, how soon would they cease to aid the enemy in his work! How they would despise his efforts to bring sin into the world! With what a perfect hatred they would hate sin, as they thought of how it cost the life of the Commander of heaven!",
