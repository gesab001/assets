Angels who minister to those that shall be heirs of salvation, are saying to every true saint, \"There is work for you to do.\" \"Go, stand and speak . . . to the people all the words of this life.\" Acts 5:20. If those addressed would obey this injunction, the Lord would prepare the way \n                                                                           260\nbefore them, putting them in possession of means wherewith to go.--Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 433, 434.",
