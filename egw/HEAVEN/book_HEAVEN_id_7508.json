    "word": "We are seldom, in all respects, placed in the same condition twice. . . . Each has his own experience, peculiar in its character and circumstances, to accomplish a certain work.

We all need them, and God is more than willing we should have them, if we will take them. He has not closed the windows of heaven to our prayers, but there are those who have felt satisfied to pass on without the divine help they so much need. . . .",
