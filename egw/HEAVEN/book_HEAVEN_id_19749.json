    "word": "Working of the Holy Spirit. \n\n     Obedience is the first price of eternal life. \"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your \n\n\n                       - 19 - \n\nremembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\" This is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Comforter is to reveal himself, not in any specified, precise way that man may mark out, but in the order of God; in unexpected times and ways that will honor his own name. Those who are unbelieving do not receive the richest endowment of grace, which would make them wise unto salvation, patient, forbearing, quick of perception to appreciate heavenly ministrations, quick to discern Satan's devices, and strong to resist him. God cannot do his mighty works for them, because of their unbelief.",
