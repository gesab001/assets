    "word": "In heaven, service is not rendered in the spirit of legality. When Satan in heaven rebelled against the law of Jehovah, the thought that there was a law came to the angels almost as an awakening to something they had not thought of. Love for God and for the Commander in high heaven, had been without one drawback. In their ministry the angels did not work as servants, they were not doing the will of God for wages, or to secure position; not to increase their importance or minister to their own pleasure; but their will was identical with the will of God. There was a perfect unity of taste and inclination between the angels and their Creator. Obedience was no drudgery to them. It was a delight.--Letter 4, 1892, p. 15. (To Sister A. G. Daniells, September 19, 1892.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. May 3, 1979",
