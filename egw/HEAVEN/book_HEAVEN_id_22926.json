    "word": "When we need grace constantly and forgiveness daily, and mercy and compassion every moment of our existence, how unbecoming and out of place for Christians to be so ready to criticize, censure, and condemn their brethren of like passions with themselves. The reproof is here given by our Redeemer for all such conduct. Much of this spirit is the result of self-esteem and of self-exaltation, striving for the supremacy lest others shall come in and fill a place higher than ourselves. But the lessons given on these points are marked, \"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" Meekness and humility must be cultivated continually in order to preserve the true spirit of Christianity.",
