    "word": "Man's word fails, and he who takes the assertions of man as his dependence may well tremble, for he will one day be as a shipwrecked vessel. But God's Word is infallible and endures forever. Christ declares, \"Verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled\" (Matthew 5:18). God's Word will endure through the ceaseless ages of eternity.",
