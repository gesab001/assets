    "word": "When this young man asked what he should do that he might gain eternal life, Christ answered him plainly. When he asked, \"What lack I yet?\" Jesus pointed out to him wherein he fell short. He failed when tested in regard to his worldly possessions. These were his idol. Distinctly and definitely Christ told him that his riches stood in the way of his gaining eternal life: \"If thou wilt be perfect,\" he said, \"go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\" But when he heard this, \"he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.\" He wanted the heavenly treasure, but he wanted also the temporal advantages his riches would bring him. He desired eternal life; but he \n\n\n                        -15- \n\nwas not willing to make the sacrifice. To give up his earthly treasure that was seen, for the heavenly treasure that was unseen, was too great a risk. He refused the offer of eternal life, and went away, and ever after the world was to receive his worship.",
