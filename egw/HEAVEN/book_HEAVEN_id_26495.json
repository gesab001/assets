    "word": "This young ruler was a man of prepossessing appearance and of much outward piety. He had high capabilities, and might have been a great blessing. But Christ saw in his character one great defect, which, unless remedied, would mar his whole life. His possessions were his idol. Unless these were given their proper place, they would rob him of eternal life. How kindly and tenderly the Saviour treated him. \u201cIf thou wilt be perfect,\u201d he said, \u201cgo and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.\u201d",
