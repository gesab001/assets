    "word": "But in heaven, service is not rendered in the spirit of legality. When Satan rebelled against the law of Jehovah, the thought that \n295\nthere was a law came to the angels almost as an awakening to something unthought of. In their ministry the angels are not as servants, but as sons. There is perfect unity between them and their Creator. Obedience is to them no drudgery. Love for God makes their service a joy. So in every soul wherein Christ, the hope of glory, dwells, His words are re-echoed, \u201cI delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\u201d Psalm 40:8.",
