    "word": "Men whom God has chosen for His special work must come into harmony with heaven. Earnest prayer for counsel and direction is necessary. If men will ask help of God, they will not ask in vain. The Lord comes near to His servants to encourage their confidence by His Word and promises, and by His Holy Spirit. He loves to have the weak and diffident come to Him for strength. If they will find heart and voice to pray, He will be sure to find an ear to hear and an arm to save.",
