    "word": "Try as hard as you will, you cannot manufacture a righteousness for yourself. Christ has woven in heaven's loom the robe of His righteousness, and He will put the same upon you. And your sins--your old, defiled citizen's garments--will be taken away. He points you to the fountain of living waters, whereby you may drink and drink again, and be refreshed. He bids you come unto Him with all your griefs, your pains, your weakness, and He says you shall find rest. Only believe that Jesus is your personal Saviour, that He pardons all your transgressions, and then rest in His love.",
