    "word": "The light is shining; it will not, cannot be eclipsed. It will continue to shine brighter and brighter unto the perfect day; but those who close their eyes that they shall not see, and their ears that they shall not hear, and harden their hearts that they shall not receive the rays of heavenly light, will be left to walk in darkness; and he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. He thinks he is walking in safe paths, but he deceives his own soul.",
