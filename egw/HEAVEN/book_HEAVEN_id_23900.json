    "word": "Today the question may well be asked, \"Whose side are you on--the side of the rabble, or the side of those who were met together to celebrate the sacred ordinance of baptism?\" God calls, Whose side are you on--the side of Christ or the side of the apostate? The responsibility of deciding on which side we shall stand is not small; for if by our example we encourage transgression, we must give an account to God. God calls upon all who are connected with the heavenly firm to employ their time and talents not to uplift and glorify themselves, but to advance His cause and promote His glory.",
