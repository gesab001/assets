    "word": "When Rome at one time determined to exterminate the hated sect, a bull was issued by the pope [INNOCENT VIII., A. D. 1487.] condemning them as heretics, and delivering them to slaughter. They were \n77\nnot accused as idlers, or dishonest, or disorderly; but it was declared that they had an appearance of piety and sanctity that seduced \u201cthe sheep of the true fold.\u201d Therefore the pope ordered \u201cthat the malicious and abominable sect of malignants,\u201d if they refuse to abjure, \u201cbe crushed like venomous snakes.\u201d Did this haughty potentate expect to meet those words again? Did he know that they were registered in the books of Heaven, to confront him at the Judgment? \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cye have done it unto me.\u201d [Matthew 25:40.]",
