    "word": "Brother M. J. Church, do not exalt to the heavens one who is full of weakness, because he is ready of tongue, and cast down another because he does not please you in all things, or because his ideas cross yours, and he will not sanction all you do. May the Lord God of heaven give his people wisdom in these days of peril. I have been shown, Brother Church, that you must have the sanctifying influence of Christ upon your heart continually, or you will reject the counsel of God, and follow your own counsel to your eternal ruin. Without him you will most assuredly walk in your own ways, in the sparks of your own kindling. You will approve that which God does not approve, and disprove that which is excellent. You will bless that which God does not bless, and condemn that which God does not condemn. You need divine enlightenment. You must work where God works, and listen to his voice, as to your leader and captain.",
