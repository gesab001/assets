    "word": "There is much to be done. Missionaries should be in the field, willing, if need be, to go to foreign countries to present the truth before those who sit in darkness. But there is little disposition among young men to consecrate themselves to God, and to devote their talents to his service. They are too willing to shun responsibilities and burdens. They are not obtaining an experience in burden-bearing, nor in the knowledge of the Scriptures, that they should have to fit them for the work that God would accept at their hands. It is the duty of all to see how much they can do for the Master who has died for them. But many are seeking to do just as little as possible, and cherish the faint hope of getting into Heaven. It is their privilege to have stars in their crown because of souls saved \n                                                                           114\nthrough their instrumentality. But, alas indolence and spiritual sloth prevail everywhere. Selfishness and pride occupy a large place in their hearts, and there is but little room for heavenly things.",
