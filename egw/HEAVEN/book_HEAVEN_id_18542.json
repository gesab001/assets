    "word": "As Christ and the angels approached the grave, Satan and his angels appeared at the grave, and were guarding the body of Moses, lest it should be removed. As Christ and His angels drew nigh, Satan resisted their approach, but was compelled, by the glory and power of Christ and His angels to fall back. Satan claimed the body of Moses, because of his one transgression; but Christ meekly referred him to His Father, saying, \u201cThe Lord rebuke thee.\u201d Christ told Satan that He knew that Moses had humbly repented of this one wrong, and no stain rested upon his character, and his name in the heavenly book of records stood untarnished. Then Christ resurrected the body of Moses.\u20144aSG 58.",
