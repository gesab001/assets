    "word": "All slow motions may be overcome by proper training. The youth who are trained to do their work with dispatch will have no slow, moderate, lazy habits of working. It is a great neglect on the part of parents to allow their children to occupy two hours in the work that could be performed in one. . . . Work is constantly being done in heaven. There are no idlers there. \"My Father worketh hitherto,\" said Christ, \"and I work.\" We cannot \n\n\n                                    -100- \n\nsuppose that when the final triumph shall come, and we have the mansions prepared for us, that idleness will be our portion, that we shall rest in blissful do-nothing state. . . .To every man He has given his work.--Ms 126, 1897, p. 4, 6.
