    "word": "The true ambassador for Christ is not given to jesting, trifling, idle talk, but he is cheerful, showing forth the praises of Him who hath called him out of darkness into His marvelous light. Every minister who after his discourse will engage in frivolous conversation counteracts the influence of his words in the sacred desk. He does no honor to God or to the truth, but brings the most sacred things down upon a level with the common things, and makes of no effect the truth of heavenly origin.",
