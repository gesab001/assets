    "word": "Those who have had privileges and opportunities and light upon light will find themselves brought into comparison with those whose religious advantages have been limited, and who have made diligent, persevering effort to lay hold of eternal life. Over such the Lord rejoiceth with singing. The whole heathen world will rise up in judgment against those whom heaven has favored the most, but have placed themselves on Satan's side, and worked in his lines to bring their soul destroying narcotics to foreign lands, to pollute and destroy the heathen nations with their defiling and health-destroying drugs. For the sake of revenue, a professedly Christian nation have forced their traffic upon heathen nations at the point of the sword, and thus compel them to accept their merchandise, which would in using degrade the people below the level of the brute creation.",
