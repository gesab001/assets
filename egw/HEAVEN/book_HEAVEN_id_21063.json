W., \n        Australia, June 8, 1898. \n\nDear Brethren in Battle Creek:-- \n     There are times when the truth must be spoken, whether men will hear, or whether they will forbear. The Lord is greatly dishonored when those who claim to believe the truth fail to harmonize among themselves, and make their appeals to lawyers. Will you study the word of God, and heed its instruction on this point? The interests of the cause of God are not to be committed to men who have no connection with heaven.",
