    "word": "7. Provide for Alternation of School and Labor.--\"The student should place himself in school, if he can, through his own exertions, pay his way as he goes. He should study one year, and then work out for himself the problem of what constitutes true education. He should set himself to work. The learning heaped up by years of continued study is deleterious to spiritual interests. Let teachers be prepared to give good counsel to the student who enters school. Let them not advise him to give years exclusively to the study of books. Let the youth learn, and then impart to others, the benefits he has received. If the student will humbly seek Him, the Lord of heaven will open his understanding. The student should take time to review what he has gained in book knowledge; he should critically examine the advancement he has made in the schoolroom, and he should combine physical exercise with study. Thus he will acquire an education that will enable him to come out with solid principles, an all-round man.\"--The \n                                                                           42\nYouth's Instructor, March 31, 1898, art. \"The True Object of Education.\"",
