    "word": "The case of N. Fuller has caused me much grief and anguish of spirit. That he should yield himself to the control of Satan to work \n                                                                           15\nwickedness as he has done, is terrible. I believe that God designed this case of hypocrisy and villainy should be brought to light in the manner it has been, to prove a warning to others. Here is a man acquainted with the Bible teachings. He has listened to testimonies that I have borne in his presence against the very sins he has been practicing. He has heard me speak, more than once, decidedly in regard to the prevailing sins of this generation, that corruption was teeming everywhere, that base passions controlled men and women generally; that among the masses crimes of the darkest dye were continually practiced, and they were reeking in their own corruption. The nominal churches are filled with these sins of fornication and adultery, crime and murder, the result of base, lustful passion, but these things are kept covered. Ministers, in high places, are guilty, yet a cloak of godliness covers their dark deeds and they pass on from year to year in their course of hypocrisy. Their sins have reached unto Heaven, and the honest in heart will be brought to the light, and come out of her.",
