    "word": "Simple and Inexpensive Foods\n     To many in different places the Lord will give intelligence in regard to health foods. He can spread a table in the wilderness. Health foods should be prepared by our churches who are trying to practice the principles of health reform. But as surely as they should do this, some would say that they are infringing on their rights. But who gave them wisdom to prepare these foods?- the God of heaven. That same God will give wisdom to His people in the different countries to use the productions of these countries in preparing health foods. In simple, inexpensive ways, our people are to experiment with the fruits and grains and roots in the country in \n53\nwhich they live. In the different countries inexpensive health foods are to be manufactured for the benefit of the poor.",
