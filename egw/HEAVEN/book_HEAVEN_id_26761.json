Steward: \n     Dear Brother,-- \n     I have received your letter, in which you inquire what is meant by the words \"I\", \"We,\" and so on, in my testimonies. In my work, I am connected with my helpers, and I am also connected and in close touch with my Instructor and other heavenly intelligences. Those who are called of God should be in touch with him through the operation of his Holy Spirit, that they may be taught by him.",
