    "word": "They only are truly blessed whose chief concern is to secure those blessings which will nourish the soul and endure forever. Our Saviour says to us, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" Matthew 6:33.  God has a care for us, even to bestow His temporal blessings upon us.  Our earthly good is not beneath the notice of our heavenly Father.  He knoweth that we have need of these things. . . .  When God smiles upon our efforts it is worth more than any earthly income.",
