    "word": "Children to be Educated from Earliest Years: \n     Fathers and mothers, to you God has entrusted children, and upon you rests a great responsibility, that of patiently and faithfully educating them. To fit your children to become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King is your first duty. You are responsible to God carefully to educate them, from their earliest years, to be kind and helpful, patient and forbearing.--Ms 42, 1903, p. 2. (\"The Training of Children,\" May 4, 1903.)",
