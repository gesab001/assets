    "word": "OUR VOICES REACH GOD\u2019S EAR.\u2014The word that was spoken to Jesus at the Jordan, \u201cThis is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,\u201d embraces humanity. God spoke to Jesus as our representative. With all our sins and weaknesses, we are not cast aside as worthless. \u201cHe hath made us accepted in the Beloved.\u201d Ephesians 1:6. The glory that rested upon Christ is a pledge of the love of God for us. It tells us of the power of prayer,\u2014how the human voice may reach the ear of God, and our petitions find acceptance in the courts of heaven. By sin, earth was cut off from heaven, and alienated from its communion; but Jesus has connected it again with the sphere of glory. His love has encircled man, and reached the highest heaven. The light which fell from the open portals upon the head of our Saviour will fall upon us as we pray for help to resist temptation. The voice which spoke to Jesus says to every\n87\nbelieving soul, This is My beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.\u2014(The Desire of Ages, 113.)",
