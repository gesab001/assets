    "word": "Those to whom have been given the goods of the Lord are not to live for themselves but for the cross of Calvary. A law has gone forth from heaven, \"He who liveth to himself is not a Christian.\" No more additions should be made to the pile of buildings already erected in Battle Creek. Limit your expenses, and practice the strictest economy. Show day by day that you believe that the Lord's means are to be invested where He shall choose, not where men's wisdom may dictate. They are to be invested where they will produce more means to use in the work of the Lord.",
