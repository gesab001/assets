    "word": "Chapter 19 -- The Music of Heaven\n\nA NEW SONG ABOUT TO BE SUNG.\u2014There is a day just about to burst upon us when God\u2019s mysteries will be seen, and all His ways vindicated; when justice, mercy, and love will be the attributes of His throne. When the earthly warfare is accomplished, and the saints are all gathered home, our first theme will be the song of Moses, the servant of God. The second theme will be the song of the Lamb, the song of grace and redemption. This song will be louder, loftier, and in sublimer strains, echoing and re-echoing through the heavenly courts. Thus the song of God\u2019s providence is sung, connecting the varying dispensations; for all is now seen without a veil between the legal, the prophetical, and the gospel.",
