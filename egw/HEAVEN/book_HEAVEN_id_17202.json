    "word": "An Appeal for Unity \n\n     Workers for Christ are to strive for unity. We are the children of the same family, and have one heavenly Father. Let us not put on garments of heaviness, and cherish doubts and a lack of confidence in our brethren. We should not hurt our souls by gathering the thistles and the thorns, but instead we should gather the roses and the lilies and the pinks, and express their fragrance in our words and acts. \n                                                                           503",
