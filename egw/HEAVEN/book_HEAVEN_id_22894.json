    "word": "Christ has bought the church with His own blood, and He is longing to clothe her with salvation. He has made her the repository of sacred, holy truth, and He wants her to partake of His glory. Again and again the Lord has sent His Spirit to change the attitude of His people by infusing into the church a living, working principle. But unconsecrated elements have been at work, and the church has been rocked to sleep in the cradle of carnal security. The God of Israel has opened the windows of heaven and sent to the world rich floods of light, but that light has been rejected. The spirit manifested in Battle Creek has been the spirit of many churches. The power of God, the rich grace He longs to bestow, is not desired unless men can themselves mark out the way in which God shall work.",
