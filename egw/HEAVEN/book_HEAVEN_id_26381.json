    "word": "We can be here only now and then. We have got more souls that are watching and waiting and begging for us to come, and we shall go as soon as we get through here, I expect. But I want to tell you we have a heaven to win, and a hell to shun! And it becomes us to be laborers together with Christ to redeem our souls in such a way that Christ shall say, Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Enter thou in to the joy of thy Lord. We are helping the Lord, and we want in all our schools to educate and train the youth, and we want the help of every soul that is in the place. The Son of God gave his life to redeem us, and what can we do for this? What can we do for all that are around us. We have got to act out the principles of heaven. We have got to try with all our might. And the Lord will help us, surely he will help us.",
