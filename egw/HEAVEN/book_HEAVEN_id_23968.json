    "word": "The life that men live is not half what it ought to be. Light is shining upon the subject of temperance, and much labor has been put forth to instruct people on this point, but the dietetic habits of those who live for selfish gratification, who do not wish to be corrected, and refuse to practice health reform, leave them diseased and enfeebled. They may ask the Lord to heal them, but will He who caused the light to shine out of darkness heal them of that which is the result of not heeding the light, but continuing to eat, drink, and dress unhealthfully? Shall we not seek to do all that is possible for us to do by placing ourselves in the right relation to health reform? Then we can say, \"Father in heaven, I have now done all I can to place myself in a correct position by denying appetite and following the light given in regard to health. Heal me of disease that I may glorify Thee.\"",
