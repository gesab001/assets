    "word": "The more our faith fastens to Christ in perfect trust, the more peace we shall have. Faith will grow by exercise. God's rule is, One day at a time. Day by day do the work for each day as if you are conscious that you are working in the sight of the angels, cherubim and seraphim, and God and Christ. You are \"a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men\" (1 Corinthians 4:9). \"Give us this day our daily bread\" (Matthew 6:11). \"As thy days, so shall thy strength be\" (Deuteronomy 33:25). \"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith\" (Hebrews 12:2). Living thus, the Holy Spirit helps our memory, sanctifies every faculty, and keeps us reminded of our daily and hourly dependence upon our heavenly Father's care, . . . and unceasing love.",
