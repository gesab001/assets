    "word": "Peter Delivered From Prison\n     The day of Peter's execution was at last appointed;\n232\nbut still the prayers of the believers ascended to Heaven. And while all their energies and sympathies were called out in fervent appeals, angels of God were guarding the imprisoned apostle. . . . Peter was placed between two soldiers, and was bound by two chains, each chain being fastened to the wrist of one of his guard. He was therefore unable to move without their knowledge. The prison doors were securely fastened, and a strong guard was placed before them. All chance of rescue or escape, by human means, was thus cut off.\u2014Redemption: or the Ministry of Peter and the Conversion of Saul, 70.",
