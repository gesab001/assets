    "word": "We are soldiers of Christ. He is the Captain of our salvation, and we are under his orders and rules. We are to wear his armor, we are to be marshaled only under his banner. We are to subdue, not our brother soldiers, but our enemies, that we may build up Christ's kingdom. We are laborers together with God. We are to keep on the whole armor of God, and work as in view of the universe of heaven. Let every man do his duty, as given him of God. \n                        Mrs. E. G. White. \n\n\n                         [47]",
