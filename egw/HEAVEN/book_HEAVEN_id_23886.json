    "word": "If you had been ever free from this spirit yourself, you would not be in the position you are. Unless the moral taste is refined, unless Christ becomes an abiding principle in the soul, but few of the youth will ever see heaven. They have misapplied their powers, perverted the privileges and opportunities given them, and will reap that which they have sown, a harvest which they will not be pleased to garner. Where great light has been given, great opportunities and privileges granted, there has been such a strengthening of unbelief, such determined resistance of light, such despising of God's divine favors, that I can see nothing for these thus favored but terrible judgments and wrath.",
