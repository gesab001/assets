    "word": "In the parable we are shown that every one has received something from the Master.  Each is to do his part in supplying the needs that occur in advancing the truth.  Property is a talent.  The Lord sends His message: \"Sell that ye have, and give alms.\"  All that we have is the Lord's, without any question. \"The silver is Mine \n                                                                           98\nand the gold is Mine,\" saith the Lord of hosts.  Why should we not, when pressed financially, present our great need to whose whom God has signified hold His money in trust, to be used in advancing the work of saving souls ready to perish?  We do not want you to sow sparingly, because then you will reap sparingly.  We want you, my brother, to lay up treasure in heaven. They that sow bountifully shall reap also bountifully. The reaping will be proportionate to the sowing.  Read the ninth chapter of Second Corinthians.",
