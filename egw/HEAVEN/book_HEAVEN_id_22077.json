    "word": "MR No. 338 - Elder J. N. Andrews and His Work\n\n     Now, I thought, these friends, out of the kindness of their hearts, have made me this present; now it is my privilege to use that gift in such a way that they may lay up treasure in heaven. I went to one of our merchants, a Sabbathkeeper, and said, \"Sell that dress for all you can get for it.\" He sold it for fifty dollars. Then I sent that money on here to the mission. The very act of my doing that brought in at that very time means from other individuals, and Brother Andrews wrote back to us that the very sum he wanted came at that time.--Manuscript 14, 1885. (\"Talk Before the European Council,\" September 20, 1885.)",
