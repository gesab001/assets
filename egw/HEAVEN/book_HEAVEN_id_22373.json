    "word": "MR No. 556 - Soul Winning\n\n     As professed Christians, what are we doing? Souls all around us, close beside our homes, and those afar off, are perishing in their sins, unwarned, uncared for. Every day we pass by those who are without hope and without God in the world, and never open our lips to tell them of Christ and His love. A worldly infatuation keeps men and women spellbound. We profess to have the light from heaven, precious knowledge of the truth, of God's requirements; and yet how many of us are dumb while our fellowmen are blind, deceived, perishing in their sins. Soldiers of the cross of Christ should be moving heaven with their prayers for God to work, for His power to cooperate with the human agent to reach men where they are. Oh, why will not men hear the words of Christ: \"He that is not with Me is against me; and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad\" (Matt 12:30). . . .",
