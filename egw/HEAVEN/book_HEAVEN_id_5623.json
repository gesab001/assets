    "word": "Many are deceived as to their true condition before God. They congratulate themselves upon the wrong acts which they do not commit, and forget to enumerate the good and noble deeds which God requires of them, but which they have neglected to perform. It is not enough that they are trees in the garden of God. They are to answer his expectation by bearing fruit. He holds them accountable for their failure to accomplish all the good which they could have done, through his grace strengthening them. In the books of Heaven they are registered as cumberers of the ground. Yet the case of even this class is not utterly hopeless. With those who have slighted God's mercy and abused his grace, the heart of long-suffering love yet pleads. \u201cWherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye \n602\nwalk circumspectly, . . . redeeming the time, because the days are evil.\u201d [Ephesians 5:14-16.]",
