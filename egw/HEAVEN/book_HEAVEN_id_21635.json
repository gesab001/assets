    "word": "When Christ comes from heaven in the clouds He will then give eternal life to those who have been found faithful to their trust. Oh, what joy it will be to those that are worthy! They can then say with the apostle Paul, \n\n\n                                     -70- \n\n\"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\" 2 Corinthians 4:17. Shall we not work for the Master? We must put our best intellect to work for the Master. We must confess Christ to the world in His matchless charms. Christ will soon come. Have we done our work? Can we say like the apostle, \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith\"? 2 Timothy 4:7.",
