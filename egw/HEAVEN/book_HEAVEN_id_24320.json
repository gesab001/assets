    "word": "I grew worse Sunday, but a large hall had been hired, [and] notices had been sent out that I would speak. John Vuilleumier came from Bale to interpret; and although suffering severe spasms of pain. I spoke to three hundred people assembled in the hall. The meeting was pronounced a success, but I dared not remain another night. I had them make arrangements to return to Bale Sunday night after speaking in afternoon. Well, I spoke New Year's to all who could understand English, and the Lord met with us. I became very sick, yet spoke again last Sabbath, and the week now about past has been a week of peril to me, but the worst is past. I feel very thankful to my heavenly Father.",
