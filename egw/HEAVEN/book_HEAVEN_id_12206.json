    "word": "18. The Reservoir of Heaven Not Locked.--The Bible should be studied with prayer. We should pray as did David, \"Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.\" No man can have insight into the Word of God without the illumination of the Holy Spirit. If we will but come into the right position before God, His light will shine upon us in rich, clear rays. This was the experience of the early disciples. . . . [Acts 2:1-4 quoted.] God is willing to give us a similar blessing, when we seek for it as earnestly.",
