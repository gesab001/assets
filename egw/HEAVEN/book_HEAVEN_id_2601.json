    "word": "Eternal Riches Slighted \n\n     The Lord looks with pity on those who allow themselves to be burdened with household cares and business perplexities. They are cumbered with much serving, and neglect the one thing essential. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,\" the Saviour says; \"and all these things shall be added unto you.\" That is, Look away from this world to the eternal. Put forth your most earnest endeavors to obtain those things upon which God places value, and which Christ gave His precious life that you might secure. His sacrifice has thrown open wide to you the gates of heavenly commerce. Lay up your treasure \n                                                                           226\nbeside the throne of God, by doing with His entrusted capital the work that He desires done in the winning of souls to a knowledge of the truth. This will secure you eternal riches. . . .",
