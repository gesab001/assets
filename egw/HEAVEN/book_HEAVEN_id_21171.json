Each should cleanse his own soul \n                                                                           77\ntemple from its defilement. Let envy and jealousy go with the accumulated rubbish. Exalted privileges and heavenly attainments, purchased for us at an immense cost, are freely presented for our acceptance. God holds us individually accountable for the measure of light and privileges he has given us. And if we refuse to render unto God the improvement of the talents committed to our trust, we forfeit his favor.",
