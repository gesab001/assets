    "word": "Think of Jesus, of the trials, the mockings, the derision, and the agonizing suffering He endured to save the fallen race. Can we ask for greater evidences of His love for us? He for our sakes became poor that we through His poverty might be made rich. He was the Majesty of heaven, yet He left His glory, His riches, His high command, and consented to a life of humiliation and suffering and to an ignominious death, that He might exalt the fallen sons and daughters of Adam to His own right hand.",
