    "word": "Yes, we are the Lord's blood-bought heritage. \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God\" (1 Corinthians 10:31). This God requires of every one who shall compose His family in the kingdom of heaven. All selfishness must be overcome. We must be true to God, true as steel to all His commandments. Human beings frame laws, and are very zealous for their enactment. At the same time they transgress the highest law from the mightiest Sovereign. This they attempt to make null and void. They exalt the human above the divine. \"Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord of hosts\" (Jeremiah 5:9). Yes, God will reward every man according to his works.-- Manuscript 70, July 30, 1897, diary.",
