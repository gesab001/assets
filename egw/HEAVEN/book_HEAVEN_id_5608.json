    "word": "Those who oppose the teachings of Spiritualism are assailing, not men alone, but Satan and his angels. They have entered upon a contest against principalities and powers and wicked spirits in high places.

Those who would stand in this time of peril must understand for themselves the testimony of the Scriptures.",
