    "word": "I can tell you instance after instance that I know of, of men who have been warned and reproved, who have sat here in this house and listened to discourse after discourse, but in the place of being doers of the Word, in the place of receiving the Word of God into good and honest hearts, in the place of working with all their might in harmony with heaven, they have hugged their sins to themselves. And then what? The seal of God could not be upon them, and when calamities came, when placed in perilous positions, those very ones have gone down into the grave, and they will not come up in the first resurrection. They will not see the King in His beauty. They were lost simply because they took their own way. They broke away from the Spirit of God and kept venturing and venturing, and tasting and testing the wiles of the devil.",
