    "word": "Christ has come very near to me in my great weakness and failing voice. I am now changed for the better, \n\n\n                                     -312- \n\nhealthwise, but in my greatest feebleness I have been uplifted and comforted. Once I thought I must almost be in heaven. I seemed to be encircled in the arms of Jesus Christ as if He were carrying me and all my burdens. My peace has often been as a river, and the righteousness thereof as the waves of the sea. [Isaiah 48:18.]",
