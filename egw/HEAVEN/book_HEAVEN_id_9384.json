    "word": "The work of building one another up in the most holy faith is a blessed work, but the work of tearing down is a work full of bitterness and sorrow. Christ identifies Himself with His suffering children, for He says, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\u201d (Matthew 25:40). . . . Every heart has its own sorrows and disappointments, and we should seek to lighten one another\u2019s burdens by manifesting the love of Jesus to those around us. If our conversation were upon heaven and heavenly things, evil speaking would soon cease to have any attraction for us. . . .",
