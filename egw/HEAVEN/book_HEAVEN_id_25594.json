    "word": "Two weeks ago my last teeth were extracted. Sr. Caro, a dentist, came from Napier and performed the operation. I have felt that I must not call the blood to the brain, and I have had to be extremely careful lest I should take cold in my gums. My gums heal slowly. I am happy to say, I am in unusually good health; for this I render thanks to my heavenly Father. Of late, I have been sleeping much better, not because I have taken any nervines. I took nothing whatever when the teeth were extracted. The operation was performed in less than five minutes. I do not expect to be able to do any speaking until I get my underset; that will be in about eight weeks. I feel thankful indeed to the Lord for his goodness. I have not rode out for the last five weeks. The weather has been very unsettled, except to rain most of the time. I am not able to walk only a very short distance; my right hip forbids it. I can move quite actively about the house. My room is up-stairs and I go up and down quite often; but a little exercise at a time is all I can bear. I sit on a lounge most of the time, for the easiest position for me is to extend my limbs even with my body. I suffer no pain except in my hip, and unless I sit in just such a position I become almost helpless. I suffered for about four weeks with a severe pain in the hip, caused from my walking to the hall where we held our meetings.",
