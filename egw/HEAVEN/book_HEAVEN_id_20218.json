    "word": "I was pointed to the Majesty of Heaven. He whom angels worshiped, he who was rich in honor, splendor, and glory, came to the earth, and when he found himself in fashion as a man, he did not plead his refined nature as an excuse to hold himself aloof from the unfortunate. He was found in his work among the afflicted, the poor, distressed, and needy ones. Christ was the embodiment of refinement and purity. His was an exalted life and character, yet he was found in his labor, not among men of high-sounding titles, not among the most honorable of this world, but with the despised and needy. \"I came,\" says the divine Teacher, \"to save that which was lost.\" Yes, the Majesty of Heaven was ever found working to help those \n                                                                           42\nwho most needed help. May the example of Christ put to shame the excuses of that class who are so attracted to their poor self that they consider it beneath their refined taste and their high calling to help the most helpless. Such have taken a position higher than their Lord, and in the end will be astonished to find themselves lower than the lowliest of that class their refined, sensitive natures were shocked to mingle with and work for. True, it may not always be agreeable or pleasant to unite with the Master and be co-workers with him in helping the very class who stand most in need of help. But this is the work Christ humbled himself to do. Is the servant greater than his Lord? He has given the example, and enjoins upon us to copy it. It may be disagreeable, yet duty demands that just such a work be performed. There has been a serious lack in Battle Creek; a few of a certain class have run together, gossiped together, associated almost wholly together, and neglected their neighbors and society around them. They have felt no interest to become acquainted with the people around them, with the purpose of removing the prejudice from their minds and enlightening them in regard to the truth. How far have they let their light shine before men, that they seeing their good works may glorify our Father who art in Heaven? They have put their light under a \n                                                                           43\nbushel, and hid it in their own houses. They have not felt that their neighbors and the society around them had claims upon them, and they have not feared that they would rise in the Judgment and condemn them for their neglect of showing them the way of salvation.",
