    "word": "God knows all the actuating principles of the minds He has formed, and with what spirit they will act when under temptation. He has witnessed the persistent, rebellious course of some whom He has forbidden to follow their own plans and devisings, but who refuse to cease their evil-doing. The ways of man are before the Lord, and He pondereth all his goings. He knoweth the thoughts that come into every mind. The eyes of the Lord are in every place. \n                                                                           57\nHe looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heavens. The Lord searcheth all hearts.",
