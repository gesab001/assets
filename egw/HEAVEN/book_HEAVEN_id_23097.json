    "word": "Because of the slack, slipshod way the landholders cultivate their farms, nothing flourishes as it should, and the impression made upon those who view the land is that it is too poor to yield a good crop.

But where such immense trees flourish as flourish here, many of them growing up perfectly straight toward heaven, I am convinced that with the blessing of God, with diligence and faithfulness in working the land, farmers might \n\n\n                                 -350- \n\nproduce gratifying results, and in return for the labor put forth they might reap a good harvest.",
