    "word": "Trial. Christians must not be discouraged by trial and hardship. These they will surely have. They are a part of their legacy. If the Master left His heavenly home to come to a world where He was despised and rejected, shall we complain when trial comes to us in so many ways? Let us cheerfully partake with Christ of His suffering. Then we shall be partakers with Him of His glory.",
