    "word": "The sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire being--spirit, soul, and body. . . . Christians are bidden to present their bodies, \"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God\" (Romans 12:1). In order to do this, all their powers must be preserved in the best possible condition. Every practice that weakens physical or mental strength unfits man for the service of his Creator. . . . Said Christ: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart\" (Matthew 22:37). Those who do love God with all the heart will desire to give Him the best service of their life, and they will be constantly seeking to bring every power of their being into harmony with the laws that will promote their ability to do His will. They will not, by the indulgence of appetite or passion, enfeeble or defile the offering which they present to their heavenly Father.",
