    "word": "Now we want to know and understand what is the will of God. This will is expressed in the Ten Commandments, and if we obey them we shall know of the doctrine. The Lord God of heaven has a kingdom and this kingdom is controlled by laws, and it is of great consequence that these laws be obeyed. God is the ruler of the universe and stands as head, and all should respect Him as such, and obey His mandates. A father stands at the head of his family and he requires that his laws regulating his family should be obeyed. If the family do respect his requirements, then you will see order and happiness in that family, but if it is otherwise there will be confusion. So it will be in the government of God. \n\n\n                                  -100-",
