    "word": "Arbitrary authority to be avoided\n     Never should parents scold their children. Never should they administer punishment while in a fit of passion. Children cannot be trained aright in this manner. Angry parents need to be chastened by the rod themselves, instead of chastening their children. Punishment in anger only hurts and provokes. Do you want a home in heaven? We are all desirous of reaching heaven. But does anyone desire to reach heaven in order that he may fret and scold or punish in anger, and exercise arbitrary authority? On the other hand, do we not desire to reach heaven because peace reigns there; because on every side we shall hear the words, \u201cThy gentleness hath made me great\u201d?",
