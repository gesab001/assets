    "word": "MR No. 490 - The Melrose Sanitarium\n\n     I have words to speak to the employees of the Melrose Sanitarium; for there is a work that needs to be done in and around the sanitarium that they are neglecting. I have been deeply pained as the situation has been presented before me. The physician and the general manager need not expect to receive the especial blessing of the Lord upon the institution while they leave undone the very work that is most essential. I am instructed to say to the men now holding offices of responsibility in the Melrose Sanitarium: A thorough work of conversion needs to be done for you both. You need to realize that your position of responsibility and your profession as intelligent Christians call for heart service rendered in the love and fear of God. You should understand your need of the converting power of the grace of Christ. If as converted men you will work out in your experience the principles of true religion, you will receive the choicest of heaven's blessings.",
