    "word": "As Long as Probation Lasts\nAs long as probation continues, there will be opportunity for the canvasser to work. When the religious denominations unite with the papacy to oppress God's people, places where there is religious freedom will be opened by evangelistic canvassing. If in one place the persecution becomes severe, let the workers do as Christ has directed. \u201cWhen they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\u201d If persecution comes there, go to still another place. God will lead His people, making them a blessing in many\n100\nplaces. Were it not for persecution they would not be so widely scattered abroad to proclaim the truth. And Christ declares: \u201cYe shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.\u201d Matthew 10:23. Until in heaven is spoken the word, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d there will always be places for labor, and hearts to receive the message.\u2014Testimonies, Vol. 6, page 478.",
