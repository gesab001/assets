    "word": "Those who name the name of Christ should adopt Christian maxims. They should fear to ridicule the message or the messenger. Let no man say that this conversation is in heaven, while he is manifestly groveling in the dust, and his thoughts and feelings are as far separated from God as the east from the west. The true Christian will fear to make light of God's message, lest he may lay a stumbling block in the way of a soul who may see and imitate his example.",
