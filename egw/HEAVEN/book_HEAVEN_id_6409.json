    "word": "We need men who fear God, men who mean to learn, and who will labor with an eye single to his glory. The workers need to come closer to God than they have done. They must have his converting power upon the heart in order that he may impart to them wisdom and knowledge as he did to Daniel, and make them channels of light to others. Let those who are to be educators of others seek God daily for this heavenly endowment, that the understanding may be quick and clear, and that the beauty of holiness may be revealed in the character. God will help them if they seek him. Those who have been under their instruction may be presented before God ready to do his work with thoroughness and fidelity.",
