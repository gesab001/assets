    "word": "Let the light of truth shine into the mind of a man, let the love of God be shed abroad in his heart, and we can hardly conceive what he may be or what God can do through him. Though a fallen son of Adam, he may, through the merits of Christ, be an heir of immortality, his thoughts elevated and ennobled, his heart purified, and his conversation in heaven. Think, O, think of the \n147\nsuperiority of an intelligent Christian man over a poor votary of sin! Note the difference between man blinded by sin, the victim of his own evil passions, and sunk in vice, and a man reclaimed by the truth of God's word, ennobled by looking to Jesus and believing in him, and becoming a partaker of the divine nature.",
