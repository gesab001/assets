    "word": "\"Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled.\" As long as heaven and earth remain, not one jot or tittle will pass from the law. As long as there is a canopy of heaven above our heads, and the earth beneath our feet, there should be no argument or controversy over this question. Until this evidence is fulfilled before your eyes, you may be sure that the law of Jehovah will hold its exalted place.",
