    "word": "There are quicksands upon which many are in danger of being swamped. It is always safe to seek for the earnest of the Spirit of God, if we do not mingle with it a force and presumption that is not heaven born. There is need of caution in all our utterances lest some poor souls of ardent temperament shall work themselves up into a zeal not according to knowledge. They will act as though it was their prerogative to use the Holy Spirit instead of letting the Holy Spirit use them, and mold and fashion them after the pattern of the divine. There is danger of running ahead of Christ. We should honor the Holy Spirit by following where it shall lead. \"Lean not unto thine own understanding\" (Proverbs 3:5). This is one danger of those who teach the truth to others. To follow where \n                                                                           60\nChrist leads is a safe path for our feet. His work will stand. Whatsoever God saith is truth.",
