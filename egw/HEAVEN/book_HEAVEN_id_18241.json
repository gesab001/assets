    "word": "Satan\u2019s plan has taken with the religious world. He has created an order of things entirely his own, making void the law of God. Through his deceptive working he has gained in the professedly Christian world that which he thought to gain in heaven\u2014an abrogation of the laws of Jehovah. Through the Roman power he has worked to remove God\u2019s memorial, and has erected a memorial of his own to sever God from His people. Today the Protestant world is estranged from God by its acceptance of a spurious sabbath. Not one iota of sacred authority can they find for doing this; yet, full of zeal, they assert that the Lord\u2019s memorial given at creation should be ignored, despised, trampled upon, and the first day of the week take its place.",
