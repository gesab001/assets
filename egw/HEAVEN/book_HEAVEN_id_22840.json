    "word": "I have the greatest interest in you. I understand you much better than you understand yourself. It is not only your privilege, but it is your duty to seek a character so consistent that sin will find no place in your words or actions. Walk wisely in your home. Walk wisely before your patients and your students, that when you bow in prayer, the Lord can hear and answer you. Walk wisely in a perfect way. Let your words be seasoned with the grace of Christ. Let the Christlikeness of your words and actions be a sign between you and Christ's followers that you walk with God. Let the peace of Christ rule in your heart. Let its power strengthen and mellow your disposition. In all your associations, reveal the uplifting principles of heaven, that when your work here shall close, only the fragrance of your good works and words may be remembered.",
