    "word": "Then as you meet from Sabbath to Sabbath, sing praises to Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. \"Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood\" let the heart's adoration be given. Let the love of Christ be the burden of the speaker's utterance. Let it be expressed in simple language in every song of praise. Let the inspiration of the Spirit of God dictate your prayers. As the word of life is spoken, let your heartfelt response testify that you receive the message as from heaven.",
