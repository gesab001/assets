    "word": "But how many offer praise and thanksgiving to God? How many, by thanking the Giver, show that they appreciate their blessings? How many give thanks to the Father, \"which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light? We have redemption through His blood. He has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of His Son. The heavenly angels are constantly engaged in serving us, bringing to us the most wonderful opportunities. Why then should we be so slow to express our thanksgiving? Whoso offereth praise glorifieth God. A fragrant atmosphere surrounds the believing, thankful soul who offers grateful praise to His heavenly Father. Let all appreciate the blessings of the Lord. We reflect bright beams of light when in the home and in the church we express our appreciation of the Lord's goodness. \n\n\n                                     -257-",
