    "word": "Christ has said: \"By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another\" (John 13:35). This, then, is the credential we bear to the world that we are indeed children of God. Satan knows that if we cease to cultivate love we bear his stamp rather than the impress of heaven. We should inquire, Are we to dwell together in heaven? Then it must be in peace and harmony, and we must learn to harmonize in this world. Our work, our feelings, our actions must be Christlike. There are laborers that can work together in harmony.",
