    "word": "So confessions will be made by the guilty when they stand before the bar of God, after every case has been decided for life or death. . . . When the records of heaven shall be opened, the Judge will not in words declare to man his guilt, but will cast one penetrating, convicting glance, and every deed, every transaction of life, will be vividly impressed upon the memory of the wrongdoer. The person will not . . . need to be hunted out . . . but his own lips will confess his shame. The sins hidden from the knowledge of men will then be proclaimed to the whole world.",
