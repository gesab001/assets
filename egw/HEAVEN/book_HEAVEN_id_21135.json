    "word": "Paul is a boy who has good qualities as well as objectionable traits of character. His evil traits have been cultivated and indulged rather than restrained. You have not taught him the sinfulness of a sullen, stubborn disposition, and firmly restrained this growing evil, and even in the expression of his countenance your indulgence is leaving its mould. The impressions \n\n\n                          [19] \n\nmade in youth are most abiding, and early life is the best time to cultivate correct habits. Paul has been encouraged to be exacting and particular in his diet at the table, but you should set the food before him, and never allow him to turn from it in disdain, calling for something that you have not provided. He may cherish his exacting habits in regard to his diet, until he shall be disagreeable to himself and all connected with him. If he were obliged to labor according to his strength, hunger would give him a relish for his food and remove his murmuring. Decided measures should be taken in this matter. I love this son of yours; he can be moulded in the right way, for if properly trained he will respond after a time. You should never allow your children to find fault with their food, to murmur because spice, pepper, pickles, and condiments are not placed before them. You should not allow them to indulge largely in meat eating, unless you want them to become nervous, irritable, and discontented. Give your boy something to do. Teach him to be industrious. He has naturally no love for work; he loves indolence and seeks to shirk responsibility. If you want your children to bless you, teach them to be useful and self-denying. Restrict their reading. They should not be allowed to pour over the pages of novels or story books, filled with the tales of lust and knavery, for it will not leave a heavenly influence on their minds. They are young and inexperienced, and will be just what you make them. All such habits of reading will cut up by the roots the principles of virtue which enter into the formation of a good, firm character. Novel reading is like taking poison, and will sooner or later reveal its \n\n\n                         [20] \n\nbitter results. The mark for good or evil made upon the characters of your children is not written in the sand, but is traced as on enduring rock. Their associations will have to be guarded; for what is learned from the words and habits of their companions, will mould the whole after life. The company your children keep, the principles they now adopt, the habits they now form, are settling the destiny of their future with an almost infallible certainty.",
