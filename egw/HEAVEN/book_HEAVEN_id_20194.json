    "word": "Why are the churches so indolent? Why have they no burden for the souls for whom Christ died? and how does heaven regard their inefficiency? The angels are constantly earnest and active, seeking to bring every child of God to work in the vineyard of the Lord. Oh, how they rejoiced when they saw that through the word of Christ the world was brought back into favor and position with God, and again connected with heaven, to be benefited with all the treasures of light and knowledge emanating therefrom; and they sorrow when they see that those for whom so much has been done have no interest to win souls for Christ.",
