    "word": "The outlook is not flattering, but notwithstanding this, let us not give up our efforts to save those who have had an experience but are ready to perish, for whose ransom the Prince of heaven offered up his precious life. When one means fails, try another way. Our efforts must not be dead and lifeless. As long as life is spared, let us work for God. In all ages of the church God's appointed messengers have exposed themselves to reproach and persecution for the truth's sake. But wherever God's people may be forced to go, even though, like the beloved disciple, they are banished to desert islands, Christ will know where they are, and will strengthen and bless them with peace and joy.",
