    "word": "We are to give sincere, earnest attention to the instruction of Christ, realizing the importance of hearing correctly, that God may use us in instructing others. \"With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" The measure of the earnestness with which you hear My Word, that you \n\n\n                                    -227- \n\nmay benefit others, will be the measure which will be given back to you. To him who hath, who listens intently that he may receive knowledge to lay up in the treasure-house and impart to others, shall be given; for God sees that he will use his knowledge aright. He who hath not, who has not improved his opportunities, who has not practiced the truth, that others may see the blessing of his knowledge, shall be taken away, even that which he hath. His opportunity to be all that God designed he should be, receiving and imparting the light of heaven, shall be taken away from him.--Ms 103, 1901, pp. 4, 5.
