    "word": "God has laid upon us the obligation of giving special attention to the poor among us.  But these ministers and workers are not to be ranked with the poor. They have laid up for themselves a treasure in the heavens that faileth not. They have served the conference in its necessity, and now the conference is to serve them. When cases of this kind come before us, we are not to pass by on the other side.  We are not to say, \"Be ye warmed and filled\" (James 2:16), and then take no active measures to supply their necessities.  This has been done in the past, and thus in some cases Seventh-day Adventists have dishonored their profession of faith and have given the world opportunity to reproach the cause of God.",
