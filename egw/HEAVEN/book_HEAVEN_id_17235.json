    "word": "As a people we must practise self-denial and economy.  Every soul should make a covenant with God by sacrifice. We should not expend money in extra expensive clothing, and rich furniture. We are pilgrims and strangers seeking a better country, even an heavenly. Time is short, and every dollar not necessary to be used in supplying positive wants, should be brought in as a thank offering to God. It is the Lord's, and the Lord has presented to me that houses of worship, and schoolhouses should be erected through this country, and in the islands of the sea; that our leading men should not build for display, or to gratify ambition and pride. If the Lord has favoured them above their brethren in other countries, let them in true liberality assist those who greatly need to be helped to find a standing place, and give character to the work.",
