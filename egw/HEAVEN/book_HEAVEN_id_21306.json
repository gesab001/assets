    "word": "Our people connected with the Office have not been awake to improve the privileges within their reach, and secure all the talent and influence that God has provided for them. There is a very great failure with nearly all connected with the Office of realizing the importance and sacredness of the work. Pride and selfishness exist to a very great degree, and angels of God are not attracted to that Office as they would be if hearts were pure and in communion with God. Those laboring in the Office have not had a vivid sense that the truths that they were handling were of heavenly origin, to accomplish a certain and special work as did the preaching of Noah before the flood. As the preaching of Noah warned, tested, and proved, the inhabitants of the world before the flood of waters destroyed them from off the face of the earth, so is the truth of God for these last days doing a similar work of warning, testing, and proving the world. The publications which go forth from the Office bear the signet of the Eternal. They are being scattered all through the land, and are deciding the destiny of souls. Men are now greatly needed who can translate and prepare our publications in other languages to reach all \n                                                                           107\ntongues, and that the messages of warning may go to all nations, that they may be tested by the light of the truth, that men and women, as they see the light, may turn from the transgression to the obedience of the law of God.",
