    "word": "The messengers of Christ, those whom he sends in his stead, will have the same feelings, the same earnest interest. And those who are tempted to think that their labor is not appreciated, and are inclined to be discouraged, should remember that Jesus, the Majesty of heaven, had just as hard hearts to deal with, and he had a more trying experience than we have had or ever can have. He taught the people with patient love, and his deep, searching wisdom knew the wants of every soul among his listeners. And when he saw them refuse the message of peace and love he came to give them, his heart felt anguish to the very depths.",
