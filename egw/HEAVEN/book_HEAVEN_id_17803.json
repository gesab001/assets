    "word": "Not one jot or tittle of God's holy requirements will ever be changed to meet man in his unready condition. His holy Word will never change or be done away. The world is asleep in their sins. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but His Word can never pass away. All of us must be guided by the Word of God. What a work is before us, and professed Christians realize it not! \"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 18:3). . . .",
