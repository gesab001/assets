    "word": "In his zeal in persecuting the Christians, Paul had been arrested by a voice and a great light from heaven. During his ministerial labors he had several visions, of which he speaks little. He saw and heard many things \n\n\n                                     -345- \n\nnot lawful for a man to utter. That which was given him as a special revelation from God was not at all times dwelt upon when he spoke to the people, but the impression was ever with him, enabling him to give a correct representation of the Christian life and character. The impression made upon this former persecutor of the church was never to lose its force upon his mind. It influenced his estimation and delineation of Christian character and of the obligation due from man to God.",
