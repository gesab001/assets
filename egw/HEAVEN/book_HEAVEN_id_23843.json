They allow the blessings that God has given them to separate them from Him, and the more He entrusts to them the more they forget Him. He has put means into your hands to advance His cause, and [do] you use it to your own glory? Jesus came into the world and became poor that we through His poverty might be made rich. Listen to His words, \"Lay not up for yourselves \n\n\n                                   -136- \n\ntreasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\" (Matthew 6:19-21).",
