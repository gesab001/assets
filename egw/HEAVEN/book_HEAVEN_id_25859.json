    "word": "Through being overcome with sleep, the disciples heard little of what passed between Christ and the heavenly Messengers. Failing to watch and pray, they had not received the light that God desired to give them, - a knowledge of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow. They lost the blessings that might have been theirs by sharing His self-sacrifice. Slow of heart to believe were these disciples, little appreciative of the treasure with which heaven sought to enrich them.",
