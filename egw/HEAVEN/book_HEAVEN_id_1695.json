    "word": "Chap. 20 - Our Large Message Books\n\n     Books That Reveal Light on Satan's Apostasy.--[NOTE: THE READER MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, SINCE THESE STATEMENTS WERE PENNED, A NUMBER OF LARGE MESSAGE-FILLED BOOKS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED AND ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR COLPORTEURS.--COMPILERS.] Instruction has been given me that the important books containing the light that God has given regarding Satan's apostasy in heaven should be given a wide circulation just now; for through them the truth will reach many minds. Patriarchs and Prophets, Daniel and the Revelation, and The Great Controversy are needed now as never before. They should be widely circulated because the truths they emphasize will open many blind eyes. . . . Many of our people have been blind to the importance of the very books that were most needed. Had tact and skill then been shown in the sale of these books, the Sunday-law movement would not be where it is today.--Review and Herald, Feb. 16, 1905.",
