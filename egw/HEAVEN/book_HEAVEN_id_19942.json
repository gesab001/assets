    "word": "Do we expect to meet our brethren in heaven? If we can live with them here in peace and harmony, we could live with them there. But how could we live with them in heaven if we can not live with them here without continual contention and strife? Those who are following a course of action that separates them from their brethren, and brings in discord and dissension, need a thorough conversion. Our hearts must be melted and subdued by the love of Christ. We must cherish the love that He showed in dying for us on the cross of Calvary. We need to draw closer and closer \n                                                                           28\nto the Saviour. We should be much in prayer, and we must learn to exercise faith. We must be more tenderhearted, more pitiful and courteous. We shall pass through this world but once, and shall we not strive to leave on those with whom we associate, the impress of the character of Christ.",
