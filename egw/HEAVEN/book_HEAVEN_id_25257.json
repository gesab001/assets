    "word": "I arose at half past three o'clock and devoted some time to seeking the Lord. I wish we all understood the experience of really seeking the Lord. Isaiah tells us when we call He will answer, \"Here I am\" (Isaiah 58:9). We want to come into personal relation to our strong Helper, for He has said, \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.\" Isaiah 27:5. Then why not come, why not drink of the living fountain of life? Why not be refreshed by partaking of the blessed heavenly waters? \n                                                                           457",
