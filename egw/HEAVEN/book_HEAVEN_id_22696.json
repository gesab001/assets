    "word": "Reason for Establishment of SDA Colleges--What is the object of establishing colleges among Seventh-day Adventists? It is to provide for our youth, so far as possible, the very best instruction--that which is free from error and in every respect pure from corrupting influences. There are in our land schools in abundance where education in the sciences may be carried to a high point, but they fail to reach the Bible standard of education. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The Lord must preside in our institutions of learning, or the object for which they were brought into existence, with great outlay of means, will fail of being accomplished.

We should meet a standard very much higher than do those who do not believe these solemn truths.--Letter 25a, 1890, pp. 4, 5. (To Brother Graham, July 14, 1890.)",
