    "word": "If you would have your homes sweet and inviting, make them bright with air and sunshine. . . . The precious sunlight may fade your carpets, but it will give a healthful color to the cheeks of your children. If you have God's presence, and possess earnest, loving hearts, a humble home, made bright with air and sunlight . . . will be to your family . . . a heaven below.",
