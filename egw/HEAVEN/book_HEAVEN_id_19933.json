    "word": "When the workers in the publishing house are educated to think of this great center as related to God, and under His supervision; when they realize that it is a channel through which light from heaven is to be communicated to the world, they will regard it with great respect and reverence. They will cherish the best thoughts and the noblest feelings, that in their work they may have the cooperation of the heavenly intelligences. As the workers realize that they are in the presence of angels, whose eyes are too pure to behold iniquity, a strong restraint will be placed on thoughts, words, and actions. They will be given moral strength, for the Lord says, \"Them that honor Me I will honor.\" 1 Samuel 2:30. Every worker will have a precious experience, and will possess faith and power that will rise superior to circumstances. All will be able to say, \"The Lord is in this place.\"--Testimony Vol. VII, pp. 191-193.",
