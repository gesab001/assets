    "word": "What saith our Redeemer? for we want to know what to do. The answer comes to walk in the light as it is unfolded to us.

He left His happy position in heaven, and laid off His royal robes, His crown, and dignity, and for our sakes became poor. He did not come to mingle with the great or to appear in splendor, but He associated Himself with the poor, to lift them up from their low estate; and for all this love He was despised and rejected of men.",
