    "word": "Medicine Bow Range--As we passed rapidly down the grade through the snowsheds and granite cuts into the great Laramie Plains we got a full view of the Diamond Peaks of the Medicine Bow Range. Their sharp-pointed summits reach heavenward, while their sides and the rugged hills around them are covered with timber. When the atmosphere is clear, the Snowy Range can be distinctly seen clothed in its robes of perpetual snow. A chilliness creeps over you as you look upon them, so cold, so cheerless, yet there is an indescribable grandeur about them. . . . \n\n\n                                     -375-",
