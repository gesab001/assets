    "word": "The Saviour was the greatest Teacher the world has ever known, and He revealed His wisdom not only in imparting for the benefit of the world the most precious light, but also in withholding that light. He who came down from heaven could have gathered to Himself large numbers to picture before them the celestial glories of the eternal world. But His work was not to astonish. He came to instruct the world and save it from ruin, that through His divine power men might be overcomers and become partakers of the divine nature, members of the royal family, children of the heavenly king, that they themselves might behold the glories of the eternal world to be given to the saints of the Most High God.",
