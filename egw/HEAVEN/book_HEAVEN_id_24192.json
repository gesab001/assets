    "word": "It takes a great deal of education to produce a man with capabilities sufficient for the work of God. Divine and human energies must be combined to make an experienced, capable worker of growth and education. God provides all that is necessary for the physical and mental growth of men and women. It is a great thing to become a man in God's sight, to be thus written in the books of heaven. This is an honor the meaning of which few realize. He who is a man in God's sight obeys the words, \"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not to thine own understanding\" [Proverbs 3:5]. \"In all thy ways, Acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths\" [Proverbs 3:6]. Man must walk with God in perfect harmony. How can two walk together except they be agreed?",
