    "word": "Here is the test of every man\u2019s profession. We cannot accord holiness to any man without bringing him to the measurement of God\u2019s only standard of holiness in heaven and in earth. If men feel no weight of the moral law, if they belittle and make light of God\u2019s precepts, if they break one of the least of these commandments, and teach men so, they shall be of no esteem in the sight of Heaven, and we may know that their claims are without foundation.",
