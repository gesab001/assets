    "word": "24, 25 (Revelation 20:12, 13). The Disposal of Sin.--Some men's sins are open beforehand, confessed in penitence, and forsaken, and they go beforehand to judgment. Pardon is written over against the names of these men. But other men's sins follow after, and are not put away by repentance and confession, and these sins will stand registered against them in the books of heaven (MS 1a, 1890).",
