    "word": "Chap. Sixty - Knowledge of and Obedience to the Laws of Life\n\n     Wonders of the Human Body.--We are God's workmanship, and His Word declares that we are \"fearfully and wonderfully made.\" He has prepared this living habitation for the mind; it is \"curiously wrought,\" a temple which the Lord Himself has fitted up for the indwelling of His Holy Spirit. The mind controls the whole man. All our actions, good or bad, have their source in the mind. It is the mind that worships God and allies us to heavenly beings. Yet many spend all their lives without becoming intelligent in regard to the casket [the human body] that contains this treasure.",
