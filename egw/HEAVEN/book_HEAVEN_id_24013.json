    "word": "Those who have lavished their affection on earthly treasures without regard to the heavenly riches will soon receive their reward. They will lose the earthly treasures, to obtain which they have sold their souls to Satan. They are without God and without hope in the world. By following the desires of their unconsecrated, unconverted natures, they have robbed themselves of an eternity of bliss. They have united with Satan, who has played the game of life for their souls.",
