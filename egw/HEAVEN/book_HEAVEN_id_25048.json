    "word": "Christ has a claim on all in this world. \"All things are delivered unto Me of My Father,\" He said. \"All things that the Father hath are mine.\" \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.\" All in heaven and in earth is at His service. The great gift of heavenly love was not to be shut up in the bosom of the Father. It was to Christ, to give to needy human beings.",
