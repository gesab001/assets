    "word": "Man Created With Sinless Moral Nature \n\n\n     In the councils of heaven God said, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. . . . So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him\" (Genesis 1:26, 27). The Lord created man's moral faculties and his physical powers. All was a sinless transcript of Himself. God endowed man with holy attributes, and placed him in a garden made expressly for him. Sin alone could ruin the beings created by the hand of the Almighty.--The Youth's Instructor, July 20, 1899.",
