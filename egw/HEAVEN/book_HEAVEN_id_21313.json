    "word": "Daniel refused to eat at the king's table, or to drink of the king's wine. Daniel 1:8. Why did he do this?--Because he knew that indulgence in wine-drinking and luxurious food would enfeeble the powers of mind and body. He desired to keep his mind in a condition to appreciate the inspired Word of God. Those who indulge in forbidden things work directly against their own interests and hopes. Selfish motives lead to self-indulgence, and animal appetites and passions bear sway, and dominate over mind and soul. Those who are thus controlled can not comprehend the truth of divine origin, or appreciate the value of heavenly things. The brain power is benumbed; the very foundation of the physical being is undermined. We have no right to destroy the habitation that God has given us; for we have been purchased at an infinite cost.",
