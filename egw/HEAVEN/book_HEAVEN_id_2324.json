    "word": "Unwholesome Bread \n\n     When I have been from home sometimes, I have known that the bread upon the table, and the food generally, would hurt me; but I would be obliged to eat a little to sustain life. It is a sin in the sight of heaven to have such food. I have suffered for want of proper food. For a dyspeptic stomach, you may place upon your tables fruits of different kinds, but not too many at one meal. In this way you may have a variety, and it will taste good, and after you have eaten your meals, you will feel well.-- Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, p. 373 (1869). \n\n\n   (148)",
