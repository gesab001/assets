    "word": "Brethren and sisters, has there not been among us enough of this work of criticising and accusing? Think you that you can carry this spirit with you to the heavenly courts ? You might far better have been asking the Lord to bless these men. You might far better have been doing the work of the Lord, than trying to discourage those who were endeavoring to carry out the educational principles that God has presented before them. Now let there be a thorough examination of your past lives. And wherever you see that you have in any way taken advantage of one of your brethren, repent of it, and make it right.",
