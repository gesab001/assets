    "word": "All heaven is interested in your salvation, and angels of God are waiting to do for you what they did for the early disciples on the day of Pentecost. Do your duty to your children, and for those who are ignorant of the truth. Carry out the teachings of the Word in your homes. You must stand in harmony with the God of heaven if you would lay hold of divine power. Humanity may reach divinity through faith in Christ. Then humanity can reach out to humanity, imparting the hope of the gospel to souls who are perishing out of Christ.--Ms. 75, 1909, pp. 4-6. (\"Labor for the Unconverted,\" October 18, 1909.)",
