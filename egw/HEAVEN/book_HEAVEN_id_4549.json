    "word": "Intemperance in study is a species of intoxication, and those who indulge in it, like the drunkard, wander from safe paths, and stumble and fall in the darkness. The Lord would have every student bear in mind that the eye must be kept single to the glory of God. They are not to exhaust and waste their physical and mental powers in seeking to acquire all possible knowledge of the sciences; but every individual is to preserve the freshness and vigor of all his powers to engage in the work which the Lord has appointed him in helping souls to find the path of righteousness. All must preserve the vigor of their lives, their soul-energy and ambitions, and prepare to leave their studies in school, and take up the more practical studies in the sphere of activity, where angels cooperate with them. The intelligences of heaven will work through the human agents. The command of heaven is to do, work,--do something which will reflect glory to God by being a benefit to our fellow men who are ready to perish.",
