    "word": "That perfection of character which the Lord requires is the fitting up of the whole being as a temple for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

All parts must work in perfect harmony, or the service will be deficient. It is thus that man is qualified to cooperate with God in representing Christ to the world. Thus God desires to prepare a people to stand before Him pure and holy, that He may introduce them into the society of heavenly angels.",
