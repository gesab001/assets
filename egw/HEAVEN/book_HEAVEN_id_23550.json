    "word": "In regard to the Sunday question, we cannot handle it as a Conference. The circumstances that will arise will determine such questions. The Lord gives us light if we will seek for it by humble prayer. Wisdom and knowledge from heaven will come as to just when, how, and where we should work, when this light is needed. I am afraid of the many resolutions framed to come before the Conference, and acted upon without special seeking of the Lord. There have been resolutions brought into the Conference and without due consideration acted upon and made law, and many will pay no regard to these laws for they were found to be a binding about of our work and binding of false principles upon the conferences.",
