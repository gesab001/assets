    "word": "MR No. 693 - To Overcome as Christ Overcame\n\n     John pointed the people to the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world. He said, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). There is a great deal in that \"taketh away.\" The question is, shall we keep on sinning as though it were an impossibility for us to overcome? How are we to overcome? As Christ overcame. He prayed to His heavenly Father; we can do the same, and that is the only way. Then, we are to overcome something, for it is stated that those who shall see Him in His beauty shall be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.",
