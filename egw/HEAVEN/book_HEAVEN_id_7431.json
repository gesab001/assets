    "word": "True religion is embodied in the Word of God, and consists in being under the guidance of the Holy One in thought, word, and deed. He who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life takes the humble, earnest, wholehearted seeker, and says, Follow Me. He leads him the narrow way to holiness and heaven. . . . And all who decide to follow the Lord fully will be led in the royal path (Review and Herald, Mar. 29, 1906). \n                                                                           107",
