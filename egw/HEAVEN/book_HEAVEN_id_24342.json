    "word": "The question is, Has every man taken up his cross and followed Christ? If he has, this settles the question of his discipleship. \"If any man will be My disciple let him deny (not indulge and pet) himself, and take up his cross and follow Me\" [See Matthew 16:24]. This is not merely a Christian duty, but the certain evidence of discipleship--the Christian duty. It is the one thing, the great test of character, the proof of discipleship, and our heirship to heaven.",
