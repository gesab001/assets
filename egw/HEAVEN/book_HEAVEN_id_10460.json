    "word": "GOD ACCEPTS THE PRAYER OF FAITH.\u2014The humble, intelligent prayer of faith, that comes from unfeigned lips, is wholly acceptable to God. It is the heart-felt prayer that is heard in heaven and rewarded by an answer on earth. \u201cBut to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.\u201d\u201cFor thus saith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and a humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite\n56\nones.\u201d\u201cThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.\u201d(Signs of the Times, December 3, 1896.)",
