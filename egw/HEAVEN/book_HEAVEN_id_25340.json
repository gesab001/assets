    "word": "I am pained as I see so much prejudice and Phariseeism. O that our ministering brethren would broaden, and not be so narrow and shortsighted. Many souls will come from other denominational churches, and at the eleventh hour will obey all the truth, because they have not set themselves in array against heaven's light, but lived up to all the light they had: while those who have had great light, large privileges and opportunities, and have failed to live in the light and walk in the light, will drop out by the way. Their light will shine less and less until their lamps will go out, for the want of the oil of grace in their vessels with their lamps.",
