    "word": "Chapter 16 \n\n     25 (Ephesians 3:9-11; Colossians 1:26, 27; see EGW on 2 Corinthians 12:1-4). The Eternal Purposes of God.--God had a knowledge of the events of the future, even before the creation of the world. He did not make His purposes to fit circumstances, but He allowed matters to develop and work out. He did not work to bring about a certain condition of things, but He knew that such a condition would exist. The plan that should be carried out upon the defection of any of the high intelligences of heaven--this is the secret, the mystery which has been hid from ages. And an offering was prepared in the eternal purposes to do the very work which God has done for fallen humanity (ST March 25, 1897).",
