    "word": "Workers From All Classes \n     The truth is to go forth as a lamp that burneth. The Lord will call men of high and low degree to do His bidding. The prophet Daniel was a man of royal birth and noble heritage. Not many mighty, not many noble, are called. Yet we know that the Lord has chosen men from the highest ranks. On them the light of heaven has shone, and they have adorned by their practice the truth of Jehovah. Isaiah and Daniel were of royal birth. David was called from the sheepfold to the throne of Israel; Amos was a herdsman; Zechariah, a captive from Babylon; Elisha, a plowman. So the Lord calls men from all ranks to enter His service. --Letter 96, 1901",
