    "word": "There is a work to be done, and let every hand as well as heart be engaged to do the work. When men and women go to the Lord Jesus Christ for their individual selves, and are not educated to look to and trust in man, there will be fewer and fewer committee meetings; for all will be instructed of God. Men and women will understand thoroughly their personal responsibilities and the important results of personal effort. Nothing in the way of barriers will be erected to keep men from their fellow men. The work of saving souls will be the first great work. The individual believer reaches the individual sinner. We shall all kindle our tapers from the \n\n\n                      - 30 - \n\ndivine altar. All have a lamp, and that lamp filled with the golden oil emptied from the heavenly witnesses that stand before the throne of God, will shed the most precious, strong, pure, clear rays of light on the sinner's pathway. The word is given from the throne of God. \"Every man to his work, each to do his best.\"",
