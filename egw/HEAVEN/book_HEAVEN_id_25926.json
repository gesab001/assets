    "word": "But Elijah forgot God and fled. He went to Beersheba, and going a day's journey into the wilderness, sat down under a juniper tree. \"And he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, an angel from Heaven touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. And he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruise of water beside his head. And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.\"",
