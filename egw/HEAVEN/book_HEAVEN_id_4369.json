    "word": "Jesus rides forth as a mighty conqueror. Not now a \"man of sorrows,\" to drink the bitter cup of shame and woe, He comes, victor in heaven and earth, to judge the living and the dead. \"Faithful and True,\" \"in righteousness he doth judge and make war.\" And \"the armies which were in heaven followed him.\" Revelation 19:11, 14. With anthems of celestial melody the holy angels, a vast, unnumbered throng, attend Him on His way. The firmament seems filled with radiant forms--\"ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.\" No human pen can portray the scene; no mortal mind is adequate to conceive its splendor. \"His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light.\" Habakkuk 3:3, 4. As the living cloud comes still nearer, every eye beholds the Prince of life. No crown of thorns now mars that sacred head, but a diadem of glory rests on His holy brow. His countenance outshines the dazzling brightness of the noonday sun. \"And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.\" Revelation 19:16.",
