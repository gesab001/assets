    "word": "MR No. 916 - Make Christ Your Constant Counsellor\n\n     We received your letter last night and we were very glad to hear from you. We feel sorry to hear that you feel lonely. We were not sorry to learn that our absence is felt. This would be only natural. We hope, my son, that you will not depend upon any one or any surroundings for happiness. Look aloft, my boy, look aloft. There is a heaven full of consolation for those who seek it. You have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He pleads your cause before His Father. He has invited you to come to Him and cast all your care upon Him.",
