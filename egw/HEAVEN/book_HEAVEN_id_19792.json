A man may lavish all the treasures of his learning, he may exhaust the moral energies of his nature, and yet accomplish nothing, because he himself has not received the golden oil \n\n\n                    - 25 - \n\nfrom the heavenly messengers: therefore it cannot flow forth from him, imparting spiritual life to the needy. The tidings of of joy and hope must come from heaven. Learn, O learn of Jesus what it means to abide in Christ.",
