    "word": "I think of the meditation of Christ and the promise, \"I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you\" (John 14:18).

We shall have apostasies; we expect them. \"They will go out from us, because they were not of us\" [cf: 1 John 2:19]. \"Every plant, which My heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up\" (Matthew 15:13).",
