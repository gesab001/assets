He urged Christ to show His confidence in the preserving care of His Father by casting Himself down from the temple. In Satan's first temptation upon the point of appetite, he had tried to insinuate doubts in regard to God's love and care for Christ as His Son, by presenting His surroundings and His hunger as evidence that He was not in favor with God.
