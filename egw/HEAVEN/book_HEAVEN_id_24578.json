    "word": "Well then, why talk darkness? Why talk rebelliousness? Why not lift yourself up in the holier, purer atmosphere? Why talk all the time that you don't feel as you want to feel? Take hold of Jesus Christ. As you feel after His hand, He takes that hand. He puts it in His; He lifts you up. Well then, be lifted up. Don't let your body, like the body of death, [remain] in darkness, [so] that nothing can lift it. Come where the light is, and let it reveal its glory--glorious beams that come from Jesus Christ through you. Talk hope; talk courage. Cease your faultfinding, and let us talk of heaven and heavenly things.",
