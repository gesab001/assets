    "word": "God wants you to receive the wisdom that He has for you. He wants you to be Bible students and Bible believers, living in obedience to the words, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, \n\n\n                                       -339- \n\nand with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself\" [Luke 10:27]. Then he can bestow on you the power of His truth. Then He can mold and fashion you after the divine similitude. Living in conformity to Christ's will, you will be changed into His likeness. You will grow up into Him, and at last the pearly gates of the holy city will for you swing back on their glittering hinges, and you will enter to hear the words, \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" [Revelation 22:14]. In your hands will be placed a golden harp, and touching its strings, you will join with the redeemed host in filling all heaven with songs of praise to God and His Son.",
