    "word": "\"I was today to write upon Christ walking on the sea and \n     stilling the tempest. Oh, how this scene was impressed upon my \n     mind. Brother Chittendon says Sister White looks just happy, but \n     she does not say a word to any one. I was filled with awe with my \n     own thoughts. Everything seemed so grand in that ocean, the waves \n     running so high. The majesty of God and His works occupied my \n     thoughts. He holds the winds in His hand, He controls the waters. \n     Finite beings mere specks upon the broad deep waters of the Pacific \n     were we in the sight of God, yet angels of heaven were sent from \n     His excellent glory to guard that little sailboat that was \n     careening over the waves. Oh the wonderful works of God! So much \n     above our comprehension! He at one glance beholds the highest \n     heavens and the midst of the sea.",
