    "word": "With the trusting faith of a little child, we are to come to our heavenly Father, telling Him of all our needs. He is always ready to pardon and help. The supply of divine wisdom is inexhaustible, and the Lord encourages us to draw largely from it. The longing that we should have for spiritual blessings is described in the words, \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.\" We need a deeper soul-hunger for the rich gifts that heaven has to bestow.",
