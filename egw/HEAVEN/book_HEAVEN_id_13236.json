    "word": "The intelligent, conscientious care of our bodies is due to our Heavenly Father, who \"so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" We are individually the property of Christ, his purchased possession. It is required of each one of us to preserve our health and strength by the practise of temperance in all things. The appetites and passions must be controlled, that through them we shall not weaken or defile God's human temple.",
