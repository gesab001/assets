    "word": "Take heed, my brother, to the words of the One who is the light of the world: \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" The world is full of hurry and disappointment. The words are addressed to you, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" The words in favor of truth, spoken with the assurance that comes from the possession of a right purpose, and in cheerful hope, from a pure heart, will make the angels rejoice. When in the day of final awards, the reward is given to each as his works have been, it is your privilege to have redeemed souls whom you have been the means of helping, come to you and say, \"You lifted me out of discouragement.\" And the Master \n\n\n                                   -341- \n\nwill say to you, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant, . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"",
