    "word": "Angels Waiting to Co-operate with Us. \n\n     All heaven is in activity, and the angels of God are waiting to cooperate with the human agent who will devise plans whereby souls for whom Christ died may hear the glad tidings of salvation. Every soul has an influence for good or evil. If the soul is sanctified to the service of God, and devoted to the work of Christ, the influence will be to gather with Christ. God depends upon the church for the forwarding of His work, and He expects that His professed followers will do their duty as intelligent beings. There is great need that every trained mind, every disciplined intellect, every jot of ability, shall be brought to the work of saving souls. There will be no idler, no slothful one who neglects the work of the Lord, found inside of the kingdom of heaven.",
