    "word": "The heavenly universe looks upon an absence of meekness and lowliness of heart. The self-exaltation, the feeling of swelling importance, makes the human agent so large in his own estimation that he feels that he has no need of a Saviour, no need to wear Christ's yoke. But the invitation to each soul is, \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:29).",
