    "word": "We must expect to be assailed by the powers of darkness, but if we successfully resist then there will be rejoicing in heaven. The souls of men are valued by the heavenly host. They know of the great sacrifice that has been made for man. When Satan sees a soul struggling for light, then he doubles his energies to bring him back under his banner. Satan is playing the game of life. I feel distressed when I realize the trials that will meet those who desire life; but these things will come, and the question is, Who will be on the Lord's side? It will be those who go to the Standard for their counsel.",
