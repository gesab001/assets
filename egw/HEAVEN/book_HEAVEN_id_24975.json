    "word": "We have a God who is our Ruler. How can the great Governor of the world behold with any satisfaction these wicked cities full of violence and every type and stripe of crime? Our Creator has given in His Word a law to be obeyed. No one should lightly regard this law. Our courts of justice are perverted, and in the heavenly courts are condemned. Even eating, drinking, and dressing are carried to such excess as to become crimes. They are specified as last-day signs by our world's Redeemer, who gave His life a sacrifice to save the fallen race.",
