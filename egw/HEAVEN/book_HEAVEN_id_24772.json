    "word": "-47- \n\n     God wants us to agonize with Him that His power may unite with our efforts, that we may bring those into the truth who shall be an honor to His cause. However poor they may be, if they have root in themselves, they can have an influence upon others. There are fields where there are souls who will respond to the truth, who will be shining lights. I have felt that it was best for us to pray and have living faith that God would direct us as to the manner of our labors. \"It is not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord.\" It is a living connection with heaven which brings the light and power by which we can bring souls to Christ.",
