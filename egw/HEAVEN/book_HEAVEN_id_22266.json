    "word": "My heart is often sad, and often I spend the greater part of the night in prayer. I am thankful that the Lord is so kind and helpful to me. I desire to praise Him with heart and soul and voice. . . . Pain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. In the home of the redeemed there will be no tears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning. The inhabitants shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. One rich tide of happiness will flow and deepen as eternity rolls on. Think of this; tell it to the children of suffering and sorrow, and bid them rejoice in hope.",
