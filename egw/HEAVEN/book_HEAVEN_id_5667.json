    "word": "That the expression, \u201cbottomless pit,\u201d represents the earth in a state of confusion and darkness, is evident from other scriptures. Concerning the condition of the earth \u201cin the beginning,\u201d the Bible record says that it \u201cwas without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.\u201d [GENESIS 1:2; THE WORD HERE TRANSLATED \u201cDEEP\u201d IS THE SAME THAT IN REVELATION 20:1-3 IS RENDERED \u201cBOTTOMLESS PIT.\"] \n659\nProphecy teaches that it will be brought back, partially, at least, to this condition. Looking forward to the great day of God, the prophet Jeremiah declares: \u201cI beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down.\u201d [Jeremiah 4:23-27.]",
