    "word": "Carefulness in Our Speech--Our speech should be without deception. No guile must be found in our lips, no impurity allowed in our hearts, no unkindliness in our speech or in our attitude toward one another. Learn the language of Canaan here, which will be in harmony with the language of heaven. In this commencement of the new year, cultivate grace and love and a deep interest in spiritual things. Shall we not have the love of God burning upon the altar of our hearts? And shall not our thanksgiving go forth from unfeigned lips?--Ms 171, 1903, p. 4. (Diary, Jan. 18, 1903.)",
