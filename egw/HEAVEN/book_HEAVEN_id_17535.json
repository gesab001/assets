    "word": "With your children around you, bow before the Father in heaven. Ask Him for help to guard the trust He has given you. Let your petitions be short and earnest. Say, \"Heavenly Father, I want my children to be saved. Grant me the aid of Thy Spirit that I may so train them that they may be counted worthy to inherit eternal life.\" Train your children to offer their simple words of prayer. Tell them that God delights to have them call upon Him.",
