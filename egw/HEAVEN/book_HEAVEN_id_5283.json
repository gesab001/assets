    "word": "Let us go to the word of God for guidance. Let us seek for a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" We have had enough of human methods. A mind trained only in worldly science will fail to understand the things of God; but the same mind, converted and sanctified, will see the divine power in the Word. Only the mind and heart cleansed by the sanctification of the Spirit can discern heavenly things.",
