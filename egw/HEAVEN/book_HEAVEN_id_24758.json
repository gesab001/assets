    "word": "Now, when you meet together in your little churches where you are, then remember these words that have been spoken to you this morning, and let every one feel an earnestness to bring all the life and vivacity into that meeting that it is possible for him to bring. Pray to your heavenly Father as though you expected that He would hear you. Offer your testimonies as though you knew the God of heaven would listen and that they would be written down in the books of heaven. When you do this, your own souls will be kept alive; you will be strong in His strength, mighty in His power. You will see the work of God in your midst, and others will be added to your number to unite with you.--Ms 10, 1886 (MR 900. 66). \n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nEntire Ms.",
