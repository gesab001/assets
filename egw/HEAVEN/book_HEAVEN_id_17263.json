    "word": "In Africa as well as in America and Australia men have been quarried out of the world, not to be left as rough stones, but to be taken into the workshop of God, and placed under the axe and hammer and chisel of gospel truth, till all the roughness disappears, and they are made ready for the heavenly polishing. The roughness has not yet been cut away. Many are not yet subdued by the Spirit of God. Because of this, the work in Africa and America and other parts of the Lord's vineyard has not advanced as it should.",
