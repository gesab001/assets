    "word": "\"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your \n Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" \n Matthew 5:48. \n\n\n     The word \"therefore\" implies a conclusion, an inference from what has gone before. Jesus has been describing to His hearers the unfailing mercy and love of God, and He bids them therefore to be perfect. Because your heavenly Father \"is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil\" (Luke 6:35), because He has stooped to lift you up, therefore, said Jesus, you may become like Him in character, and stand without fault in the presence of men and angels.",
