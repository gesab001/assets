    "word": "The gospel is associated with light and life. If there were no sunlight, all vegetation would perish, and human life could not exist. All animal life would die. We are all to consider that there is to be no extravagance in any line. . . . We are preparing for the future, immortal life in the kingdom of heaven. We expect to do our work in the light and in the power of the great, mighty Healer. All are to act the self-sacrificing part. Every one of us is to learn of Christ. \"Learn of me,\" He says; \"for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:29). . . .",
