    "word": "At this point another symbol is introduced. Says the prophet, \u201cI beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb.\u201d [Revelation 13:11.] Both the appearance of this beast and the manner of its rise indicate that the nation which it represents is unlike those presented under \n440\nthe preceding symbols. The great kingdoms that have ruled the world were presented to the prophet Daniel as beasts of prey, rising when the \u201cfour winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.\u201d [Daniel 7:2.] In Revelation 17, an angel explained that waters represent \u201cpeoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.\u201d [Revelation 17:15.] Winds are a symbol of strife. The four winds of heaven striving upon the great sea, represent the terrible scenes of conquest and revolution by which kingdoms have attained to power.",
