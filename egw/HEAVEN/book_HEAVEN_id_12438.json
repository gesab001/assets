    "word": "Those who think they can obtain a knowledge of God aside from His Representative, whom the Word declares is \"the express image of his person,\" will need to become fools in their own estimation before they can be wise. It is impossible to gain a perfect knowledge of God from nature alone; for nature itself is imperfect. In its imperfection it cannot represent God, it cannot reveal the character of God in its moral perfection. But Christ came as a personal Saviour to the world. He represented a personal God. As a personal Saviour, He ascended on high; and He will come again as He ascended to heaven--a personal Saviour. He is the express image of the Father's person. \"In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily\" (RH Nov. 8, 1898).",
