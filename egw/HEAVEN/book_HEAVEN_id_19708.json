In this wide missionary field there is a great deal to be done in advancing the cause and work of the Master, and with the great want of means and of workers, we know not how it can be done. We must humble our hearts before God, and offer up sincere, fervent prayer that the Lord, who is rich in resources, will open our way. \"The gold and silver is mine,\" saith the Lord, \"and the cattle upon a thousand hills.\" The life of Christ, the Lord of glory, is our example. He came from heaven, where all was riches and splendor; but he laid aside his royal crown, his royal robe, and clothed his divinity with humanity. Why?--That he might meet men where they were. He did not rank himself with the wealthy, the lordly of earth. The mission of Christ was to reach the very poor of earth. He himself worked from his earliest years as the son of a carpenter. Self-denial, did he not know its meaning? The riches and glory of heaven were his own, but for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might become rich. The very foundation of his mission was self-denial, self-sacrifice. The world was his, he made it; yet in a world of his own \n\n\n                         - 4 - \n\ncreating, the Son of man had not where to lay his head. He said, \"The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\"",
