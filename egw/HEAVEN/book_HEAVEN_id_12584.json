    "word": "All truth is to be received as the life of Jesus. Truth cleanses us from all impurity, and prepares the soul for Christ's presence. Christ is formed within, the hope of glory (MS 103, 1902).  {7BC 957.10}  \n     7, 11, 17, 29 (ch. 3:6, 13, 22). Ears Closed to Folly and Nonsense.--\"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\" If you \"hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches,\" and meditate upon the instruction given to them, your ears will be closed to the folly and nonsense which surround you. You will neither hear and repeat these things, nor will you ever hanker after them. When Christ satisfies the soul hunger, these trivialities are to you distasteful and disgusting. You have no desire to feast upon them, but choose instead the bread of heaven (MS 92, 1901). \n                                                                           958\n {7BC 957.11} \n     9. The Synagogue of Satan.--Christ speaks of the church over which Satan presides as the synagogue of Satan. Its members are the children of disobedience. They are those who choose to sin, who labor to make void the holy law of God. It is Satan's work to mingle evil with good, and to remove the distinction between good and evil. Christ would have a church that labors to separate the evil from the good, whose members will not willingly tolerate wrong-doing, but will expel it from the heart and life (RH Dec. 4, 1900).",
