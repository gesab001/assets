    "word": "A Mistake to be Deplored. \n\n     There are and ever will be persons who do not move wisely, who will, if words of doubt or unbelief are spoken, throw off conviction and choose to follow their own will; and because of their deficiencies Christ has been reproached. Poor finite mortals have judged the rich and precious outpouring of the Spirit, and passed sentence upon it, as the Jews passed sentence upon the work of Christ. Let it be understood in every institution in America that it is not commissioned to you to direct the work of the Holy Spirit, and tell how it shall represent itself. You have been guilty of doing this. May the Lord forgive you, is my prayer. Instead of being repressed and driven back, as it has been, the Holy Spirit should be welcomed, and its presence encouraged. When you sanctify yourself through obedience to the word, the Holy Spirit will give you glimpses of heavenly things. When you seek God with humiliation and earnestness, the words which you have spoken in freezing accents will burn in your hearts; the truth will not then languish upon your tongues. \n\n\n                      - 34 -",
