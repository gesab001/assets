    "word": "The Lord will heal those who believe, but He has given natural blessings for the benefit of the afflicted, and He would have these used. God could have healed Hezekiah with a word. But He heard Hezekiah's prayer, and gave directions that a bunch of figs be placed upon the diseased parts. This was done, and Hezekiah recovered. But his recovery was not instantaneous. He had not the same faith that the afflicted woman had. We need to exercise faith. To practice the use of drug medication does not harmonize with faith. Appealing to worldly physicians is dishonoring to God. Those who come to God in faith must co-operate with Him in accepting and using His heaven-sent remedies,--water, sunlight, and plenty of air.",
