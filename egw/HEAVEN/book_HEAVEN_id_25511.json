    "word": "Chap. 128 - Battle Creek, Mich., Tuesday, April 4, 1893.\n\nAddress to the Church.\n-\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\n-\n     Christ, the true witness, addresses the church at Ephesus, saying, \"I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\" What effect have these words had upon the church? Have the professed people of God understood the import of the words, \"I will come unto thee quickly [when you are at ease, careless, filled with spiritual negligence], and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\" When warnings come no more to the people of God, when tender admonitions from the Spirit of God are silent, when the candle of heavenly illumination shines no longer upon their pathway, they will be left to kindle their own fire, and to walk in the sparks of their own kindling.",
