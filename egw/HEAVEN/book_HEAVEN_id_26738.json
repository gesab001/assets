    "word": "\"Who among you,\" said the heavenly Messenger, \"have tried to come into connection with the colored schools, that they might become acquainted with the teachers? How many have you converted to obedience to the truth?\" The Lord is not pleased with the young men and the middle aged men who have felt no burden for the souls who are right around them. God desires that His servants shall explain the truths of his word in the darkest as well as in the most enlightened places. Consecration to God and prayer, earnest prayer, must be blended with the work.",
