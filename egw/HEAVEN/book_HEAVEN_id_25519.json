He represents himself as personally affected with all that concerns them. He reproved the errors and actions of the Jews with the indignant sensibility of one who felt himself personally misrepresented, accused, and dishonored. Every wrong done to his followers, or to the weakest of humanity, is regarded by him with intense interest. After presenting his relation to his people in various lights, he finally declares that in the great day he will judge of every action as if it had been done unto himself. His sympathy with his people is without a parallel. He will not simply remain a spectator, indifferent to what his people may suffer, but identifies himself with their interests and sorrows. If his people are wronged, maligned, treated with contempt, their sufferings are registered in the books of heaven as done unto him.",
