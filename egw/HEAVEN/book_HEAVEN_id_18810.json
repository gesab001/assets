    "word": "Christ came to establish reforms, and to draw all men unto Him. His will is to be done in earth as it is in heaven. When you have determined what reforms need to be carried out, labor with persevering, fearless courage to that end. Do not expect to carry out the pure, uplifting principles of true reform without meeting opposition. God's Word plainly teaches that all who will live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution from those who seek to tear down what God declares to be truth and righteousness. . . .",
