    "word": "I am told that before finishing the life of Christ I ought to visit Jerusalem, the holy land. What made it holy? The Majesty of heaven clothed His divinity with humanity, and dwelt upon our earth. He was despised and rejected of men; in Jerusalem He was crucified by wicked hands. I have not the slightest inclination to visit Jerusalem, to see where it is thought probable that Jesus trod, where He may have labored, and where He may have been crucified. The means which might be expended thus I would prefer to treasure, that I may point souls to the Saviour risen from Joseph's tomb, and proclaiming, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" I can trace His footprints in the sure word of prophecy, and can obtain a better idea of His works and of His ways, than I could by visiting Jerusalem, defiled with unholy feet and unholy deeds. I could not expend money to visit these places when the living interests of Christ's kingdom are to be presented to the people. We are to teach the word of God, and to be doers of that word, which is represented as building upon the rock; the structure thus built will withstand the storm and the tempest, because it is founded on the eternal Rock. \n                                                                           138",
