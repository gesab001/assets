    "word": "In order to be accounted guiltless before God, we must be as faithful in our time in following and obeying our light, as they were faithful in following and obeying the light that shone upon them. Of every individual member of His church, our heavenly Father requires faith and fruits according to the grace and light given. God cannot accept less. Every soul should place himself where the light will shine upon him. He should treasure every ray, that he may brighten and bless the souls of others with the Heaven-sent radiance.--Review and Herald, April 25, 1893.",
