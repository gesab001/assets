    "word": "There is scarcely an operation of nature but we will find reference made to it in the Word of God. The Word declares, \"He maketh His sun to rise\" (Matthew 5:45), \"He maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains.\" (Psalm 147:8.) \"He giveth snow like wool; He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes\" (verse 16). \"When he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens. . . . He maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures\" (Jeremiah 10:13).",
