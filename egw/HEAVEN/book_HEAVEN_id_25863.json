They are to be instructed by precept and example in the way of the truth. \"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say unto you, That in heaven, their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.\" \n\n\n                                   - 28 -",
