    "word": "42 (Matthew 26:42; Mark 14:36; see EGW on Romans 8:11). Father Is Beside Every Struggling Soul.--Christ conquered by divine strength, and so must every tempted soul overcome. God was with Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, and by the experience of Christ we are to learn to trust our heavenly Father; at all times and in all places we are to believe that He is tender, true, and faithful, able to keep that which is committed to His care. In the agonizing struggle of Christ, our Substitute and Surety, the Father was beside His son, and He is beside every soul that struggles with discouragement and difficulty (Letter 106, 1896).",
