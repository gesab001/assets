    "word": "To me, this experience was marked evidence of divine help. I am so grateful to my heavenly Father for this special miracle of His power, which gave me no chance for any doubt.

I was so very weak; but I praise the Lord for His goodness, and for evidence of His special power upon me in such a way that I could not entertain a doubt but that He had a message for me to bear to the people. I was very sick in the afternoon, and restless during the night; but Sunday I was able to sit up in bed, and trace some of the lines that I am sending to you.",
