    "word": "Bro. McLearn and Wm. Gage in their testimonies worked directly against the Spirit of God. They did not seem to understand that Heaven's light was shining in upon them to call them as a people to repentance. They treated the warnings of the Spirit of God as a matter of indifference,--as though that voice were human in place of divine. What there was to make any demonstration of on their part they \n                                                                           2\ncould not see. If they had done wrong, why dwell upon it so much? Just go on; let it all drop, and say as little about it as possible. This is the very thing the enemy of souls wants them to do; and Bro. McLearn, here in this peril of the church, while God is seeking to arouse them, has revealed his true spirit, and that he was not a safe man to counsel and advise the church in a crisis. God is calling them to repentance, and do Bro. McLearn and Wm. Gage work in harmony with the Spirit of God? Are these men confessing their own sins, acknowledging their departure from God, which has brought calamity upon the church and the frown of God? Smooth words and fair speeches are uttered to mislead those who would come to the light. Instead of these men falling upon the Rock and being broken, they are using their inventive powers to make it appear that they were not deserving of reproof, that their course had been altogether different than the Spirit of the Lord had represented. Will they take the Testimonies home and act upon them? No; they have not done it, and do not intend to do it. A spirit of vindication is aroused in them rather than of humiliation and confession.",
