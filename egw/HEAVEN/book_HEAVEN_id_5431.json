    "word": "At the time of Christ's first advent, the priests and scribes of the holy city, to whom were intrusted the oracles of God, might have discerned the signs of the times, and proclaimed the coming of the Promised One. The prophecy of Micah designated his birthplace; [Micah 5:2.] Daniel specified the time of his advent. [Daniel 9:25.] God had committed these prophecies to the Jewish leaders; they were without excuse if they did not know and declare to the people that the Messiah's coming was at hand. Their ignorance was the result of sinful neglect. The Jews were building monuments for the slain prophets of God, while by their deference to the great men of earth they were paying homage to the servants of Satan. Absorbed \n313\nin their ambitious strife for place and power among men, they lost sight of the divine honors proffered them by the King of Heaven.",
