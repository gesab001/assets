    "word": "In His mercy and grace God desires to let you see your wrongs, that you may repent and become reconverted. You may become kind and thoughtful, and reveal to others that your hearts are made white in the blood of the Lamb. Let not another blot of sin come upon your soul. The Father calls you to live the life of Christ, to put away the passionate temper, and henceforth to walk in meekness and lowliness of mind. He desires that you and Sister Sheafe shall become a son and daughter in the heavenly family. \n\n\n                                 -162-",
