    "word": "Shepherds of the flock, when do you manifest such love as dwelt in the bosom of Christ? Oh, where is the tenderness of Christ? You and your associates should humble your hearts before God and become as little children. \"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" You are all very near and dear to my heart, but remember that in every trial you must hold firmly to the hand that was pierced for you. Often has the hand of God been stretched out to save you from peril, but when men have spoken words that were not inspired by the Spirit of God, you have felt disheartened. When unwise movements have been made in reference to you, my son, you have sometimes dropped the hand, the dear loving hand that was held out to save you, and you have grieved the heart of Jesus. This is why I write and caution you not to trust in men, or to make flesh your arm. You must make God alone your trust. Look unto Him for guidance.",
