    "word": "Learning to Work as He Worked \n\n     In all our sanitariums, God is to be acknowledged as the Master Workman. By becoming familiar with His life, the physicians and helpers are to learn how to work as He worked. He was the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory. But, clothed with the garb of humanity, He took His place at the head of the fallen race. He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. He assumed human nature to make it possible for man to be a partaker of the divine nature.",
