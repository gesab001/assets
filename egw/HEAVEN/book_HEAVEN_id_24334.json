    "word": "Christ is soon to come, and no soul should stand in a position where he will say in word or action, \"My Lord delayeth His coming.\" Christ's true followers will represent Him in character. They turn aside from worldly policy and are being trained for everyday service in the cause of God. In active service they find peace and hope, efficiency and power. They are conscious that they are breathing the breath of heaven, the only atmosphere in which the soul can live. By obedience they are made partakers of the divine nature. The doing of the living principles of the law of God makes them one with Christ. And He has pledged Himself \n\n\n                                     -348- \n\nto raise them up at the last day. Because He lives they will live also. He will raise them up as a part of Himself.",
