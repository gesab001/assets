    "word": "The very same Jesus, who, veiled in the cloudy pillar, led the Hebrew hosts, is our leader. He who gave wise and righteous and good laws to Israel has spoken to us as verily as to them. Our prosperity and happiness depend upon our unwavering obedience to the law of God. Finite wisdom could not improve one precept of that holy law. Not one of those ten precepts can be broken without disloyalty to the God of heaven. To keep every jot and tittle of the law is essential for our own happiness, and for the happiness of all connected with us. \u201cGreat peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.\u201d Yet finite creatures will present to the people this holy, just, and good law as a yoke of bondage\u2014a yoke which they cannot bear! It is the transgressor that can see no beauty in the law of God.",
