    "word": "The vineyard is the Lord's; the work in every part is His, and He would have you so labor that your physical, mental, and moral powers shall be preserved. Bear in mind that you are cooperating with heavenly agencies. Do not allow the enemy to have the least partnership in the firm. Receive your orders from God, and in no wise be discouraged because you can only do the work of a finite agent.",
