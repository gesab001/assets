    "word": "Those who do not walk by the rule laid down in the Word of God should be faithfully admonished, and if they fail to reform, should be deprived of their license or credentials. Otherwise the conference that has sanctioned the labors of these men will share their guilt. It is a mercy to the unfaithful laborer himself to remove him from his position, for the rebuke of God is upon him. It is a duty enjoined by Heaven that souls may not be contaminated by the unholy spiritual atmosphere that surrounds him.",
