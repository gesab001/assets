    "word": "May 13, 1892. Today the mail for America closed. It has been a trying day for us all, but we managed to get the letters off in time. I sent about fifty pages of letters away. After the mail had gone, Sister Tay, Marian, and I rode out. The weather was mild and pleasant and we enjoyed the drive. The sunset was very fine. The clouds were golden, and it looked as if the gates of heaven were ajar.",
