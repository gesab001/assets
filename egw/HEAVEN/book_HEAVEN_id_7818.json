    "word": "The white robe of innocence was worn by our first parents when they were placed by God in holy Eden. . . . But when sin entered, they severed their connection with God, and the light that had encircled them departed. . . . Nothing can man devise to supply the place of his lost robe of innocence. . . . Only the covering which Christ Himself has provided can make us meet to appear in God's presence. This covering, the robe of His own righteousness, Christ will put upon every repenting, believing soul. . . . This robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has in it not one thread of human devising. Christ in His humanity wrought out a perfect character, and this character He offers to impart to us. \"All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.\" Isaiah 64:6. Everything that we of ourselves can do is defiled by sin. But the Son of God \"was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.\" 1 John 3:5. . . .",
