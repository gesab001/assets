Such seed, once sown, is difficult to eradicate. It requires time and labor and distress of soul to adjust things, and bring in a state of harmony and peace. All heaven is laboring for the unity of the church, and the professed followers of Christ are working at cross-purposes with God, because they will not heed His instruction, but will bring in dissension. . . .",
