    "word": "By their indifference many church members have grieved the Holy Spirit of God. In Christ's stead they are to beseech others to become reconciled to God. Heavenly agencies stand ready to cooperate with those who engage in the work of the Lord. The Holy Spirit is waiting to unite in sympathy with every true believer, and to make him a laborer together with God. Let no means be neglected that will advance the work to be done. There must be no self-exaltation, and far more prayer.",
