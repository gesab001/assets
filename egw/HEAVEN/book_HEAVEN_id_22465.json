    "word": "Let no one take up the work of the Lord boastingly. Let everyone keep before him the perfection of Christ's work. He always worked to a purpose. If you would do His work, you must crucify self. Self-importance is a very poor element to be brought into the work of God. Let your words be full of meaning, full of love to Christ, and let your spirit be clad in the beauty of holiness. Show the fruit of daily consecration. Christ calls for fruit-bearing branches. Bring forth fruit to the glory of God. \"Ye are the light of the world. . . . Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good \n\n\n                                  -39- \n\nworks, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 5:14,16).-- Manuscript 67, 1906, pp. 4, 5.
