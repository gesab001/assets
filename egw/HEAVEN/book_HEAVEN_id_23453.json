    "word": "Others will express their gratitude to those who fed the hungry, who clothed the naked. \"When despair bound my soul in unbelief, the Lord sent you to me to speak words of faith and hope and comfort. You brought me food for my physical necessities. You treated me as a brother. You sympathized with me in my sorrows, and restored my bruised and wounded soul, that I could grasp the hand of Christ that was reached out to save me. You taught me patiently in my ignorance that I had a heavenly Father who cared for me. \n\n\n                                   -266- \n\nYou read to me the precious promises of God's Word. You inspired in me faith that He would save me. My heart was softened, subdued, broken, as I contemplated [that] Christ gave His life for me. I became hungry for the word of life, and the truth was precious to my soul; and I am here, saved, eternally saved, to ever live in the presence of Him, and to praise Him who gave His life for me.\"--Ms 25, 1896. \n\nEllen G.
