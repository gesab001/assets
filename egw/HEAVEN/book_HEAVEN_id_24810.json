    "word": "-72- \n\n     Those who have this Spirit will be earnest laborers with God. The heavenly intelligences cooperate with them, and they go weighted with the spirit of the message of truth which they bear. They are a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. They are ennobled, refined, through the sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. They have not brought into the treasury of the soul wood, hay, and stubble, but gold, silver, and precious stones. They speak words of solid sense, and from the treasure of the heart bring forth pure and sacred things according to the example of Christ.",
