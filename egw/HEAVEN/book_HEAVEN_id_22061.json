    "word": "Signs and Wonders \n     Earth Quaked at the Tread of Heavenly Throng. Signs and wonders in the heavens were given to the wise men in the East who were searching for Christ.

Angels were present in the judgment hall, and when Christ was scourged with the cruel thongs, they could scarcely endure the sight. Angels of heaven were present at His death. The darkness that covered the earth at His crucifixion concealed the company of heaven's powerful agencies, but the earth quaked at the tread of the heavenly throng. The rocks were rent; for three hours the earth was shrouded in impenetrable darkness; nature with her dark robes hid the sufferings of the Son of God.",
