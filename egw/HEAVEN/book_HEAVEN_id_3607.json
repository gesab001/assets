    "word": "The life of Christ had ever been without worldly wealth, honor, or display. His humility and self-denial had been in striking contrast to the pride and self-indulgence of the priests and elders. His spotless purity was a continual reproof of their sins. They despised Him for His humility, holiness, and purity. But those who despised Him here will one day see Him in the grandeur of heaven and the unsurpassed glory of His Father.",
