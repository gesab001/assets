    "word": "Temptations will come to every soul to pursue a course which will make him a spiritual weakling. Let those who have the cause and work of God at heart say, I will do nothing to place the publishing institution in embarrassment in order to satisfy personal demands; for such an example will open the door to increased selfishness, and lessen the means which should be used in the lifting the standard in foreign countries. Christ is our strength. He can enable us to stand uncorrupted, true, pure, holy, under temptation. In his strength alone we can endure hardness as good soldiers. With Christ enthroned in our hearts we are enabled to reach the highest standard, and in heaven our names appear as overcomers, because we are complete in him. \n                             E. G. White.",
