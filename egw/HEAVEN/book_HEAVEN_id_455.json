    "word": "The Plant--An Object Lesson in Child Training.-- The gradual development of the plant from the seed is an object lesson in child training. There is \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" Mark \n                                                                           28\n4:28. He who gave this parable created the tiny seed, gave it its vital properties, and ordained the laws that govern its growth. And the truths taught by the parable were made a reality in His own life. He, the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, became a babe in Bethlehem, and for a time represented the helpless infant in its mother's care. In childhood He spoke and acted as a child, honoring His parents, and carrying out their wishes in helpful ways. But from the first dawning of intelligence He was constantly growing in grace and in a knowledge of truth.",
