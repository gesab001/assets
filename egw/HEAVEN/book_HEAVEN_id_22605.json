    "word": "MR No. 783 - The Danger of Going to Extremes\n\n     The light shines from the sacred pages, in clear, glorious beams, showing us God, the living God, as represented in the laws of His government, in the creation of the world, in the heavens which He hath garnered. His power is to be recognized as the only means of redeeming a world from degrading superstitions which are so dishonoring to God and man. Every student of the Bible who becomes familiar with revealed truth not only through the education of the intellect but through its transforming power upon heart and character, will represent the character of God to our world in a well-ordered life and a godly conversation.",
