    "word": "Every one of us can do something, if we will only take the position that God would have us take. My brethren, every move that you make to enlighten others, brings you nearer into harmony with the God of heaven. If you sit down and fold your hands, saying, \"I can barely support my family,\" you will never do anything; but if you say, \"I will do something for the truth, I will see it advance, I will do what I can,\" God will open ways so that you can do something. You should invest in the cause of truth, so that you will feel that you are a part of it.--Missionary Magazine, April, 1901. \n\n                                               -",
