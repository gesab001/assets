    "word": "Every Word Spoken an Influence--The fear of God, the sense of his goodness, his holiness, will circulate through every institution.  An atmosphere of love and peace will pervade every department.  Every word spoken, every work performed, will have an influence that corresponds to the influence of heaven.  Christ will abide in humanity, and humanity will abide in Christ.  In all the work will appear not the character of finite men, but the character of the infinite God.  The divine influence imparted by holy angels will impress the minds brought in contact with the workers; and from these workers a fragrant influence will go forth to those who choose to inhale it.--Review and Herald, April 28, 1903.",
