    "word": "The glory of heaven is in lifting up the fallen, comforting the distressed. . . . No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste is recognized by God. . . .

Christ came to demolish every wall of partition, to throw open every compartment of the temple, that every soul may have free access to God.

It places them within reach of the throne of God, the throne encircled by the rainbow of promise. . . .",
