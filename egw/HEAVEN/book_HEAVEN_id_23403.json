    "word": "Elmshaven, St. Helena Sanitarium, California, July 23, 1907 \n\n     I thank my heavenly Father for His great blessing that He has given me --freedom from pain the past night. I could not sleep after two o'clock. I arose and dressed and wrote some things in my diary. I am having kept before me in clear lines, \"He that winneth souls is wise.\" Bible religion I am urging upon our people. We are not to make our own standard. Christ has come to our world to become our standard and pattern.",
