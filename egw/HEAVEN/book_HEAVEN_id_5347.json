    "word": "Although Israel had \u201cmocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets,\u201d [2 Chronicles 36:15, 16.] he had still manifested himself to them, as \u201cthe Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth;\u201d [Exodus 34:6.] notwithstanding repeated rejections, his mercy had continued its pleadings. With more than a father's pitying love for the son of his care, God had \u201csent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place.\u201d [2 Chronicles 36:15, 16.] When remonstrance, entreaty, and rebuke had failed, he sent to them the best gift of Heaven; nay, he poured out all Heaven in that one gift.",
