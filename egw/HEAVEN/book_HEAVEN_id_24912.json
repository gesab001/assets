    "word": "\"Yes,\" one says, \"this is exactly what I believe in--consolidation.\" But this unity is not what the world calls consolidation. Unity among brethren results in consolidation with Christ and with the heavenly angels. Such consolidation is heaven-born. It is that for which Christ longed when He prayed, \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on \n\n\n                               -210- \n\nMe through their word; that they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, That they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as We are one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me\" [John 17:20-23].",
