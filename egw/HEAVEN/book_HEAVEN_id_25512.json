    "word": "Many sermons are preached that are Christless as was the offerings of Cain, and heavenly intelligences look with amazement and sorrow upon the self-tainted, worthless offering. Could men realize how their services are regarded by heaven, they would humble themselves before God. Many workers have educated themselves as debaters and critics; but have they the example of Christ for dealing with souls in this way?--No, and unless this class of workers shall humble their hearts before God, they cannot sit with Christ upon his throne. Only those who have the Spirit of a little child will enter into the kingdom of heaven. Should Christ come to our world as he came at his first advent, many who imagine themselves to be children of God, would criticize him. Those who think they are keen, smart men, who are wise in their own conceit, need to know Jesus and him crucified. They need to understand the power of his grace. All our hope is founded and sustained by Christ, then when our ministers fall on the Rock and are broken, they will say, \"More of Christ and less of theories.\"",
