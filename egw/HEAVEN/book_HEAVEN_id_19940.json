    "word": "\"Learn of Me,\" Christ says, \"and ye shall find rest unto your soul.\" Why do we not learn of the Saviour every day? Why do we not live in constant communion with Him, so that in our connection with one another, we can speak and act kindly and courteously? Why do we not honor the Lord by manifesting tenderness \n                                                                           25\nand love for one another? If we speak and act in harmony with the principles of heaven, unbelievers will be drawn to Christ by their association with us.",
