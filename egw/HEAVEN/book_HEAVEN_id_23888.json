    "word": "Those who have been baptized and have taken their stand on the Lord's side, separating from the enemy, have pledged themselves to the service of God. When you went down into the water and were baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, these three great powers of heaven pledged themselves to give you power and grace to resist every temptation to dishonor God. When you rose from the water, you represented the resurrection of Christ.",
