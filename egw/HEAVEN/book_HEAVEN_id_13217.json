What was the work of the God-given messenger to our world? The only begotten Son of God clothed his divinity with humanity, and came to our world as a teacher, an instructor, to reveal truth in contrast with error. Truth, saving truth, never languished on his tongue, never suffered in his hands, but was made to stand out plainly and clearly defined amid the moral darkness prevailing in our world. For this work he left the heavenly courts. He said of himself, \"For this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.\" The truth came from his lips with freshness and power, as a new revelation. He was the way, the truth, and the life. His life, given for this sinful world, was full of earnestness and momentous results; for his work was to save perishing souls. He came forth to be the True Light, shining amid the moral darkness of superstition and error, and was announced by a voice from heaven, proclaiming, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" And at his transfiguration this voice from heaven was again heard, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.\" \n                                                                           4",
