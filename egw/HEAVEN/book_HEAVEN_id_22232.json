    "word": "In your morning worship, consider the thought that our Saviour was a carpenter, and worked with His father, Joseph. The Prince of heaven worked as you are working with the hands. He had been the exalted commander in heaven, but He laid aside His kingly crown, and came to our world, living a life of toil and hardship, that He might enter into full sympathy with the human race. By receiving Him, you are given power to become the sons of God.",
