[Counsels to Writers, pp. 152-157, quoted. On page 157 the following statement was omitted; \"You have been deprived of your temporal eyesight; but if you have bought the spiritual eyesalve from the heavenly Merchantman, and anointed your eyes that you may see, your spiritual light will be of far more value to you than gold and silver and precious stones.\" . . .]",
