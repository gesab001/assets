    "word": "The Holy Spirit has often come to our schools and has not been recognized, but has been treated as a stranger, perhaps even as an intruder. Every teacher should know and welcome this heavenly Guest. If the teachers will open their own hearts to receive the Spirit, they will be prepared to co-operate with It in working for their students. And when It is given free course, It will effect wonderful transformations. It will work in each heart, correcting selfishness, molding and refining the character, and bringing even the thoughts into captivity to Christ.",
