    "word": "Hoarded wealth is not merely useless, it is a curse. In this life it is a snare to the soul, drawing the affections away from the heavenly treasure. In the great day of God its witness to unused talents and neglected opportunities will condemn its possessor. . . . He who realizes that his money is a talent from God will use it economically, and will feel it a duty to save that he may give.",
