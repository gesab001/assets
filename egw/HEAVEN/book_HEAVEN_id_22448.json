    "word": "MR No. 642 - Christians to Reflect God's Character\n\n     It would be sad if those who profess to love our heavenly Father should misrepresent Him.

If we bring the light and glory of heaven into our religious service, we place the religion of Jesus Christ upon that high and elevated plane where the Bible places it.",
