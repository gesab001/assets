    "word": "Christ took human nature upon Him, and came to our world to represent and establish the truth. Those who depart from the path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord will fall under the deceptive reasoning of Satan. He becomes their leader and under his direction they search for scientific problems and erroneous sentiments. I am instructed to say, Woe be to those who give place to the deceptive, insinuating sentiments of the enemy. They are no longer safe leaders and they do not realize where they are being led. There is no danger so great as for a man to refuse to confess his errors and to seek to climb to heaven through his study of science. Such a man is not being led of God, but by Satan, who is using deceptive theories to ruin his soul. He who stubbornly refuses to see the light will be given up to his own sophistry and will lose the power to distinguish between truth and error.",
