    "word": "There is a power for good in intellect, if it is conformed to the mind of Christ, sanctified and controlled by the Spirit of God. But intellect alone cannot give a fitness for heaven, or enable us to reach the divine standard. In order for a man to be what God desires him to be, he must have a pure, noble character.

Before man can be acknowledged as a laborer together with God, he must get out of and away from the self-confidence that claims much and gives little. . . .",
