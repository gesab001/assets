    "word": "From this time believe that the Lord can do all things, that He can make you a consistent Christian who wears the beauty of His heavenly character in the home life. A loving, lovable Christian is the most powerful argument in favor of the truth. Love your Saviour. Have your heart saturated with the holy oil that is \n\n\n                                     -26- \n\nemptied from the two olive trees (Zechariah 4:11-14). We want that oil emptied from the olive trees into our hearts every day. Then our tongues will speak forth the praise of our God. Looking unto Jesus, catching the light of His countenance, the light of His righteousness, we can turn deformity and sullenness and our many words of speech, into sound words, and our deformity of character will be removed.",
