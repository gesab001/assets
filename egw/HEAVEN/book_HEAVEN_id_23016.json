    "word": "Sister _____ has been at disagreement with her mother, and she has thought she has had provocation, but if she had been truly converted she would have borne with the little annoyances that arose. Sister _____ has talked too much to others of her home trouble, and has obtained sympathy and advice which have been an injury to her. As a professed daughter of the heavenly King she should have borne the perplexities with meekness and self-control.",
