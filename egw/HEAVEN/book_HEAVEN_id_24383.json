    "word": "I do not demerit Bible Readings. It is a book which will do a great amount of good, but it can never take the place that the Lord designed that Vol. 4 should have in the world and among our people. I have spread before them the light given me of heaven in that book. In conversation with Frank he was constantly referring to Thoughts on Daniel and Revelation--that no more had been done for that than for Vol. 4. I consider that that book should go everywhere. It has its place and will do a grand good work. It is a light, an intelligence which the world needs. I place no demerit on it, but that the arguments used in this line lift no burden from my weight of responsibility.",
