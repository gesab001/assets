    "word": "I have just received a letter from Sara giving the first account we have heard of Mary's death. She died praising the Lord. Mary bade farewell with cheerfulness. Her children especially received her attention. Then Ella went upstairs weeping and she said, \"I feel very sad, but somehow my heart is happy. It will be only a little while and I shall meet my dear mother and I mean to so live that I can meet her in heaven.\" Ella is nine years old the seventeenth of next January. Mabel, four the first of November next. Poor little motherless lambs! But the Lord will gently lead the lambs of the flock. Poor Willie is indeed bereaved. He never is demonstrative, therefore he will mourn alone and feel it deeper. My heart is sore and sad. They will be at Battle Creek Tuesday afternoon. I have received no news when the funeral will be. Suppose it will be Wednesday.",
