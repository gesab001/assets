    "word": "In the judgment, when we stand around the great white throne, what evidence will be presented for the law of God? The victim of Calvary's cross testifies that God could not change His law, but that He \"so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son\" in order to give man another trial to see if he would keep the commandments. This will decide our destiny for eternity, because if we are obedient children here we will be obedient children there. He will not take those to heaven who have no respect for the law. He has a law to govern in heaven. But God will not force anyone to keep the commandments, because every soul is elected to be saved if they will obey the light that falls upon their pathway. \n\n\n                                    -237-",
