    "word": "Selfishness, covetousness, and fraud bear sway in the world. There are thousands and millions who know nothing of their true relation to God, nothing of the laws which He has given them, nothing of the consequence of disobedience. Many are not ignorant of the facts, but they do not duly consider these facts as applied to their own case. All know that they must die, but not all ask themselves the question, \"What shall be the future of my soul?\" They know that there is a judgment to come, but their minds are so darkened that they are utterly unconcerned regarding what this judgment will bring to them. They have no realization of the selfishness of sin. They follow a course which the Lord of heaven has told them not to follow.",
