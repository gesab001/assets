    "word": "Laborers in the Office. \n\n     Those in the Office who have professed to believe the truth should show the power of the truth in their lives, and prove that they are working onward and upward from the basis of principle. They should be molding their lives and characters after the perfect Model. If all could look with a discerning eye into the tremendous realities of eternity, what a horror of condemnation would seize some in the Office, who now pass on with seeming indifference, although separated from eternal scenes by a very small space. Many warnings have been given, and urged home with intense feeling and earnest prayers, every one of which is faithfully registered in Heaven, to balance the account of each in the day of final investigation. The unwearying love of Christ has followed those engaged in his work in the Office. God has followed those connected with the Office with blessings and entreaties, yet hating the sins and unfaithfulness that cling to them as the leprosy. The deep and solemn truths that those in the Office have had the privilege of listening to, should take hold upon their sympathies and lead them to a high appreciation of the light God has given them. If they will walk in the light, it will beautify and ennoble their lives with Heaven's own adornment, purity and true goodness. \n                                                                           20",
