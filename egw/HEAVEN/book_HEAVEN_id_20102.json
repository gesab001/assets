    "word": "Among ministers there must be more self-forgetfulness, a more complete hiding of themselves in Christ Jesus, in order that they may work the works of God, in order to win souls both by preaching the Word and by ministering in the homes in visiting the people, in praying with them, in presenting to them the heavenly manna of the Word of God, educating them to contemplate the love of Christ. In doing this work, the minister will be attended by angels of heaven, and will be himself instructed and enlightened in the truth that maketh wise unto salvation. In visiting the people he will learn their necessities, and his sympathies will be called out. The love of Jesus for blood-bought souls will manifest itself in tenderness to the lost, and will grow by exercise: He will sink self in his interest for the work. He will have many straight and plain words to address to those who need them; for when God commissions men to do his work, he lays upon them the burden of watching for souls as they that must give an account. When needed, warnings are to be given, sins are to be rebuked, errors and wrongs are to be corrected, not only in the pulpit but by personal labor. This is divine work; and although it is not congenial to the natural inclinations, the minister must proclaim the straight truth, which will make the ears of them that hear tingle; he must lay before those who are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, the dangers and perils that are around them, and the doom that awaits the impenitent. \n                                                                           6",
