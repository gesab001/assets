    "word": "Hundreds have sacrificed Christ and heaven in consequence of marrying unconverted persons. . . . The happiness and prosperity of the married life depend upon the unity of the parties. How can the carnal mind harmonize with the mind that is assimilated to the mind of Christ? . . . There is a perpetual difference of taste, of inclination, and of purpose.
