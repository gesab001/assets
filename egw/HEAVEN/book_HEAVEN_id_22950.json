    "word": "MR No. 997 - Ellen White and the Stanmore Church in Sydney, Australia\n\n     Soul Winning at Stanmore--I feel very grateful to my heavenly Father for the strength He has given me to reach this place. At Morisset we got into a ladies' compartment, in which were three women, one young girl, and one well-behaved baby. The seat was hard, and I had to sit up, but I was not tired. When we reached Gosford, we changed into a second-class compartment, and the seats were in every way as good as in the first-class car.",
