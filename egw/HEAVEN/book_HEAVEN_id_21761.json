    "word": "Family, Members of, Will Know Each Other in Heaven.--God's greatest gift is Christ, whose life is ours, given for us. He died for us, and was raised for us, that we might come forth from the tomb to a glorious companionship with heavenly angels, to meet our loved ones and to recognize their faces; for the Christ likeness does not destroy their image, but transforms it into His glorious image. Every saint connected in family relationship here will know each other there.--Letter 79, 1898. \n\n\n                                     -324-",
