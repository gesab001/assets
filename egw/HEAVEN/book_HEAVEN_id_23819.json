    "word": "Tuesday, October 17, 10:30 A.M. Well, I am sitting in the phaeton before the botanical gardens, while Elder Daniells, Emily Campbell, and May Walling are enjoying the privilege of going in and viewing that which is to be seen. As I cannot walk or stand on my feet much, I am sitting here. I have no wheelchair, nor one to wheel it and wait on me, as I had in Philadelphia. I must be content to sit and wait patiently until their sightseeing is ended. This is a beautiful day and we are thankful to our heavenly Father for the glad sunshine. \n\n\n                                  -90-",
