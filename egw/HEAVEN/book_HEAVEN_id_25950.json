    "word": "Willingly and cheerfully the true Christian will bind about his own inclinations to invest his means, God's own relief fund, in a larger work than he could possibly manage. If he sees that his fellow laborers in other portions of the field are pained and perplexed by a lack of proper facilities, he will willingly impart to them a portion of what the Lord has entrusted to him. As he shows by his unselfishness that he loves his neighbor as himself, the Lord says of him in the councils of heaven, \"He is faithful steward. I can trust him to handle my goods. He keeps my fear before him. His works of righteousness will be a continual stream flowing to the desert portions of my vineyard. He will not claim what he has as his own, to use as the human agent pleases. He will heed my counsel, and do with my goods as I shall choose.\"",
