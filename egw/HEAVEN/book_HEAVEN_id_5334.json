    "word": "To every worker for God this thought should be a stimulus and an encouragement. In this life our work for God often seems to be almost fruitless. Our efforts to do good may be earnest and persevering, yet we may not be permitted to witness their results. To us the effort may seem to be lost. But the Saviour assures us that our work is noted in heaven, and that the recompense cannot fail. The apostle Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit, says, \"Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\" [Galatians 6:9.] And in the words of the psalmist we read, \"He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious \n                                                                           513\nseed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\" [Psalm 126:6.]",
