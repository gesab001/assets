    "word": "A Distinct People With a Testing Message.--The Lord has been pleased to give His people the third angel's message as a testing message to bear to the world. John beholds a people distinct and separate from the world, who refuse to worship the beast or his image, who bear God's sign, keeping holy His Sabbath--the seventh-day to be kept holy as a memorial of the living God, the Creator of heaven and earth. Of them the apostle writes, \"Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\"-- Letter 98, 1900.",
