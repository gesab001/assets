    "word": "Some gleams of truth were penetrating the ruler's mind. Christ's words filled him with awe, and led to the inquiry. \"How can these things be?\" With deep earnestness, Jesus answered, \"Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?\" Surely one entrusted with the religious interests of the people, should not be ignorant of truth so important for them to understand as the condition of entrance into the kingdom of heaven. Christ's words conveyed the lesson, that instead of feeling irritated over the plain words of truth, and indulging in irony, Nicodemus should have a far more humble opinion of himself, because of his spiritual ignorance. Yet the words of Christ were spoken with such solemn dignity, and both look and tone expressed such earnest love, that Nicodemus was not offended as he realized his humiliating position. \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee,\" continued Jesus, \"we speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, If I tell you of heavenly things?\"",
