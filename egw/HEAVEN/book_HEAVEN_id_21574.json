    "word": "Oh, that those who have not the milk of human kindness in them might see that their thoughts, their feelings, words, and actions must be decidedly changed in order that the prayer of Christ may be fulfilled in the church. Their harsh, denunciatory spirit, their judging and evil speaking must be separated from them, or else they will continually scatter away from Christ. They should be exercising a sanctified influence, gathering with Christ in drawing souls to Him by the tender cords of love. The converting power of God must come upon the church in Hobart. A reformation must take place in the character of those who professedly are its most zealous members, or else because of their want of love they will wound and bruise and leave to perish many poor souls. Let the prayer go forth from unfeigned lips that the anointing of the Holy Spirit may come upon the eyes of the blind, so that each one may discern what is the estimate that Christ places upon the human soul. Christ was the Majesty of heaven, yet He left us an example of goodness, sympathy, and compassion in dealing with suffering humanity.",
