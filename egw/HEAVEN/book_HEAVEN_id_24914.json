    "word": "\"Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him.\" Let us consider this prophecy. We should \n\n\n             -214- \n\nrealize that whether we be saved or whether we be lost, we shall sometime see the Saviour as He is, in all His glory, and shall understand His character. At His second coming conviction will be brought to every heart. Those who have cast Him aside, those who have turned from Him to the trivial things of this earth, those who in this life have sought their own interests and glory, will in the day of His coming acknowledge their mistake. These are the ones who, in the language of the Revelator, are spoken of as \"all kindreds of the earth\" who \"shall wail because of Him.\" Let us not be content to be numbered among the \"kindreds of the earth.\" Our citizenship is in heaven, and we are to lay hold on the hope set before us in the gospel.",
