    "word": "I have been shown that you could do a greater and more substantial work if your life practice was in close harmony with the principles of truth. The power of the Spirit shown in heart and conscience in your home life, and in association with your brethren, will have a decided influence upon others. \"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\" You cannot be mixed up in financial matters without giving the burden of your thoughts to worldly plans and calculations. As soon as you are out of the desk, you become enthusiastic over business matters, and show that you are intoxicated over the matter of obtaining means. An important work has been given you of the Master, to preach the gospel of the Old and New Testament. You are to feed the flock of God. Do no flatter \n\n\n                        [32] \n\none's imagination with high hopes of earthly treasure; point men to the heavenly inheritance; call their attention to the mansions Christ has gone to prepare for those who love him and keep his commandments. As a faithful watchman, you are to warn the souls that are in peril through worldliness, of their danger. Supposing it is no sin for those whom God has not called to minister in word and doctrine, to engage in real-estate business and mining stocks, would it not be altogether another matter for you, a watchman upon the walls of Zion, to do so? Your mind should be on altogether different themes. Eternal interests demand your whole soul, your whole might, mind, and strength. You need to be constantly digging in the precious mine of the Scriptures, that you may bring forth from the treasure-house of God's word things new and old. Great light is opening to all God's people whose hearts are open to receive it, but those who are satisfied with their present knowledge will not desire the rich blessings God has for his people.",
