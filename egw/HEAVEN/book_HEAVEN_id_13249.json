    "word": "The most effective way to teach the heathen who know not God, is through his works. In \n                                                                           60\nthis way, far more readily than by any other method, they can be made to realize the difference between their idols, the works of their own hands, and the true God, the Maker of heaven and earth. The same principle applies to the ignorant, neglected colored race in that part of America where slavery once existed. When these lowly members of the human family have learned to know God through his works, a foundation will be laid for the spiritual truths of the written word, which will elevate and purify their characters.",
