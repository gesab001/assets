    "word": "The Lord allowed Satan to go on and demonstrate his principles. God did establish Himself, and He carried the worlds unfallen and the heavenly universe with Him, but at a terrible cost. His only begotten Son was given up as Satan's victim. The Lord Jesus Christ revealed a character entirely opposite to that of Satan. As the high priest laid [off] his gorgeous pontifical robes, and officiated in the white linen dress of a common priest, so Christ emptied Himself and took the form of a servant, and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim.",
