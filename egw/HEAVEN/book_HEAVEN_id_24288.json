    "word": "It has been a continual cross for me to be so far away from you and friends I love, but when I know that I am in the path of obedience I am happy. Privations are nothing, trials are nothing, distress and anguish of soul for others I can bear without a murmur. Only let me know that I am doing the will of my heavenly Father and I am content. I feel that I would not shrink from any hardship or difficulty if it is for Jesus' sake.",
