    "word": "Read in my books, \"Patriarchs and Prophets,\" and \"Great Controversy,\" the story of the first great apostasy. History is being repeated and will be repeated. Read then, and understand. The time is drawing to a close when power of influence, of intellect, of knowledge in science, can cover the least departure from the Lord's way. He has pledged His word that He will humble every oppressor of His ministers, or the appointed agencies engaged in His work. Persecuting powers will be brought to judgment; for all the resources of heaven and earth are to be called at God's command to do His work. God sees and knows those who are proud and self-sufficient, and He will bring them into judgment. Before the flood men cast off the fear of God, and trampled under foot His holy law, but judgment overtook them. Read Isaiah 47:10.",
