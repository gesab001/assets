    "word": "The work of teachers is an important one. They should make the word of God their meditation. God will communicate by his own Spirit to the soul. Pray as you study, \"Lord, open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.\" When the teacher will rely upon God in prayer, the Spirit of Christ will come upon him, and God will work through him by the Holy Spirit upon the minds of the student.

The beauty and virtue of the word of God has a transforming influence upon mind and character; the sparks of heavenly love will fall upon the hearts of the children as an inspiration. We may bring hundreds and thousands of children to Christ if we will work for them.",
