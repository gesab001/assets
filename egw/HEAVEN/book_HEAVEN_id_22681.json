    "word": "God desires those who are connected with any branch of His work to be associated closely with Himself. None need feel that they are too busy to pray, too full of business cares to spend an occasional fifteen minutes to seek counsel from God. My brethren, make God your entire dependence. When you do otherwise, then it is time for a halt to be called. Stop right where you are and change the order of things. Pray first, before taking up the work of the day. Do not go through a dry form of words. Be polite, inviting the heavenly Guest to come in and take possession and to control every worker. In sincerity, in soul-hunger, cry after God. Wrestle with the heavenly agencies until you have the victory. Put your whole being into the Lord's hands, soul, body, and spirit, and resolve to be His living, consecrated agency, moved by His will, controlled by His mind, infused by His \n\n\n                                    -234- \n\nSpirit. Then the eyes of your understanding will be anointed with heavenly eyesalve. Then you will see heavenly things clearly. Like Moses, you will catch glimpses of the Holy One of Israel.--Ms. 24, 1891, pp. 16, 27. (Diary, undated. From Ms. 5, 1903, transcribed in Feb. 1903.)",
