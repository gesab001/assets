    "word": "Heavens and Earth, Reveal a Love Beyond Computation.--Christ came to this world to reveal the Father's love for fallen man. In the heavens above and in the earth beneath, in everything that is beautiful and lovely, in the lofty trees, the opening bud, the blossoming flower, we see an expression of the love of God. There is no measurement by which the love of God can be computed.--Ms 31, 1911.",
