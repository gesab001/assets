    "word": "A View of the Pattern.--For a period of time the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, was only a Babe in Bethlehem and could only represent the babe in its mother's arms. In childhood He could only do the work of an obedient child, fulfilling the wishes of His parents, in doing such duties as would correspond to His ability as a child. This is all that children can do, and they should be so educated and instructed that they may follow Christ's example. Christ acted in a manner that blessed the household in which He was found, for He was subject to His parents and thus did missionary work in His home life. It is written, \"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.\" \"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\"",
