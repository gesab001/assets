    "word": "We want to see the sick among us healed by the power of God. He cooperates with man in every reformation made. Let us take hold with Him. Climb, climb, for your souls' sake climb the ladder of progress. First ascend the lower rounds, and then climb, climb, climb; for the topmost round rests upon the threshold of heaven. Angels of God are ascending and descending that ladder of shining brightness. You can ascend round by round, round by round, and finally step off into the kingdom of glory.",
