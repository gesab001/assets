    "word": "To every church member I would say, Never, never let there be any departing from the strictest integrity. Do not mock God, the Majesty of heaven, by a disregard of his word. Never, never, defraud a fellow-being, and then suppose that your sharpness is something to be proud of. Do not follow maxims of business that are based on false pretensions. There is in this our day a great deal of falsity. The pretender, the deceiver, is increasing in numbers, and truth and integrity are violated. Lies are spoken, lies are acted, and are becoming more and more common among those who do not make the word of God their counselor.",
