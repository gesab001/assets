    "word": "We must be careful lest we misinterpret the Scriptures. The plain teachings of the word of God are not to be so spiritualized, that the reality is lost sight of. Do not overstrain the meaning of sentences in the Bible in an effort to bring forth something odd in order to please the fancy. Take the Scriptures as they read. Avoid idle speculation concerning what will be in the kingdom of heaven.--MS-30-1904.",
