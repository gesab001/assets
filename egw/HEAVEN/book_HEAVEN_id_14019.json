    "word": "Then are fulfilled the words of the prophet: \"The \n                                                                           488\nindignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.\" [Isaiah 34:2.] \"Upon the wicked he shall rain quick burning coals, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.\" [Psalm 11:6. MARGIN.] Fire comes down from God out of heaven. The earth is broken up. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames burst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire. The day has come that shall burn as an oven. [Malachi 4:1.] The elements melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein are burned up. [2 Peter 3:10.] The fire of Tophet is \"prepared for the king,\" the chief of rebellion; the pile thereof is deep and large, and \"the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.\" [Isaiah 30:33.] The earth's surface seems one molten mass,--a vast, seething lake of fire. It is the time of the judgment and perdition of ungodly men, --\"the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.\" [Isaiah 34:8.]",
