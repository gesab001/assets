    "word": "God has delivered us from discouragement and bondage of darkness. In Him is no darkness at all. God will place our feet in a large place. We shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life. Streams of light seemed to come upon us from our heavenly Father and the room seemed to be illuminated with the presence of the Lord.--Letter 20, 1872. (To Edson and Willie White, December 7, 1872.)",
