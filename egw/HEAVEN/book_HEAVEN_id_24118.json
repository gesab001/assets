    "word": "Let every idol be cleansed from the soul temple, for this must be if you grow up to the full stature of a man in Christ Jesus. Heaven is worth everything to us. We are to fix our eyes upon Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith, and press forward toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Will you make straight paths for your feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way? Will you, by faith, grasp the hand of infinite power and say, \"Jesus, I am Thine; Thou hast purchased me--my reason, which I must not dim by any indulgence; my affections, which I must not withhold from Thee who hast first loved me; my virtue, which I will not tarnish, for this would dishonor my Redeemer? Take me just as I am, weak, helpless, unworthy; bind my heart to Thy great heart of infinite love. I would stand purified, refined, ennobled, sanctified through the truth. Then shall I discern between the sacred and the common.\"",
