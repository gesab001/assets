    "word": "No man who is dishonest with God or with his fellow men can truly prosper. The most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, says, \"Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small. Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small. But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the Lord thy God.\" Through the prophet Micah, the Lord again expresses His abhorrence of dishonesty: \"Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable? Shall I count them pure with the wicked \n                                                                           78\nbalances? . . . Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins.\"--R. & H., Dec. 17, 1889.",
