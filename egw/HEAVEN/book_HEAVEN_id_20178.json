    "word": "Why should we be surprised if the offerings we present to God in cheerfulness and love are increased by him? We do not learn half as much as we should from the lessons of the Bible. The sanctified mind will see that God unites with the one who gives to him with unselfishness; for such action is akin to heavenly benevolence. We need to take a far broader and more trustful view of God's relation to this world and his people, through whom he is working to carry out his purposes. By the touch of his divine hand and the word of blessing from his lips, Jesus can increase the scanty provision. By his power he can multiply the scanty store until it is sufficient to place in the hands of his servants for the carrying forward of his work.",
