    "word": "We are not to exalt the work of any man, magnifying him and praising his judgment. The first rising of self is the beginning of your fall, your separation from Christ. We cannot in any degree exalt self without being humbled. As Christians, we are to make the light of Christ's truth shine. Self is to be kept out of sight. Christ is the truth and the Light. He is the mirror from which we reflect truly every work done to his name's glory. The world needs light. \"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\"",
