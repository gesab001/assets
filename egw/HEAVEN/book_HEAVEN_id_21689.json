    "word": "I would entreat those here to think of those things. Go to work for the Master. Take the Lord with you, and then you will hear from the lips of the Master, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant.\" Heaven, sweet heaven of rest! It is then that we shall cast our glittering crowns at the feet of Jesus, and touch our harps and sing the song, \"Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that died for us.\" I see in Him matchless charms. I want all to have a part and share in the eternal weight of glory, and to sing songs of rejoicing through the endless ages of eternity.--Ms 46, 1886, pp. 1-6.
