    "word": "If you could only see yourself and that past experience which you value so highly, as God sees you, you would abhor yourself. While you congratulate yourself that you are not like those in whom you think you see faults and wrongs, you are not awake to your own state. You will have no credit for your keen eyesight in discerning other's errors, for you do not see that you are making far greater blunders than you accuse them of making. Were your eyes anointed with the spiritual eyesalve, you would but have bitter self-upbraiding. You do not know what spirit prompts you to action. You are self-deceived. God alone can change your perverted heart. He alone can transform your character and prepare you for the kingdom of heaven. . . .",
