    "word": "A true disciple of Christ will seek to imitate the Pattern. His love will lead to perfect obedience. He will study to do the will of God on earth, as it is done in heaven. He whose heart is still defiled with sin cannot be zealous of good works, and is not careful to abstain from evil, . . . is not jealous over his unruly tongue; he is not careful to deny self and lift the cross of Christ. . . .",
