    "word": "Heaven is Watching \n\n     But a change has come that has hindered the work which God designed to move forward without a trace of selfishness. All \n                                                                           132\nheaven is watching with intense anxiety to see what is to be the outcome of the work which is so large and so important. God is watching, the heavenly universe is watching; and souls are perishing. Is the enterprise of mercy through which in the past God has manifested His grace in rescuing and restoring, to become a matter of selfish merchandise? Shall the instrumentality ordained by heaven to bring good to man and glory to God be lost through improvident expenditure? Shall God's agency of blessing be used by those who profess to believe the truth in buying and selling and getting gain?",
