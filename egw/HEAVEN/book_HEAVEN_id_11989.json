    "word": "Surrounded With Heaven's Atmosphere-- 1898.--\"We love him, because he first loved us\" (1 John 4:19). True conversion, true sanctification, will be the cause of the change in our views and our feelings toward one another and toward God. \"We have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him\" (verse 16). We must increase in faith. We must know the sanctification of the Spirit. In earnest prayer we must seek God, that the divine Spirit may work in us. God then will be glorified by the example of the human agent. We shall be workers together with God.",
