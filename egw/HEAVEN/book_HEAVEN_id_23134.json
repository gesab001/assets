    "word": "We are not able to keep ourselves; we are kept by the power of God. Our Redeemer has all power in heaven and in earth, and if we do just as Jesus tells us to, we shall be kept safe in His love. In our own strength we are perfect weakness, but, when we put our whole trust in Jesus Christ, we are kept by His power, for He is fully able to keep every soul who puts his trust in Him.",
