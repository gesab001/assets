    "word": "All that is done by those connected with the Huntsville School, whether they be teachers or students, is to be done with the realization that this is the Lord\u2019s institution, in which the students are to be taught how to cultivate the land and how to labor for the uplifting of their own people. They are to work with such earnestness and perseverance that the farm will bear testimony to the world, to angels, and to men, regarding the fidelity with which this gift of land has been cared for. This is the Lord\u2019s farm, and it is to bear fruit to His glory. Heavenly angels will be able to read, in the thrift and painstaking effort revealed in the care of the farm, the story of the improvement made by the students themselves in character-building. On this farm the students are to learn how to earn their living by honest work. Such a knowledge will be of inestimable value to them when they go forth to teach others of their race.",
