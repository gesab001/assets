    "word": "Christ never ceases to seek us when we wander from the fold. With unwearying steps He searches until He finds us, and brings us back to His fold. Again and again we would have perished, had it not been for His loving care. . . . Little do we realize the strength of the forces that are now at work in this world. The whole heavenly host are seeking to save that which was lost; the fallen angels are working with a power from beneath to counteract the efforts of Christ and His colaborers. . . .",
