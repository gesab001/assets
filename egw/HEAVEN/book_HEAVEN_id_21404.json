    "word": "Let us place ourselves in the line of cooperation with God, making it possible for Him to answer our prayers. He has issued His promissory notes, declaring, \"A new heart also will I give you\" (See Ezekiel 36:26). He says that He will be found of those who seek Him with the whole heart. When you lose your hold on Christ, the bank of heaven has not failed, but you have broken your covenant with God. He cannot cover your sin while you continue in sin, refusing to let Him take away your transgression, because you suppose that in disobeying the commands of God, you have placed yourself beyond help. The Lord says, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; \n                                                                           116\nand he shall make peace with Me\" (Isaiah 27:5).
