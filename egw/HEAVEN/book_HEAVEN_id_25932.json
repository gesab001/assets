    "word": "My brother, there is danger of those in our ranks making a mistake in regard to receiving the Holy Ghost. Many suppose an emotion or a rapture of feeling to be an evidence of the presence of the Holy Spirit. There is danger that right sentiments will not be understood, and that Christ's words, \"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you,\" will lose their significance. There is danger that original devisings and superstitious imaginings will take the place of the Scriptures. Be not anxious to bring in something not revealed in the Word. Keep close to Christ. Remember his words, \"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" He is with us as we teach the words he spoke in the Old Testament as well as in the New. He who gave commandment in the New Testament is the One also who gave the instruction contained in the Old Testament. The Old and the New Testaments are both sacred; for they both contain the words of Christ. All communication from heaven to earth since Adam's fall has come through Christ. He who believes the instruction contained in the New Testament and in the Old, doing those things which Christ has commanded therein, has the Saviour always with him.",
