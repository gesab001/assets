    "word": "Now there is an additional property that has come to us. Of course we have not purchased it, but we are glad of the addition. Why? Because we shall need it - every foot of it. I know how the matter has been presented to me. And I want to say that the Lord wants us to represent the Christian character. That is what he wants us to do. And it has not been represented here, not by all. But what did Christ do? When they tell me, \"Why do you with all your work bring this child and that child and the other child?\" Why, I said, \"They would lose their souls if I did not.\" They have got to be educated kindly and brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. And I want to say that the Lord wants every soul of us to be in a position not to strive for the greatest place or the greatest honor. He wants us to work out the disposition that he may work in if you will let him. And we want the truth, and we want you to stand in that position that we will feel that we have not taken all these responsibilities for naught. We want to realize it. Why, I have tried with all my might to work at this and that and the other that would be a blessing, and we must be where we can cooperate with Heaven. And may the Lord give us grace and his Holy Spirit.",
