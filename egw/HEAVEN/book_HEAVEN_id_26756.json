    "word": "The Lord wants us to come into harmony with his spirit. If we will do this, his spirit can rule our minds. If we have a true understanding of what constitutes the essential education, and endeavor to teach its principles, Christ will stand by us to help us. He promised to his followers that when they should stand before councils and judges, they were to take no thought what they should speak. I will instruct you, He said, I will guide you. Knowing what it is to be taught of God, when words of heavenly wisdom are brought to our mind, we will distinguish them from our own thoughts. We will understand them as the words of God, and we will see in them life and power for us.",
