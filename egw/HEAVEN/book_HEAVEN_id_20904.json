    "word": "God says to those who profess to believe in Him, Go forth into all parts of the world, and diffuse the light of My truth, that men and women may be led to Christ. Let us awake to our duty, and do all that we can to help forward the Lord's work. Let superficial excuses be blown to the four winds. Let decided action commence on the part of all who can help. Let them co-operate with the angels sent from the heavenly courts to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation. Forget not the words, \"We are laborers together with God.\" No longer grieve the Spirit of God by delaying. [MS., 1901.] \n                                                                           18",
