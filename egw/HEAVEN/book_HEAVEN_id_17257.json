    "word": "The truth is refining and elevating, and believers must understand that even though they are poor, they need not be unclean in their persons or in their homes. On this line true missionary work is to be done for those who have no sense of what it means to be pure and clean in person and dress. The poor can be taught to undertake this work for themselves. Teach them that those who serve God and keep His commandments must keep their souls pure and clean, and that this purity must extend to their dress, their homes, their cooking utensils, their floors, because the ministering angels from the courts of heaven must have every evidence that the precious truth which has been received into the heart has made a decided reformation in the life.",
