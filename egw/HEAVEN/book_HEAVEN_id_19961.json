    "word": "Those who are connected with Christ, the chief worker, will represent his character in all their work. God is calling men, \"Come to me as my helpers in the performance of my work.\" Righteousness and truth are the habitation of this throne. No man can execute his will who has not surrendered himself to God, that God's will may be done in him. \"Come to me as my right-hand helper,\" will be the message to the faithful of the land,--the men who are trustworthy, who will exalt the God of heaven, not merely in their words, but in their deeds; men who can be relied on to do their duty under all trials, and whatever the circumstances may be. \n                                                                           38",
