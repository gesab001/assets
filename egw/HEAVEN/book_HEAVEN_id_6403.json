    "word": "Religion in the home means the highest type of religion in the church; but this home piety is sadly deficient. Parents have been asleep. The work in their homes has been neglected. To a great degree the children have moulded the law of the household to suit their inclination, and parents have been controlled by their unconverted children. There is need of a religious revival in every household in our land. Fathers and mothers, it is a marvel in the sight of heaven that the souls of your children are so little valued. Christ is grieved, and Satan triumphs.",
