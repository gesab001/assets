    "word": "Those who are connected with tent labor should avail themselves of all the advantages thus offered them. They should not be wandering listlessly about while discourses are being given, as though there was nothing in the sermon that they needed. They are not to regard the speaker as merely one who is delivering an oration, but as God's messenger, bearing a message from heaven to men. Personal preferences and prejudices must not come in to influence the hearer. All should imitate the example of Cornelius and his friends, who said, \u201cNow therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.\u201d [Acts 10:33.] If the hearers thus listen in faith, expecting a message from God through his delegated messenger, they will receive it and be profited.",
