    "word": "There are many in the same position as was Nathanael. They are prejudiced and unbelieving \n\n\n                     -22- \n\nbecause they have never come in contact with the truth or the people who hold it, and it will need but an attendance on a meeting full of the Spirit of Christ to sweep away their unbelief. No matter what we have to meet, what opposition, what efforts to turn souls away from the truth of heavenly origin, we must give publicity to our faith, that honest souls may see and hear and be convinced for themselves. Our work is to say as did Philip, \"Come and see.\" We must not put our light under a bushel but on a candlestick, that it may give light to all that are in the house.",
