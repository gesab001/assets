    "word": "The course of the Presbyterian synod in condemning Eld. Morton without granting him a hearing, is an evidence of the spirit of intolerance which still exists, even among those claiming to be Protestant reformers. The infinite God, whose throne is in the heavens, condescends to address his people, \"Come now, and let us reason together;\" [Isaiah 1:18.] but frail, erring men proudly refuse to reason with their brethren. They stand ready to censure one who accepts any light which they have not received--as though God had pledged himself to give no more light to any one than he had given to them. This is the course pursued by opposers of the truth in every age. They forget the declaration of the Scriptures, \"Light is sown for the righteous.\" [Psalm 97:11.] \"The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\" [Proverbs 4:18.] It is a sad thing when a people claiming to be reformers cease to reform. \n                                                                           186",
