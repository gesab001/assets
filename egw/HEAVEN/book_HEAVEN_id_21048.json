    "word": "The Lord draws very nigh to his people on the day that he has blessed and sanctified. \"The \n\n\n                       -35- \n\nheavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge.\" The Sabbath is God's memorial, pointing men to their Creator, who made the world and all things that are therein. In the everlasting hills, in the lofty trees, in every opening bud and blooming flower we may behold the work of the great Master-artist. All speak to us of God and his glory.",
