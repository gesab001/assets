    "word": "As a man Christ ascended to heaven. As a man He is the substitute and surety for humanity. As a man He liveth to make intercession for us. He is preparing a place for all who love Him. As a man He will come again with power and glory, to receive His children. And that which should cause us joy and thanksgiving is, that God \u201chath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained.\u201d Then we may have the assurance forever that the whole unfallen universe is interested in the grand work Jesus came to our world to accomplish, even the salvation of man.\u2014Ms 16, 1890 quoted in 5BC 1125, 1126.",
