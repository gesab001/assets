    "word": "My sister, excuse not your defects because others are wrong. You will not dare plead in the day of God as an excuse for your lack of forming a character for Heaven, that others did not manifest devotion and spirituality. The same lack which you discovered in others was in yourself. And the fact that others were sinners makes your sins none the less grievous. Both they, and you, if you continue in your present state of unfitness, will be separated from Christ, and be punished, with Satan and his angels, with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power.",
