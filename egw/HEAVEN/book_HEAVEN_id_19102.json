    "word": "The Prince of heaven, Christ, became a servant, and He accepts human beings to be laborers together with Him. He declares, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" (Matthew 28:20). No one will fail who walks in all humility of mind, learning of Christ the lessons He has given all to learn. We are safe while we strive for the mastery as an overcomer with deep, earnest love for God and for one another. . . .",
