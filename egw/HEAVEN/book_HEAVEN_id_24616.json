    "word": "Our precious Saviour has made the world, and when He came into the world He found the great usurper there, and He came into the world that He might contest with him the possession of this earth. Therefore the battle, the conflict, was carried on right here in this world, and here He tells us that it is for our eternal interest to lay up for ourselves a treasure in the heavens. You ask, How can I do it? In Christ. When the Householder went away from His house, He gave to every man talents, to some five, to some two, and to another one. And these talents He gave them direction to employ in His service, He gave to some the property of means, to others ability, intellect--all God's gifts. We could not have any of it unless it came through Jesus Christ.",
