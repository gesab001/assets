    "word": "BUT THE IDEA THAT THE WORK OF THE GOSPEL WAS FINISHED WAS SOON RENOUNCED, EXCEPT BY SOME FANATICAL ONES WHO WOULD NEITHER BE COUNSELED NOR RECEIVE INSTRUCTION. BUT MOST OF THOSE WHO RENOUNCED IT, AND YET RETAINED THEIR FAITH IN THE WORK, CONTINUED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WHO CLEARLY SAW THE LIGHT OF THE HEAVEN-SENT WARNING AND PERSISTENTLY REJECTED IT, WERE REJECTED OF THE LORD. THERE IS NO MORE FANATICISM IN THAT THAN THERE IS IN THE COMMON BELIEF THAT THOSE OBDURATE JEWS WHO CONTINUED TO REJECT THE LIGHT OF THE ADVANCED TRUTH SENT TO THAT GENERATION, WERE REJECTED OF GOD.",
