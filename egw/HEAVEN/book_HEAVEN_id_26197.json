    "word": "The Lord has greatly honored men by giving Christ as their ransom, that they might be recovered from the enemy's service. But are they willing to be recovered? Will they accept the precious gift Christ Jesus, or will they refuse to do Him service? Christ declared, \"He that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\" Those who try to do well in their finite strength will fail. But those who accept Jesus are upheld by a higher than human power. They confess Christ. They become His soldiers in their school associations. They will realize that they are enlisted to make the school the most orderly, elevated, and praiseworthy institution in the world. They will place every jot and tittle of their influence on the side of Christ and heavenly intelligences.",
