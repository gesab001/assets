    "word": "Let us love God supremely, allowing no influence to come between us and our God. We must give heed to the light which God has permitted to shine upon our pathway; we must show before all heaven that we appreciate every ray of light; we must reflect that light upon others. We are responsible to God for our influence. Even if we are compelled to stand apparently alone, we are not alone, for Christ is with us to encourage and strengthen and bless us. He is acquainted with every desire of your heart, with every purpose of your soul. He says, \"I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you\" (John 14:18). Let us believe that God will do just as He has promised. . . .",
