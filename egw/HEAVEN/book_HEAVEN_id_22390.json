    "word": "God depends upon you, the human agent, to fulfill your duty to the best of your ability, and He Himself will give the increase. If human agents would but cooperate with the divine intelligences, thousands of souls would be rescued. The Holy Spirit would give devoted workers glimpses of Jesus, that would brace them for every conflict, that would elevate and strengthen them and make them more than conquerors. When two or three are met together to unite their counsel, and to send up their petitions, the promise is for them, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" (Matthew 7:7.) \"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.\" (Luke 11:13.)",
