    "word": "Christ came to a world of sin in order to give every man an example of true, perfect obedience. In all His words and deeds He is our example. The character of holiness to which we must attain, He has plainly revealed. The path of obedience is the only path to heaven, and, through His grace, we are enabled to follow in the footsteps of our divine Lord, and walk in the strait and narrow way in which He walked.",
