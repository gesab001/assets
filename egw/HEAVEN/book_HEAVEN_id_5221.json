    "word": "In this glory of Christ all His followers are to share. The Saviour could say, \"I seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent Me.\" [John 5:30.] And John declared, \"God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him.\" So with the followers of Christ. We can receive of heaven's light only as we are willing to be emptied of self. We can discern the character of God, and accept Christ by faith, only as we consent to the bringing into captivity of every thought to the obedience of Christ. And to all who do this, the Holy Spirit is given without measure. In Christ \"dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in Him.\" [Colossians 2:9, 10.] \n\n                                               -",
