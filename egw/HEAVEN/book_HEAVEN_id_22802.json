    "word": "When men open their hearts to unbelief, they open them to the great deceiver, the accuser of the brethren. With the glorious light of truth emanating from God, with abundant evidence that the work for this time is ordained of Heaven, beware that you do not harden your hearts and ask for further proof, saying, \"Show us a miracle.\" The rich man of the parable prayed that one might be sent from the dead to warn his brethren, that they might not come to the place of torment in which he found himself. He said, \"If one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.\" But the answer came to him, as it comes to us today, \"If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead\" (Luke 16:30, 31).--Letter 4, 1889, pp. 7-13, 15-41. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D.C.
