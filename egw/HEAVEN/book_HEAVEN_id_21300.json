    "word": "The church at Battle Creek have had great light. They have been a people \n                                                                           55\npeculiarly favored of God. They have not been left in ignorance in regard to the will of God concerning them. They might be far in advance of what they now are if they had walked in the light. They are not that separate, peculiar, and holy people that their faith demands, and that God recognizes and acknowledges as children of the light. They are not obedient and devotional as their exalted position and sacred obligation require, as children walking in the light. The most solemn message of mercy ever given to the world has been intrusted to them. The Lord has made them the repositories of his commandments in a sense that no other church is. God did not show them his special favor in trusting to them his sacred truth that they alone may be benefited by the light given them; but that the light reflected upon them from Heaven should shine forth to others, and be reflected back again to God by those who receive the truth, glorifying him. Many in Battle Creek will have a fearful account to give in the day of God for this sinful neglect of duty.",
