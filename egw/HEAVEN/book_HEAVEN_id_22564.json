    "word": "We read here [Revelation 7:9] that John saw the throne of God, and around that throne a company, and he inquired, \"Who are these?\" The answer came, \"These are they which . . . have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb\" (Revelation 7:14). Christ leads them to the fountains of living waters, and there is the tree of life and there is the precious Saviour. Here is presented to us a life that measures with the life of God. There is no pain, sorrow, sickness or death there. All is peace and harmony and love. We want you to be in that heaven.",
