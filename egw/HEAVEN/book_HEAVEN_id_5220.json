    "word": "The soul of the prophet, emptied of self, was filled with the light of the Divine. In words that were almost a counterpart of the words of Christ Himself, he bore witness to the Saviour's glory. \"He that cometh \n                                                                           57\nfrom above,\" he said, \"is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: He that cometh from heaven is above all.\" \"For He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God.\" [John 3:31, 34.]",
