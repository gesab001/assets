    "word": "Let none think, because they cannot explain the meaning of every symbol in the Revelation, that it is of no use for them to search this book with deep, earnest longing and intense desire to know the meaning of the truth it contains. The One who revealed these mysteries to John can and will give the diligent searcher for truth a foretaste of heavenly things, hereafter to be realized. \n\n\n                                      -24- \n\nRich blessings will come to him who reads and hears the words of this prophecy, and keeps those things which are written therein.",
