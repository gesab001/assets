    "word": "Here Christ associates Himself, as the Son of man, with the mystic ladder. The angels of God are ascending and descending on the one even as they did on the other. By means of this ladder a constant communication is kept up between heaven and earth, and all the actions and affairs of this earth are known in heaven. The counsels of heaven are executed on earth, and the doings of men are judged in heaven.",
