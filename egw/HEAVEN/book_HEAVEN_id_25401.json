    "word": "God forbid that those who have had great light and knowledge should let their own systems become their standard and say, \"If anyone introduces anything contrary to my ideas, it must be false.\" Pretentious human assertions are exalted above the clearest light, and light--heaven-sent light--is pronounced darkness.
