    "word": "My brother and sister, the Lord has sustained you thus far; and He will continue to work for and through you while you walk by faith. I am sorry that you do not have all the help that you feel you should have, but you must not be discouraged because of this. If you realize the greatness of the trust committed to you, you will do your best, and having done this, will leave the rest with your Heavenly Father. The Lord does not ask you to carry burdens that are too heavy for you. He is not ignorant of the cares that weigh upon you. He knows the barrenness of the fields. Again and again He has pointed out to us their great need. But you will not honor Him by being over anxious. Give to God your faithful service, and then leave to Him the work you are unable to perform. He can inspire others to work unselfishly and cheerfully \n\n\n                                    -410- \n\nin His service that these barren places may be filled with trees of righteousness.--Letter 18, 1912, pp. 2, 3. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, May 12, 1912.) \n\nReleased June 21, 1978.",
