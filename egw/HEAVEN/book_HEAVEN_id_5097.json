    "word": "Men who will not admit the claims of God's law, which are so very plain, will generally pursue a lawless course; for they have so long taken sides with the great rebel in warring against the law of God, \n182\nwhich is the foundation of his government in heaven and earth, that they are trained in this labor. In their warfare they will not open their eyes or consciences to light. They close their eyes, lest they shall become enlightened. Their case is as hopeless as was that of the Jews who would not see the light which Christ brought to them. The wonderful evidences which he gave them of his Messiahship, in the miracles that he performed, in healing the sick, raising the dead, and doing the works which no other man had done or could do, instead of melting and subduing their hearts, and overcoming their wicked prejudices, inspired them with satanic hatred and fury, such as Satan possessed when he was thrust out of heaven. The greater the light and evidence they had, the greater was their hatred. They were determined to extinguish the light by putting Christ to death.",
