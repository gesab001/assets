    "word": "Our Saviour came to this world to endure in human nature all the temptations wherewith man is beset. In His life He measured the power of the wily foe to deceive, to allure, and to destroy. As the Redeemer of the race, He warns humanity against seeking after those things that will lead away from the narrow path. He has cast up a glorious highway for those who are traveling toward the heavenly mansions that He has gone to prepare for all who will prepare themselves to become members of the royal family. . . .",
