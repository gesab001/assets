    "word": "Let every one who believes the truth empty himself of his selfishness and self-sufficiency, and his ambitious devising. Let the heavenly messengers empty themselves of the golden oil into the golden tubes, that it may flow into the golden bowls. Every church needs this golden oil; for their lamps are going out, when they should be bright and clear, sending forth to the world a shining light, that will penetrate the moral darkness which has covered the world like a funeral pall. If ever the anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth were needed, they are needed now.",
