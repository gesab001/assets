    "word": "Christ declared to the Pharisees, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I saw unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled. Whosoever \n\n\n                                     -154- \n\ntherefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven\" [Matthew 5:17-19].",
