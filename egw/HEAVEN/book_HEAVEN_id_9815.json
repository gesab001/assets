    "word": "Be merciful, even as your Father in heaven is merciful. Think of the great gift God has made for you. . . . God has given you a proof of His love that defies all computation. We have no line with which to measure it, no standard with which to compare it. God invites you to let your gratitude flow forth in gifts and offerings. He calls upon you to be His merciful helping hand. Can you refuse the request of One who has done so much for you?",
