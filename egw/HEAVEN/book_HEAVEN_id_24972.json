    "word": "It is our privilege to gather strength from the Lord, and to be fitting up characters for translation to heaven and to the mansions that He is preparing for us. We should be continually grateful for the power from above that has been promised us. Christ was that \"true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth\" [John 1:9-14].",
