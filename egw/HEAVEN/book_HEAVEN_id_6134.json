    "word": "MOSES AND ELIJAH.\u2014Moses upon the mount of transfiguration was a witness to Christ\u2019s victory over sin and death. He represented those who shall come from the grave at the resurrection of the just. Elijah, who had been translated to heaven without seeing death, represented those who will be living upon the earth at Christ\u2019s second coming, and who will be \u201cchanged, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump;\u201d when \u201cthis mortal must put on immortality,\u201d and \u201cthis corruptible must put on incorruption.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:51-53. Jesus was clothed with the light of heaven, as He will appear when He shall come \u201cthe second time without sin unto salvation.\u201d For He will come \u201cin the glory of His Father with the holy angels.\u201d Hebrews 9:28; Mark 8:38.",
