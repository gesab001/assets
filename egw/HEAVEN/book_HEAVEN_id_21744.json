Haskell\n\n     For some time the country had been suffering from a drought, but our cistern was only finished a few days when we had blessed showers from heaven which filled the tanks and half filled the large cistern. . . . After a few weeks another downpour of rain came, which filled the cistern to overflowing. If there is no more rain during this term the school has enough for all its needs. Thus the Lord has favored us.--Letter 132, 1897, pp. 1, 2. (To Mrs. Wessels, June 24, 1897.)",
