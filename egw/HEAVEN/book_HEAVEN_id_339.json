    "word": "Many such gatherings have been presented to me. I have seen the gaiety, the display in dress, the personal adornment.

With eating and drinking and merrymaking, they do their best to forget God. The scene of pleasure is their paradise. And Heaven is looking on, seeing and hearing all.",
