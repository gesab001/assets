    "word": "As souls born again, as our high and exalted birthright, we are never to venture to stoop to anything low, cheap, or questionable, never to be found in suspicious places, never to let our good be evil spoken of. As the heavens are higher than the earth, so much higher, purer, nobler, should be a Christian's ways above those of the sinner. Never need he apologize to the world because he dares to do righteousness.",
