    "word": "This present life is full of disappointment and trial, affliction and suffering. But let us ever remember that our Saviour is the greatest of all medical missionaries. He sympathizes with the members of the human family in their affliction. He wants us to trust in Him, believing His words so fully that we shall bring heaven into our lives here below. We can make heaven in heart and home as we pass along if our lives are hid with Christ in God. Thus we can bring joy and comfort into the lives of others. Christ's joy will remain in us, and our joy will be full.",
