    "word": "The Sixth Commandment Is Thoughtlessly Violated.-- To take one's life instantly is no greater sin in the sight of heaven than to destroy it gradually, but surely. Persons who bring upon themselves sure decay, by wrongdoing, will suffer the penalty here, and without a thorough repentance, will not be admitted into heaven hereafter any sooner than the one who destroys life \n                                                                           445\ninstantly. The will of God establishes the connection between cause and its effects.",
