    "word": "There was a scene presented to me. It was the night before the Sabbath. That is when that scene was presented. I looked out of the window, and there was an immense ball of fire that had come from heaven, and it fell where they were casting buildings with pillars, especially the pillars were presented to me. And it seemed as if the ball came right to the building and crushed it, and they saw that it was branching out, branching out, enlarging, and they began to cry and mourn and mourn, and wring their hands; and I thought some of our people stood by there, saying, \u201cWell, it is just what we have been expecting; it is just what we have been talking about; it is just what we have been talking about.\u201d \u201cYou knew it?\u201d said the people. \u201cYou knew it, and never told us about it?\u201d I thought there was such an agony in their face, such an agony in their appearance.",
