    "word": "Brethren and sisters, there are souls to save. And oh, when I think of those words in Daniel, I find myself waking up in the night and repeating them over and over, \"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever\" (Daniel 12:3). Look at the sun and the stars marshalled in the heavens and known by their names. The Lord says, \"They that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever.\" Well, now I want to know if you will fold your hands and take things easy? Will you sit down in the devil's easy chair, deceived, and say, \"I have always had an easy time and will take things easy now\"?",
