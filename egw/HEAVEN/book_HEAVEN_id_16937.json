    "word": "Pictures in Heaven's Record Books. Remember, your character is being daguerreotyped [photographed] by the great Master Artist in the record books of heaven, as minutely as the face is reproduced upon the polished plate of the artist. What do the books of heaven say in your case? Are you conforming your character to the Pattern, Jesus Christ? Are you washing your robes of character and making them white in the blood of the Lamb? \"Behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be\" [Revelation 22:12]. . . .",
