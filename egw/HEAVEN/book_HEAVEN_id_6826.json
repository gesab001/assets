    "word": "When I think of those words of Daniel, I find myself waking up in the night and repeating them over and over: \"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.\" Look at the sun and the stars marshaled in the heavens, and known by their names.
