    "word": "\"Swear not at all.\" Matthew 5:34. \n\n\n     The reason for this command is given: We are not to swear \"by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.\" R.V.",
