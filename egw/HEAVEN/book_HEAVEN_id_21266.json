    "word": "Bro. Reynolds fails to realize the sanctifying influence of the truth of God upon the heart. He is not patient, humble, and \n                                                                           91\nforbearing, as he should be. He is easily stirred. Self arises, and he says and does many things without due reflection, and he does not exert a saving influence at all times. If Bro. R. was imbued with the Spirit of Christ, he could with one hand take hold of the Mighty One, while with the hand of faith and love he would reach the poor sinner. Bro. R. needs the powerful influence of divine love, for this will renew and refine the heart, sanctify the life, and elevate and ennoble the entire man. Then his words and works will savor of Heaven rather than of his own spirit.",
