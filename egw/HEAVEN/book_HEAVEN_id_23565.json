    "word": "The Highest, who was with the Father before the world was, submitted to humiliation; He clothed His divinity with humanity that He might lift up the lowly. Prophecy lifts the veil that we may behold the throne of heaven, that we may see upon that throne, high and lifted up, One who in human form came to our world to suffer, to be lacerated with stripes and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed. He proclaims Himself the Advocate of the sinful human family. Before all the universe of heaven the Lord of glory suffered in human form, that His love, as a mighty Helper, might flow in rich currents to all suffering human beings. He \n\n\n                                   -214- \n\ncried out in His agony. He poured out His life on the cross for the one lost sheep.",
