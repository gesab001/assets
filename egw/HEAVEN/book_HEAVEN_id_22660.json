    "word": "MR No. 814 - Marriage and the Christian Home\n\n     Ellen White at Her Granddaughter's Wedding--You each [Dores E. Robinson and Ella M. White] have an identity of your own, but in that identity there must be a unity. There is constantly to be a development of the faculties that God has given you, that you may improve, improve, and that you may indeed be looked upon by the heavenly angels with commendation. We care more for that than everything else beside. Let the light of heaven shine right in the home--and we believe it will--in every word and in every action.",
