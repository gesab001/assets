    "word": "Jesus answered and said unto him, \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" He virtually said to Nicodemus, It is not controversy that will help your case. Arguments will not bring light to your soul. You must have a new heart, or you cannot discern the kingdom of heaven. It is not greater evidence that will bring you into a right position, but new purposes, new springs of action. You must be born again. Until this change takes place, until all things are made new, the strongest evidence that could be presented would be useless. The want is in your own heart; everything must be changed or you cannot see the kingdom of God.",
