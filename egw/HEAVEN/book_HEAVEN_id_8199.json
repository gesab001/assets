    "word": "The Lord's way is always the best way. We are safe while we follow Him who says, \"Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" If Christ, the Majesty of heaven, is meek and lowly, how much more ought we to be, who are under sentence of death for disobedience. The influence of our physicians in the sanitarium should be such as to encourage meekness and lowliness. Men are not be exalted as great and wonderful. It is God who is to be magnified.--Letter 51, 1900.",
