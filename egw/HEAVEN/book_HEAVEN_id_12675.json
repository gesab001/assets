    "word": "VIII. Christ Retains Human Nature Forever \n\n     In stooping to take upon Himself humanity, Christ revealed a character the opposite of the character of Satan. . . . In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.\" John 3:16. He gave Him not only to bear our sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-begotten Son to become one of the human family, forever to retain His human nature. This is the pledge that God will fulfill His word. \"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder.\" God has adopted human nature in the person of His Son, and has carried the same into the highest heaven.--Ibid., p. 25.",
