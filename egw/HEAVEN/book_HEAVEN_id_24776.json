    "word": "We are to be here only a little longer. Our citizenship is above. It will not unfit you for the earth to have a little more of heaven; it will afford you more enjoyment here, but you must draw near to God, and throw open the doors of your heart and let the sunlight of heaven in. How necessary that we put away iniquity. If we ever indulge it in our hearts, God will leave us. We want to hate sin as the hateful thing that it is. We want that change of heart, that purity of life, that when the world sees us it will know that we are not of them. They will know that we are not like the world. Our business transactions and all our conduct will be ennobling. Brethren and sisters, we need the converting power of God and His truth to light our hearts, that we may lead those who are around us to the light.",
