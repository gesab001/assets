    "word": "The Loving Watchcare of Jesus\n[PORTION\nOF A LETTER WRITTEN FEBRUARY 18, 1904, PUBLISHED IN\nNOTEBOOK LEAFLETS, CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE, NO. 1.]\n-\n\n     As I write I have a deep sense of gratitude for the loving watchcare of our Saviour over us all. As I read the Word of God and kneel in prayer, I am so impressed with the goodness and mercy of God that I cannot offer my petition without weeping. My heart is subdued and broken as I think of my heavenly Father's goodness and love. I hunger and thirst for more and still more of Jesus in this life. Christ was crucified for me, and shall I complain if I am crucified with Christ? . . .",
