    "word": "Battle Creek, Tuesday, Feb. 8, 1859. Cut and made some caps for Mother. It may be the last time I shall have the privilege of making caps for her head, but my prayer is that she may wear a crown of glory in the kingdom of heaven. Brother D. has been thrown down and beaten by drunken men. Two men \n\n\n                                     -140- \n\ninterfered. Brother D. complained of the men. They were shut up last night. They have their trial today. The same men struck my husband three times with a whip. Did not hurt him. The world is growing worse and worse.",
