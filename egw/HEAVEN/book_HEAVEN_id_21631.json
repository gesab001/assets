    "word": "Let Us Pray With Closed Eyes. It would seem that the ideas of believers praying with their eyes open, as though looking into heaven, is one of Satan's cheap fables, and the taking off the shoes when entering the house of worship is another production of his. The Lord is not pleased when His people, who have received such grand, noble truths from His word, allow their minds to dwell on the weak, silly fables which have been presented to me for my opinion. These deceived souls are told that Sister White prays with her eyes open. No; Sister White closes her eyes when she prays, that with spiritual vision she may behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.",
