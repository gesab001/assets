    "word": "Courage for the Task Came Through Power.--Nehemiah and Artaxerxes stood face to face,--the one a servant of a downtrodden race, the other the monarch of the world's great empire. But infinitely greater than the disparity of rank was the moral distance which separated them. Nehemiah had complied with the invitation of the King of kings, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me, and he shall make peace with Me.\" The silent petition that he sent up to heaven was the same that he had offered for many weeks, that God would prosper his request. And now, taking courage at the thought that he had a Friend, omniscient and omnipotent, to work in his behalf, the man of God made known to the king his desire for release for a time from his office at the court, and for authority to build up the waste places of Jerusalem, and make it once more a strong and defensed city. Momentous results to the Jewish city and nation hung upon this request. \"And,\" says Nehemiah, \"the king granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me.\"--Southern Watchman, March 8, 1904.",
