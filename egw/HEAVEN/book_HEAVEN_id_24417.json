    "word": "All who would gain heaven must follow the example of Him who gave His life to save an apostate race, to ransom men and women from eternal death. If the medical missionary workers will unite on the platform of truth with those who are carrying responsibilities in the cause of God, they will be gladly welcomed. But on no other platform than that which the Lord has laid can we unite with them. Never could we combine on any other basis. The foundation has been laid and all who will take their stand upon this platform, uniting wholeheartedly with the Lord's people, will be made welcome with rejoicing. But we cannot unite with those who choose to take their stand upon another foundation.",
