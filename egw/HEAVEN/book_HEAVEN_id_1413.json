    "word": "64\n \n     Control Yourself--We should not be discouraged if things of a trying nature arise.  Do not let your passion rise.  Control yourself.  When things occur which seem unexplainable, which do not appear to be in harmony with the great Counsel Book, do not allow your own peace to be spoiled.  Remember that there is a Witness, a heavenly Messenger, by your side, who is your shield, your fortress.  Into it you can run, and be safe.  But a word of retaliation will destroy your peace, and your confidence in God.  Who then is injured?--Yourself.  Who is grieved and wounded?--The Holy Spirit of God.",
