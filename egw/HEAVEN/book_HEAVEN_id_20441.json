    "word": "Again and again the heavenly messenger has been sent to the school. When his presence has been acknowledged, the darkness has fled away, and the light has shone forth, and hearts have been drawn to God. The last words spoken by Christ to John were, \"The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\" When we respond to God, and say, \"Lord, we come,\" then with joy will we draw water out of the wells of salvation. \n                                                                           19",
