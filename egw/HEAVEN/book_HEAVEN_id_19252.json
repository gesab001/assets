    "word": "God Gives to Us That We Might Give to Others.-- God imparts His blessing to us that we may impart to others. When we ask Him for our daily bread He looks into our hearts to see if we will share the same with those more needy than ourselves. When we pray \"God be merciful to me a sinner,\" He watches to see if we will manifest compassion toward those with whom we associate. This is the evidence of our connection with God, that we are merciful even as our Father in heaven is merciful.--Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 283, 284.",
