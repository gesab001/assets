    "word": "The cross speaks life, and not death, to the soul that believes in Jesus. Welcome the precious life-giving rays that shine from the cross of Calvary. Reach up for the blessing, believe for the blessing. Your Saviour, who died on the cross, is God's gift to a fallen world, and that gift embraces all heaven.",
