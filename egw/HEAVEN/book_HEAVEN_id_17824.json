    "word": "I am so thankful to my heavenly Father for His daily blessings to me. About a week ago, I felt completely worn out with the effort I had put forth in writing. My mind would not work, and I felt much depressed. I had almost given up hope of ever feeling rested again. But one night I prayed to God most earnestly for His strengthening, healing power to rest upon me, that I might be able to write out some things that ought to be published. I then went to sleep. In the night season I seemed to be speaking to different congregations, in regard to the healing, quickening power of the Holy Spirit. At half-past two I awoke. My headache was gone, and the soothing influence of the Spirit of God rested upon me. I walked the floor of my room, and praised God. I then took my pen in hand, and found that my mind was clear, and that I could write as well as ever. Since this experience, I have written a great deal. Our Saviour is the most skillful physician in the world. I praise Him for the marked blessing that He bestowed upon me at this time.",
