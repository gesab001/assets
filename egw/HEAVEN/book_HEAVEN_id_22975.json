    "word": "All heaven heard the challenge, \"He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, \n\n\n                                    -412- \n\nand we will believe Him\" [Matthew 27:42]. Never in outward appearance could humanity descend lower than this. But Satan saw that his disguise was torn away, that the character he had tried to fasten on Christ was fastened on himself. It was as if he had the second time fallen from heaven. He had acted out his own attributes. After the crucifixion, he saw that he had over reached himself. The charges he had made against Christ were made against God Himself.",
