    "word": "Christ in men unites them on one grand platform, preparing for the uniting in one family in heaven. It is the truth that makes men one, and removes national prejudice. God forbid that any one of us will plan and devise to keep up separate interests. Nothing but the quick and powerful word of God, working in the heart of His delegated messengers to give the knowledge of the glory of Christ, can gain victorious results, which are essential for the blending of hearts and minds that they may be of the same judgement, speaking the same things.",
