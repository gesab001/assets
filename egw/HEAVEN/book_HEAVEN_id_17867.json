    "word": "The sacred influences of present and past generations make a strong and powerful agency for God, able to stand, not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places. God's people of today have all the privileges and opportunities of former generations and increased light to make them more powerful in the work of God than the people of preceding generations have been. These advantages demand corresponding returns. In harmony with our heavenly treasures are to be our efforts to open the way before others.",
