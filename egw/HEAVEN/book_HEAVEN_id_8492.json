    "word": "Move Forward Steadily.--I want your ambition to be a sanctified ambition so that angels of God can inspire your heart with holy zeal, leading you to move forward steadily and solidly and making you a bright and shining light. Your perceptive faculties will increase in power and soundness if your whole being--body, soul, and spirit--is consecrated to the accomplishment of a holy work. Make every effort, in and through the grace of Christ, to attain to the high standard set before you. You \n\n104 \n\ncan be perfect in your sphere as God is perfect in His sphere. Has not Christ declared, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\" (Matthew 5:48)?--Lt 123, 1904.",
