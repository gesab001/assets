    "word": "The students of the Huntsville School are to be given a training in many lines of service. All are to be taught the importance of practical Christianity. And they are to learn how to present the truth for this time to their own people. Not only are they to learn to do public work, but they should learn also the special value of house-tohouse work in soul-saving. In carrying forward work among the colored people, it is not learned men, not eloquent men, who are now the most needed, but humble men who in the school of Christ have learned to be meek and lowly, and who will go forth into the highways and hedges to give the invitation, \u201cCome; for all things are now ready.\u201d Those who beg at midnight for loaves for hungry souls will be successful. It is a law of heaven that as we receive, we are to impart.",
