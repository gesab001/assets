    "word": "Two Lessons \n\n     If the soul is to be purified and ennobled, and made fit for the heavenly courts, there are two lessons to be learned-- self-sacrifice and self-control. Some learn these important lessons more easily than do others, for they are exercised by the simple discipline the Lord gives them in gentleness and love. Others require the slow discipline of suffering, that the cleansing fire may purify their hearts of pride and self-reliance, of earthly passion and self-love, that the true gold of character may appear and that they may become victors through the grace of Christ.",
