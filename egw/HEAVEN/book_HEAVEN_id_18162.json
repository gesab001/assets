To them had been given the assurance, \u201cIf I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land\u201d (2 Chronicles 7:13, 14). It was to bring to pass this blessed result that God continued to withhold from them the dew and the rain until a decided reformation should take place.\u2014Ibid., p. 128.",
