    "word": "Personal piety can only bear its testimony in a wise and unconditional surrender to God. It can only be obtained by asking of God. We are to shut our doors to all outward activity, and kneel before our Maker. Away from human beings, we are to consider our duty in the light of the Word of God. \"I pray not,\" said Christ in His prayer to the Father, \"that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil\" (John 17:15). The soul that seeks after God will find Him. And the life \n\n\n                                   -373- \n\nwill be full of goodness, love, and truth. The conversation will be of heaven, from whence we look for our Saviour. Our religion will tell, in its influence, in our personal deeds [1 John 3:10-22; 2:4-7 quoted.]",
