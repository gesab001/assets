    "word": "\"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" Do not bring to the foundation that which is represented as wood, hay, and stubble; for such material will be destroyed by fire. Bring the material that is spoken of in the word of God, as gold, silver, and precious stones. This will stand the test. If you bring worthless material to the foundation, your work will be consumed. Although you may save your own soul, you will have nothing to show for your life-work. God desires you not merely to save your own soul \n                                                                           12\nbut to bring others to Him, who, when the redeemed are gathered home, will be among those who will cast their glittering crowns at the feet of the Redeemer, and fill all heaven with rich music. These ransomed ones will exclaim, \"Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and that sitteth upon the throne;\" and then they will go to the ones who spoke to them the words which brought them into right relation to God, and will say, \"It was your influence, through Christ, that led me to accept the truth of heavenly origin.\"",
