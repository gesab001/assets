    "word": "This testimony may be borne of all who will resist temptation, who will educate themselves to respect themselves, not as lords, but as human beings, whose redemption cost heaven an infinite price. They are to cut loose from the slavery of Satan's power, and look upon themselves as too precious and valuable to descend to any cheap ideas or common mean practices, and so dishonor body and soul that the Lord is ashamed to call them brethren. They are to reverence themselves by reverencing God, who gave Jesus to ransom them. Thus they may make of themselves, through Christ, powerful, consecrated workmen, who can cooperate with God in the great work of restoring in man the moral image of God. In order to understand and reverence themselves, they must reverence God. This will give them correct ideas of their entire dependence upon God. Then they may be called sons of God, and angels will dwell amongst them.--Manuscript 40, 1896, pp. 10, 11, 12. (\"The Workers Needed in Cooranbong,\" December 31, 1896.)",
