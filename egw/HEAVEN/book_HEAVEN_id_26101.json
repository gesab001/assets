    "word": "The Lord says, to all, Purify your souls from all commonness. Set before your children and households an example in word and deportment that will lead them to desire above all things to render to God consecrated loving service. Pray for your home; instruct your family, sanctify the Lord God of Israel in your hearts and in your lives. I am deeply pained as I see with some a spirit of carelessness in speech and deportment. This is a hindrance to spirituality. The Lord declared to Israel. \"What doth the Lord require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all His ways, and (943) to love Him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, and to keep the commandments of the Lord, and His statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good. Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the Lord's thy God, the earth also, and all that therein is. Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.\" Read these words thoughtfully, and consider how great are the privileges of the people whom the Lord chose to serve Him. To all connected with sacred duties I am charged to say, Seek the Lord. Take heed to your conversation; lay off all cheapness of speech; for the Lord would have you become intelligent workers and wise counsellors. Let those with whom you associate see nothing of frivolity in your words and works. You have the knowledge of sacred truth, and you are to honor those truths as men and women who must give an account for the talents entrusted to them. \n\n\n                              -572-",
