    "word": "There is something peculiarly sacred in the human voice. Its harmony and its subdued and heaven-inspired pathos exceeds every musical instrument. Vocal music is one of God's gifts to men, an instrument that cannot be surpassed or equalled when God's love abounds in the soul. Singing with the spirit and the understanding also is a great addition to devotional services in the house of God.",
