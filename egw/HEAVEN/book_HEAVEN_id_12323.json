The other leads into the broad road, where man can easily go \n                                                                           1096\nwith his burden of sin and corruption, but it leads to perdition (MS 50, 1898).  {5BC 1095.10} \n     (Ch. 12:30; Luke 11:23.) Living for Self Dishonors Redeemer.-- Christians who live for self dishonor their Redeemer. They may apparently be very active in the service of the Lord, but they weave self into all that they do. Sowing the seeds of selfishness, they must at last reap a harvest of corruption. . . . Service for self takes a variety of forms. Some of these forms seem harmless. Apparent goodness gives them the appearance of genuine goodness. But they bring no glory to the Lord. By their service His cause is hindered. Christ says, \"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\"",
