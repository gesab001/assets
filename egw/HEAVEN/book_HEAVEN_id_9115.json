    "word": "God is a vigilant observer of the actions of the children of men. Nothing occurs in earth or heaven without the knowledge of the Creator. Nothing can happen without His permission. He on whom the fate of an empire may depend is watched over with a vigilance which knows no relaxation by Him who \"giveth salvation unto kings,\" to whom belong \"the shields of the earth.\" And the poor man is as tenderly watched over as the monarch upon his throne.",
