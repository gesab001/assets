    "word": "God will help us as ministers to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called. He will help us to strengthen one another in the most holy faith. At times I am in an agony of distress over the indifference our ministers manifest toward God's instruction to His ambassadors to close the windows of the soul earthward and open them heavenward, that the light flooding heaven's threshold may shine into the chambers of every mind. When the mind is filled with the light of heaven, the human agent is given power to reach the hearts of others.--Ms 127, 1902, pp. 2, 8. (\"Words to Ministers,\" Talk, September 16, 1902.)",
