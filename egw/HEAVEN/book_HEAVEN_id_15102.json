    "word": "\"I DREAMED THAT THE FOLLOWING WAS THE INTERPRETATION: THE LAMPS REPRESENTED THE REMNANT PEOPLE. THE OIL WAS THE TRUTH AND HEAVENLY LOVE, OF WHICH GOD'S PEOPLE NEED A CONSTANT SUPPLY.

THE LATTER WERE IN GREAT DISTRESS FOR A SEASON, BUT WERE AT LAST DELIVERED BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THEIR OWN EARNEST EFFORTS. THEN FINALLY THE POWER OF GOD RESTED UPON THEM, AND THEY ACTED A PROMINENT PART IN THE PROCLAMATION OF THE LAST MESSAGE OF MERCY. BUT SISTER WHITE HAD A RICHER SUPPLY OF HEAVENLY WISDOM AND LOVE THAN THE REST.",
