    "word": "And when the light of divine truth shines forth with distinctness from the words and works of God's children, will there be seen any quarreling, any backbiting, among the lightbearers? The world will see no dissension in the lives of those from whom the light of heaven is shed abroad. Brethren and sisters, as you let your light shine before men, they will \"see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" A precious influence will go forth as the result of these good works, that will bring salvation to those who behold it. God desires that we shall keep our light constantly shining.",
