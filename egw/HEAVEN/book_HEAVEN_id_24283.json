    "word": "Christ read the hearts of the Pharisees, who were bracing themselves to resist the light. Their prejudice against Him was strengthening; they were saying in their hearts, He is doing away [with] the law; we will have no such teaching. But while they were bottling up their wrath, there fell on their startled ears the answer to their unspoken thought: Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill (every specification of the law). For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle will in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven\" [Matthew 5:17-19].",
