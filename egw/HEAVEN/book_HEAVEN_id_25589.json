    "word": "This place, Palmerston, is an important railway center. We must seek wisdom of God, for by faith I see a strong church in that city. Our work must be to watch, and to pray, to seek counsel of the One Wonderful and Mighty in council. One mightier than the strongest powers of hell can take the prey from Satan, and under his guidance the angels of heaven will carry on the battle against all the powers of darkness, and plant the standard of truth and righteousness in that city.",
