    "word": "The desire of our lord is that we should be so watching that when he cometh and knocketh, we may open to him immediately. A blessing is pronounced upon those servants that he finds watching. \"He will gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.\" Who among us in these last days will be thus especially honored by the Master of assemblies? Are we prepared without delay to open to him immediately and welcome the Master? Watch, watch, watch. This watching and waiting, ready, all ready to welcome our Lord, has ceased with nearly all. We are not ready to open to him immediately. The love of the world has occupied our thoughts, and so filled our minds that our eyes are turned downward to the earth, but not upward. We are hurrying about, engaged in different enterprises, with zeal and earnestness, and God is forgotten, and the heavenly treasure is now valued. We are not in a waiting, watching position. The love of the world and the deceitfulness of riches eclipses our faith, and we do not long for, and love, the appearing of our Saviour. We do too much ourselves, to take care of self. \n                                                                           20\nWe are uneasy, distrustful, and greatly lack a firm trust in God. Many worry and work, and contrive and plan, fearing they suffer need. They cannot afford time to pray, or to attend religious meetings, and in their care for themselves, leave no chance for God to care for them. The Lord does not to do much for them, for they give him no opportunity. The do too much for themselves, and believe and trust too little in God.",
