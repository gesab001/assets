    "word": "Said Christ of the unbelieving Jews, \u201cIf I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin.\u201d [John 15:22.] The same divine power had spoken through Luther to the emperor and princes of Germany. And as the light shone forth from God's Word, his Spirit pleaded for the last time with many in that assembly. As Pilate, centuries before, permitted pride and popularity to close his heart against the world's Redeemer; as the \n165\ntrembling Felix bade the messenger of truth, \u201cGo thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee;\u201d [Acts 24:25.] as the proud Agrippa confessed, \u201cAlmost thou persuadest me to be a Christian,\u201d [Acts 26:28.] yet turned away from the Heaven-sent message,\u2014so had Charles V., yielding to the dictates of worldly pride and policy, decided to reject the light of truth.",
