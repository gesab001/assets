    "word": "When the believer is united with Christ, that faith is manifested in holiness of character, in consistent obedience to every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. The truths which we receive from the Word of God are truths which reach to heaven and compass eternity, and yet the vital influence of those truths may be woven into the human life. The influence of the Word of God is to have a sanctifying effect on our speech, our actions, our association with every member of the family, and with strangers. The leaven of truth must bring under control the temper and the voice. In the home and in the church there are matters which are termed \"little things,\" but all these little things have great results. It is the \"little things\" that discipline the soul and prepare men to act with lowly-mindedness in large responsibilities.",
