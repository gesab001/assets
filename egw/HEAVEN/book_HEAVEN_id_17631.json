    "word": "Now let us improve the precious opportunities to become acquainted with our heavenly Father, who \"so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish. . . .\" Wondrous love that God, the infinite God, has made it our privilege to approach Him by the name of Father! No earthly parent could plead more earnestly with an erring child than He who made us pleads with the transgressor. No human, loving interest has ever followed the impenitent with such tender invitations. . . .",
