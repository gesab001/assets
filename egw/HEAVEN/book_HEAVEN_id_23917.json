    "word": "Prevailing Prayer. Our Lord watches over His sheep and lambs by day and by night, and it is not the will of our heavenly Father that even one of His little ones should perish. The work was enjoined upon Peter, Feed My lambs; feed My sheep. Great is the love of our heavenly Father for every soul for whom Christ has died. In the parable [Luke 11:5-8] the one who asked was for a time refused, but afterward he was given as much as he needed. But the Lord says, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find.\" You need not fear an improper hour. His eye never slumbers nor sleeps. He always hears the prayer of the humble suppliant and grants His blessing. He never turns away unblessed those who seek Him with the whole heart.",
