    "word": "The lips that have uttered perverse things of God's delegated servants and have scorned the message they have borne, have put darkness for light, and light for darkness. Instead of watching, as did the Pharisees, for something to condemn in the message or the messengers, something to scoff at and deride, had they opened their hearts to the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, they would have been offering grateful praise rather than watching for something which they could misinterpret or twist so as to find fault with. O, when the first ray of light shone upon them, if they had only praised God that the heaven sent message was truth, then more and clearer light would have shone into the chambers of the mind and into the soul-temple. \n                                                                           1310",
