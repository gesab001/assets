    "word": "O, if I could but see the depth of experience coming to our people which they must have before they can enter heaven, then would I be filled with grateful thanksgiving to God! I speak to our people, ministers, physicians, and all who profess to believe the truth. A work of thorough conversion needs to be done. Walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Why do we not take heed? The Lord has long waited for us as a people who know the truth, to make that truth known to all possible who will hear and be converted. \n\n\n                               (Signed) \n\n\n                                     Ellen G.
