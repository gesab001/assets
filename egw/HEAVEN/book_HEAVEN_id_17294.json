    "word": "The Lord brought His people out of Egypt in a victorious manner. He led them through the wilderness to prove them, and try them. He repeatedly manifested His miraculous power in their deliverances from their enemies. He promised to take them to Himself, as His peculiar treasure, if they would obey His voice, and keep His commandments. He did not forbid them to eat the flesh of animals, but withheld it from them in a great measure. He provided them food which was the most healthful. He rained their bread from heaven, and gave them purest water from the flinty rock. He made a covenant with them, if they would obey Him in all things, He would preserve them from disease.",
