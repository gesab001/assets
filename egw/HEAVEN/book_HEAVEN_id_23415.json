    "word": "Now, if those who were to engage in running a race for earthly honor were obliged to submit themselves to such severe discipline in order to succeed, how much more necessary it is for those who are to engage in the work of the Lord to be thoroughly disciplined and prepared if they would succeed in that which they undertake.

The road to success is not a smooth way over which we are borne in rail cars, but it is a rugged path, filled with obstacles which can be surmounted only by patient toil.",
