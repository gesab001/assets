    "word": "Christ, the Commander of all heaven, One with God, clothed His divinity with humanity, that humanity might touch humanity. He humbled himself, taking up His abode on the earth, that He might become acquainted with the temptations and trials wherewith man is beset. He placed Himself among the poor, that as a human being, He might understand their affliction. Before the heavenly universe, He unfolded the great salvation that His righteousness would bring to men, if they would accept it,--an inheritance among the saints and angels, in the presence of God.",
