    "word": "Prove your willingness to make every effort in your power to place your children in the most favorable situation for forming the character that God requires his servants to form. Exercise every spiritual sinew and muscle to save your little flock. The powers of hell will conspire for your destruction. Pray much more than you do. Lovingly, tenderly teach your children to come to God as a heavenly Father. By your example in the management of the home, teach them self-control. Teach them to be helpful in the home. Tell them that Christ lived not to please himself. The Holy Spirit will fill your mind with the most precious thoughts as you work for your own salvation and the salvation of your Children.",
