    "word": "In order to secure us to Himself and ensure our eternal salvation He gave all that He had--His riches, His glory, and His own precious life. For us He endured the agony of the Garden of Gethsemane, when the mysterious cup trembled in His hand and His anguished soul cried out, \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me.\" From His pale, quivering lips came this anguished prayer, and then the words of submission, \"O My Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me except I drink it, Thy will be done.\" An angel from heaven strengthened the royal Sufferer to tread His blood-stained path to Calvary, and to drink the cup of suffering to its very dregs. Oh, why was all this suffering, this ignominy, and torturing agony? It was that by this sacrifice of Himself His love might stand revealed, that He might woo men from the ways of sin. After man has cost so much, will He leave him now? Oh no, no! He is faithful that has promised; His arms are outstretched to clasp the repentant, believing ones to His heart of love, with all the tenderness of divine affection. In Jesus we have an enduring, unchanging friend, and though all earthly prospects should fail and every earthly friend prove treacherous, yet He is faithful still.",
