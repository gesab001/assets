Angels came to receive the King of glory, and to escort him triumphantly to heaven. After \n                                                                           78\nJesus had blessed his disciples, he was parted from them, and taken up. And as he led the way upward, the multitude of captives who were raised at his resurrection followed. A multitude of the heavenly host was in attendance; while in heaven an innumerable number of angels awaited his coming. As they ascended up to the holy city, the angels who escorted Jesus cried out, Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. With rapture the angels in the city, who awaited his coming, cried out, Who is this King of glory? The escorting angels with triumph answered, The Lord strong and mighty! The Lord mighty in battle! Lift up your heads, O ye gates! even lift them up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Again the heavenly host cried out, Who is this King of glory? The escorting angels in melodious strains answered, The Lord of hosts! He is the King of glory! And the heavenly train passed into the city. Then all the heavenly host surrounded the Son of God, their majestic commander, and with the deepest adoration bowed, casting their glittering crowns at his feet. And then they touched their golden harps, and in sweet, melodious strains, filled all heaven with their rich music and songs to the Lamb who was slain, yet lives again in majesty and glory. \n                                                                           79",
