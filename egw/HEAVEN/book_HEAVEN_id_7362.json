    "word": "In Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Creator; and the prophecy brings to view a class that, as the result of the threefold message, are keeping the commandments of God. One of these commandments points directly to God as the Creator. The fourth precept declares: \"The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: . . . for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it\" (Exodus 20:10, 11). Concerning the Sabbath, the Lord says, further, that it is \"a sign, . . . that ye may know that I am the Lord your God\" (Ezekiel 20:20). And the reason given is: \"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed\" (Exodus 31:17). . . .",
