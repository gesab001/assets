    "word": "We can afford to toil here, afford to be pilgrims and strangers. If I lose heaven, I lose everything. Oh, I do want to see Jesus and live in His presence, and I do want you should see Him. We should see Him together, praise Him together, be crowned together. We will live wholly for God. We will make most earnest efforts for the crown of life. We will seek to get all into glory, we can, that we may enter with the joy of our Lord.",
