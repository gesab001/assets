    "word": "Everyone who has to deal with others should make their case his own; for just as we deal with others will God deal with us. We are treating Christ as we treat His children; for He is represented in the person of His saints. The truth of God must sanctify the soul, refine and elevate the character, and we must obtain the heavenly mold, before we shall be fitted for the courts above.",
