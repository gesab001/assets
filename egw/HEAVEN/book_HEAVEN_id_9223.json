    "word": "To those who comply with the conditions, \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the unclean,\" God's promise is, \"I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty\" (2 Corinthians 6:17, 18). It is the privilege and the duty of every Christian to have a rich and abundant experience in the things of God. . . . The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness shine upon the servants of God, and they are to reflect His rays. As the stars tell us that there is a great light in heaven with whose glory they are made bright, so Christians are to make it manifest that there is a God on the throne of the universe whose character is worthy of praise and imitation. The graces of His Spirit, the purity and holiness of His character, will be manifest in His witnesses. . . .",
