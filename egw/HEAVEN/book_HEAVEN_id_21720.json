    "word": "My dear brethren and sisters in Iowa, determine to reveal Christ's righteousness more fully than you have revealed it in the past; determine to show that you are not of this world, but of the kingdom of heaven. You are in danger of losing a rich experience. Will you not cultivate the grace of Christ in your hearts? Let not selfishness, springing from self-love, separate you from one another and from God. Bind yourselves to one another by the cords of Christian benevolence. If faithful, you will hear from the Saviour's lips the words, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"--Letter 134, 1902, p. 8. (To \"Dear Brethren and Sisters of the Iowa Conference.\" Copied Aug. 27, 1902.) \n\nReleased April 6, 1965.",
