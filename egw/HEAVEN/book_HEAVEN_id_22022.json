    "word": "In the night season messages have been given to me to give to you in Battle Creek, and to all our schools. While it is in the order of God that the physical powers shall be trained as well as the mental, yet the physical exercise should in character be in complete harmony with the lessons given by Jesus Christ to His disciples. That which is given to the world should be seen in the lives of Christians; so that in education and in self-training the heavenly intelligences should not record in the books that the students and the teachers in our schools are \"lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.\"--Ms 51, 1893, pp. 1, 2. (To teachers and students of Battle Creek College and all educational institutions, December, 1893.)",
