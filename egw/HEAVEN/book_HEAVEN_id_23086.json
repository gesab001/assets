    "word": "MR No. 1051 - Vision at Paris, Maine\n\n     We were united in praying last evening for the Spirit of the Lord to fall upon us. God heard our earnest cries. I was taken off in vision. I saw how great and holy God was. Said the angel, \"Walk carefully before Him, for He is high and lifted up, and the train of His glory fills the temple.\" I saw that everything in heaven was in perfect order. Said the angel, \"Look ye; Christ is the head; move in order, move in order. Have a meaning to everything.\" Said the angel, \"Behold ye, and know how perfect, how beautiful, the order in heaven; follow it.\" Then I saw that the paper [Review and Herald] would go and that it would be the means of bringing souls to a knowledge of the truth. I saw that James had not borne the burden alone but that the angels of God had assisted and had oversight of the paper.",
