    "word": "During the night I have been in communion with God. I have been brought by my guide into councils in Battle Creek, and I have a message to bear to you whether you will hear or not, whether you will receive it or reject it. The people must know that they are not moving in the order of God. They have left Christ out of their councils. Leading men are giving a mold to the work that will result in a loss of many souls; for they are moving away from the safe path. Many come here from foreign countries, thinking that Battle Creek, from whence come the publications of truth, will be next to heaven. How disappointed they feel, when they hear in this place, the message of God spoken of lightly, when they hear the messengers of God, by some in responsible places, made a subject of ridicule, and why is this? It is because the message of the messengers does not coincide in every particular with the ideas of these whom the Lord names of his scorners, although it is a message sent from heaven.",
