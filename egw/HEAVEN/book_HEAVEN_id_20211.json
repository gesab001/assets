    "word": "Eld. Fuller has heard the testimony borne in public, that the professed people of God were not all holy; some were corrupt. God \n                                                                           21\nwas seeking to elevate them, but they refused to come up upon a high plane of action. The animal passions bore sway, and the moral and intellectual were overborne, and made servants to the corrupt passions. Those who do not control their base passions cannot appreciate the atonement, or place right value upon the worth of the soul. Salvation to them is not experienced nor understood. The gratification of their animal passions is to them the highest ambition of their lives. Nothing but purity and holiness will God accept; one spot, one wrinkle, one defect in the character, will debar Heaven, with all its glories and treasure, from them forever.",
