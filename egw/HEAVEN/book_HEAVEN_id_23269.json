    "word": "God calls upon his people to be converted, to become humble as a little child, that they may have childlike faith. Those who have grown hard and cold and unimpressionable, may have the form of godliness but they have lost the virtue that keeps the mind humble. \"Blessed are the poor in the spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\" Remove from the heart that criticizing spirit. God hates it. Those who yield to this spirit have given themselves up to do Satan's work, and he stands by exulting.--Manuscript 165, 1898, pp. 6-9. (Written December 13, 1898, \"Unity a Test of Discipleship.\")",
