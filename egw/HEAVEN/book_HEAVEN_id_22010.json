    "word": "I had great freedom in talking upon faith, that faith and feeling should not be confounded together. They are distinct as the east is from the west. In the darkest hours it is then we should exercise faith, and not suffer our feelings to govern us, but press our faith through the dark clouds to the throne of God and claim the blessing of heaven. When our faith grasps the blessing, then the blessing is ours, for our faith has got hold of it, and when our faith brings the blessing down to us--when the dark clouds scatter and divine rays of light from Jesus illumine our darkness--then it is no more \n\n\n                                   -207- \n\nfaith, it is feeling. The evidence has come and it is feeling that has swallowed up the faith. This view of faith and feeling seemed to enlighten some minds and we had a most powerful conference meeting.--Letter 4, 1854, pp. 1, 2. (To \"Dear Friends,\" October 12, 1854.) \n\nReleased September 15, 1972.",
