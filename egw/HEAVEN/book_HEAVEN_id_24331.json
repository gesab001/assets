    "word": "Well, I think my labors here in public speaking are now ended. I must yet labor with the church, then I leave them until the judgment, never expecting to see their faces again after I leave them. Oh, what will be our meeting then? Will it be with fullness of joy and hope? Oh, God grant that it may be so! If we can meet Jesus in peace and be saved, forever saved, we shall be the happiest of beings! Oh, to be at home at last where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest! Heaven, sweet heaven! Oh, I shall appreciate heaven! I know that I must watch and keep my garments unspotted from the world or I shall never enter the abode of the blessed.",
