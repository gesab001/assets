    "word": "Some claim that the  commandments are not binding on those who are led by the Spirit. \"What spirit?\" we inquire. Certainly not the Spirit of Christ; for He declared, \"I came not to destroy the law.\" \"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,\" He said, \"and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.\" He is a rebel against God's government. He is sinning himself, and is leading others in the path of disobedience. \"He shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven.\" For him there will be no place in God's kingdom. He is a transgressor of God's law, and into the holy city no transgressors are admitted.",
