    "word": "In the market of which divine mercy has the management, the precious pearl is represented as being bought without money and without price. In this market all may obtain the goods of heaven. The treasury of the jewels of truth is open to all. . . . The Saviour's voice earnestly and lovingly invites us: \"I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich.\" . . . The poorest are as well able as the richest to purchase salvation; for no amount of worldly wealth can secure it. It is obtained by willing obedience, by giving ourselves to Christ as His own purchased possession. . . .",
