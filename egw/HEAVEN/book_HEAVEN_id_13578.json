    "word": "These precious truths Jesus declared to the incredulous multitude, saying, \"All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of Him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, \n                                                                           279\nmay have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\"",
