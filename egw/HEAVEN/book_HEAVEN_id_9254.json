    "word": "Faith and love are the essential, powerful, working elements of Christian character. Those who possess them are one with Christ, and are carrying forward His mission. . . . We are to sit at Christ\u2019s feet as continual learners, and to work with His gifts of faith and love. We shall then wear Christ\u2019s yoke, and lift His burdens, and Christ will recognize us as one with Him; in heaven it will be said, \u201cYe are labourers together with God.\u201d Will our youth remember that without faith it is impossible to please God? and it must be faith that works by love and purifies the soul.",
