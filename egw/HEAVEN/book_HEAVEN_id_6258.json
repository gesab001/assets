    "word": "Harmful Effects of Impure Air. \n     317. The harmful effects of living in close, ill-ventilated rooms are these: The system becomes weak and unhealthy; the circulation is depressed; the blood moves sluggishly through the system, because it is not purified and vitalized by the pure, invigorating air of heaven; the mind becomes depressed and gloomy, while the whole system is enervated, and fevers and other acute diseases are liable to be generated.--T., V. I, p. 702. \n                                                                           73",
