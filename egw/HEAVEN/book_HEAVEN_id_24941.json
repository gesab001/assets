    "word": "I love my Saviour just as much today as I loved Him then. I have passed through much sadness and suffering. Only about a week ago I feared that I might be a cripple for the remainder of my life. Physical infirmities that I have had for twenty-five years began to trouble me, and I knew not but that I should soon be a helpless cripple. But I kept praying for strength. I prayed, \"I will keep my petition before Thee, Thou Lord of heaven, until Thou wilt remove the difficulty.\" And I am glad to be able to say this morning, to His praise, that He answered my prayer. Dr. Kellogg wrote to me that he had sent by express an appliance for me to use in connection with the electric-light bath, by means of which he hoped I might obtain some relief; but the difficulty is removed.",
