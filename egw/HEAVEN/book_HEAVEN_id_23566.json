    "word": "And all heaven is enlisted in beseeching Christ's laborers to recover the guilty sheep that was lost. The lost sheep must be recovered. All the resources of heaven are at the command of the interested workers, that they may bestow them upon perishing souls. The Word declares that the Father has given all heaven in the great gift of His Son to seek and save that which was lost. \n     [Zephaniah 3:16-20, quoted.]",
