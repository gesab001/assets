    "word": "The work of the Christian physician is to bear on its face the signature of self-denial, and not have even the appearance of fraud and extortion. It has become general among physicians who have not the fear of God before them, to hide that which is plain and simple under the guise of mystery in order \n                                                                           211\nthat they may have more influence with the people. But this is not after Christ's order. God alone is veiled in unapproachable mystery. When dealing with humanity, Jesus made every dark thing plain to the understanding of men, and promised at His ascension to send the Comforter, whose office work was to reveal truth. In heaven's courts fraud and dishonesty in the physician is known by the same term as fraud and extortion in the merchant or mechanic. Overcharges on the part of a physician for rendering some simple service to an unfortunate brother, is just as much grinding the face of the poor as when a lawyer demands exorbitant fees for his service, or a merchant requires an unreasonable price for his goods.",
