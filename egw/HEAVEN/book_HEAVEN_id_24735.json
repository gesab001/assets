    "word": "And, dear brethren, in your different positions in your fields of labor there is not that feeling of love and tenderness cultivated that there ought to be. Love is a tender, heavenly plant that needs constant cultivation. We meet here in this conference as a family of God's chosen ones, and as we are God's children we will have nothing in us that will love strife or love to quarrel one with another. We should be guarded, not to tear down that which our brethren or ourselves have been building up. When you are disposed to dissension, think that it will not do, it will not do.",
