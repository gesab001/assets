    "word": "Following a prayer by Brother Crisler, she prayed: \"Heavenly Father, I come to Thee, weak, like a broken reed, yet by the Holy Spirit's vindication of righteousness and truth that shall prevail. I thank Thee, Lord, I thank Thee, and I will not draw away from anything that shall prevail. Let thy light, let thy joy and peace, be upon me in my last hours, that I may glorify Thee, is my greatest desire; and this is all that I shall ask of Thee. Amen.\"",
