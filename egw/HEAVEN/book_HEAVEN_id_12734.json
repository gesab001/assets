    "word": "Shaking of the powers of Heaven\n     Dec. 16, 1848, the Lord gave me a view of the shaking of the powers of the heavens. I saw that when the Lord said \u201cheaven\u201d (in giving the signs recorded by Matthew, Mark and Luke,) he meant heaven, and when he said \u201cearth\u201d he meant earth. The powers of heaven are the Sun, Moon and Stars. They rule in the heavens. The powers of earth are \n24\nthose who bear rule on the earth. The powers of heaven will be shaken at the voice of God. Then the Sun, Moon and Stars will be moved out of their places. They will not pass away, but be shaken by the voice of God.",
