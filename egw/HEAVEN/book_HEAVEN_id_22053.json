    "word": "Children, let your light shine forth to others. If you live only for yourselves, the heavenly benediction of \"Well done\" will not be yours. We must not live for self, but to be a blessing to others. The heart unrefreshed with the dew and rain of heaven becomes distrustful, discontented. Both God's mercies and judgments are alike misinterpreted and unimproved. There is not a walking in the light. He that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. He forgets that he is a steward of the grace of Christ. If we as a people have the truth, as we believe without a doubt we have, there is no time to be lost. We must work to get the message of warning before all we possibly can. Ministers have a work to do. Laymen cannot meet the accountability and be idle. . . . \n\n\n                                     -315-",
