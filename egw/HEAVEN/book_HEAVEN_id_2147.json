    "word": "Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those who are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, at the very entrance of their Christian life declare publicly that they have forsaken the service of Satan and have become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. They have obeyed the command: \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the unclean thing.\" And to them is fulfilled the promise: \"I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\" 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.",
