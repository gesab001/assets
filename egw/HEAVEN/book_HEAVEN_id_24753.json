    "word": "We have washed our character and made it white in the blood of the Lamb. We must have an intense anxiety to separate evil from us. If we lose heaven we lose everything, and if we gain heaven we gain everything. We will not only have eternal life in the kingdom of glory but eternal riches forevermore. Therefore we should have a deep interest in these things. Why, the time is coming when the teachings of Christ will be made of none effect. From the minister in the desk you will hear, \"Peace, peace; there is to be a temporal millennium first before Christ will come.\" But what we want is the Bible.",
