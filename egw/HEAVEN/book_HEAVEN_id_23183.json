    "word": "(Diary Entry for Dec. 6, 1904, Los Angeles, Calif.) I cannot sleep this morning after twelve o'clock [midnight]. I am grateful to my heavenly Father that I am entirely free from pain this morning. Yet I am weak. I am drawn out in prayer to my heavenly Father for increased strength that I may present to the people the most precious and essential truth for this time and entreat all to preserve the old landmarks that have been searched out and, under the demonstration of the Holy Spirit, proclaimed to the world. Many wonderful miracles have been worked in the searching for the truth as for hidden treasure, and the golden treasures of the Word have been substantiated by such remarkable demonstration of the Holy Spirit that all who have had an experience in the work of God since the Bible was opened to our understanding would be sinning against the Holy Ghost to deny the truth.",
