    "word": "I understand that you are to labor in England. This country has been presented to me several times as a field that required men who will not fail nor be discouraged, men who will co-operate with the heavenly intelligences. But I saw that one great hindrance to the advancement of the work has been, and will be, that those placed in position of trust feel that of themselves they could manage the work; that they have ability and they want to sway everything their way. Among the workers there is much of self, that lives, and refuses to die. Now this self wants the supremacy, but if it is allowed to rule, the work will be marred, losses will occur, and there will be a revealing of self in management, and mistakes will be made.",
