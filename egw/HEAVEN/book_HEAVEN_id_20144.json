    "word": "Christ is represented as hunting, searching for the sheep that was lost. It is his love that encircles us, bringing us back to the fold, giving us the privilege of sitting together with him in heavenly places. When the blessed light of the Sun of Righteousness shines into our hearts, and we rest in peace and joy in the Lord, then let us praise the Lord: praise him who is the health of our countenance, and our God. Let us praise him not in words only, but by the consecration to him of all that we are and all that we have.",
