    "word": "Elmshaven, Nov. 26, 1902. This day I am 75 years old. I thank my heavenly Father that I have the use of all my faculties. I can occupy the room fitted up for me and ascend and descend the stairs with quickness and ease, requiring no \n\n\n                                   -219- \n\nassistance. I have every reason to praise the Lord that my right hand has not lost its cunning. I can trace the writings upon paper with ease; for this I am thankful. My mind in regard to the Scriptures is clear, and the comfort I receive from writing on Scriptural subjects is a source of continual gratitude. For one month I am awakened at twelve o'clock, and matters have been opened before me and deeply impressed upon my mind in regard to the cause and work of God to be carried forward at this important period of time when all the signs Christ has foretold should come are taking place as He predicted.",
