    "word": "The psalmist says, \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\" In these days of test and trial, we should take the Bible as our counselor and our guide, that we may make straight paths for our feet. The beautiful, glorious light of heaven is shining from the precepts of the law, clearly lighting up the pathway leading to the gates of the New Jerusalem. Those who walk in this light will never go astray.",
