    "word": "May 10, 1892. I have had a rather singular night. Sometime during the night I woke to find myself lying stretched out on my back. My heart was beating only feebly. I felt as if my body were being crushed under a mass of rubbish. I could hardly move any of my limbs. I did not know where I was. I called my nurse, but she did not hear me. After trying several times, I succeeded in moving my limbs, but my body seemed helpless. It was more than half an hour before I could understand that I was in bed, and before I could use my mind or move my limbs freely. Then the thought came to me that the angels of the Lord had awakened me, or else I should soon have breathed my last. How thankful I felt that I was guarded by heavenly angels. I dared not try to sleep again, for my heart seems to be very feeble in action.",
