    "word": "In the books of heaven are kept an accurate record of the manner of our education and what use we have made of our probationary golden moments. Every day we are learning lessons for time and eternity. Every thought cherished, every impulse indulged, leaves its impressions on the mind. We are under obligation to God to be constantly learning of Christ how to guide and control our thoughts, our feelings and passions. Oh, how fearfully lax we are in our duty to ourselves to let ourselves be molded by our own ideas and our own faulty will. We are running great risks in allowing ourselves to be thus controlled by circumstances.",
