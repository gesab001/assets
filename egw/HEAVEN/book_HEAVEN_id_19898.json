    "word": "Christ never causes confusion in minds. He says, \"I will surely bring punishment upon those who put themselves in My place, to control the minds of My blood-bought heritage; for thus they endanger the souls of those who have been purchased with the price of My own blood. These physicians are My workmen. They are to present to the world a standing evidence that the human mind, under the control of the Holy Spirit, represents the heavenly world. Better would it be for a man never to have been born than to spoil the souls of My heritage. The soul that is turned away from the word may lose eternal life. Unless the one who does this work comes to Me with repentance and confession, he will lose the life that measures with the life of God.\"",
