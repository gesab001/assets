    "word": "Thus when the servant of God is permitted to behold the glory of the God of heaven, as He is unveiled to humanity, and realizes to a slight degree the purity of the Holy One of Israel, he will make startling confessions of the pollution of his soul, rather than proud boasts of his holiness. In deep humiliation Isaiah exclaimed, \"Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips. . . .\" This is not that voluntary humility and servile self-reproach that so many seem to consider it a virtue to display.

There are many who demerit themselves in words, who would be disappointed if this course did not call forth expressions of praise and appreciation from others. But the conviction of the prophet was genuine.",
