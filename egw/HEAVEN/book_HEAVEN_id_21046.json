    "word": "Human philosophy declares that an indefinite period of time was taken in the creation of the world. Does God state the matter thus? No; he says, \"It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days [not six indefinite periods of time; for then there would be no possible way for man to observe the day specified in the fourth commandment] the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh he rested, and was refreshed.\" Please read carefully the fifth chapter of Deuteronomy. God says again, \"Remember [do not forget] the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. . . for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\"",
