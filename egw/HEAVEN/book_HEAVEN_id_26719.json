    "word": "A New Conversion Needed. \n\n                                Sanitarium, Cal., December, 1903. \n\nDr. J. H. Kellogg, \n     Sanitarium, \n     Battle Creek, Michigan. My dear Brother:-- \n     I praise the Lord for the letters that I have recently received from you. I greatly desire that you may now make a thorough work of repentance for time and for eternity. So long have you been retrograding toward union with the world, that it is difficult for you to see where you might now be standing, had you constantly advanced heavenward. You have lost many blessings because you have not felt your need of light.",
