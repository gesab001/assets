    "word": "The converted student has broken the chain which bound him to the service of sin, and has placed himself in the right relation to God. His name is enrolled in the Lamb's book of life. He is under solemn obligation to renounce evil, and come under the jurisdiction of God. Through earnest prayer he is to cleave to Christ. To neglect this, to refuse his service, is to forfeit the favor of the Great Teacher, and to become the sport of Satan's wiles. It was the design of heaven by the infinite sacrifice of Christ, to bring men and women into favor again with God. The education that brings the student into close relation with the Teacher sent from God, is true education.",
