    "word": "Those who think they can obtain a knowledge of God aside from His Representative, whom the Word declares is \"the express image of his person\" (Hebrews 1:3), will need to become fools in their own estimation before they can be wise. It is impossible to gain a perfect knowledge of God from nature alone; for nature itself is imperfect. In its imperfection it cannot represent God, it cannot reveal the character of God in its moral perfection. But Christ came as a personal Saviour to the world. He represented a personal God. As a personal Saviour, He ascended on high; and He will come again as He ascended to heaven--a personal Saviour. He is the express image of the Father's person. \"In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily\" (Colossians 2:9).",
