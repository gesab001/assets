    "word": "All who engage in ministry are God's helping hand. There is no line of work in which it is possible for the youth to receive greater benefit. They are coworkers with the angels; rather, they are human agencies through whom the angels accomplish their mission. Angels speak through their voices, and work by their hands. And the human workers, cooperating with heavenly agencies, have the benefit of their education and experience.--Youth's Instructor, March 3, 1908",
