    "word": "Men in sacred office ought not to be sanctioned and upheld while they are going down to the world's level, and dragging the banner \n                                                                           1402\nof truth after them. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I urge that the world's spirit and maxims, their likings, their principles, shall not leaven the churches. Shall the principles of heaven be discarded as in the days of Noah? Shall he that departeth from evil make himself a prey to sharp, critical, designing men? In the last work, the last influence, and the last warnings of the world, shall we give the trumpet an uncertain sound? There is a broad, clear, deep line drawn by the eternal God between worldly policy and the unselfish, undeviating principles of justice, and righteousness, and equity.",
