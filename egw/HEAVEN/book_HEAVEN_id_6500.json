    "word": "Communion with God imparts to the soul an intimate knowledge of His will. . . . True prayer engages the energies of the soul and affects the life. He who thus pours out his wants before God feels the emptiness of everything else under heaven. \"All my desire is before thee,\" said David, \"and my groaning is not hid from thee.\" \"My soul thirsteth for God. . . .\" \"When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me\" (Psalm 38:9; 42:2, 4).",
