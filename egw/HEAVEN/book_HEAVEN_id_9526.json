    "word": "Pain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. In the home of the redeemed there will be no tears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning. \u201cThe inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity\u201d (Isaiah 33:24). One rich tide of happiness will flow and deepen as eternity rolls on. Think of this; tell it to the children of suffering and sorrow, and bid them rejoice in hope.",
