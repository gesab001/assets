    "word": "I knew those who led the people into these noisy demonstrations, and as I arose to speak, they commenced \n\n\n                                     -130- \n\ndancing and jumping up and down, crying and shouting loudly, over and over again, \"The dead have been raised and have ascended to heaven.\" When they became too hoarse and too much exhausted to make so much noise, I bore my testimony, declaring that these fanatical movements, this din and noise, were inspired by the spirit of Satan, who was working miracles to deceive if possible the very elect. I said that it was not God's will that His pure, holy, sacred truth should be thus misinterpreted and brought into disrepute. The truth remained the truth still. These demonstrations did not change the unerring character of truth, but Satan was working to deceive and delude honest souls. Satan's agents were working vigilantly to make use of human minds in mingling the truth with tares and indecent practices, to bring a stigma upon the truth and make it of none effect.",
