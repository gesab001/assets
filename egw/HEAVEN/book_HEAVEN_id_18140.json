    "word": "His prayer is heard. While He is bowed in lowliness upon the stony ground, suddenly the heavens open, the golden gates of the City of God are thrown wide, and holy radiance descends upon the mount, enshrouding the Savior\u2019s form. Divinity from within flashes through humanity, and meets the glory coming from above. Arising from His prostrate position, Christ stands in godlike majesty. The soul agony is gone. His countenance now shines \u201cas the sun,\u201d and His garments are \u201cwhite as the light.\u201d\u2014The Desire of Ages, pp. 419-421.",
