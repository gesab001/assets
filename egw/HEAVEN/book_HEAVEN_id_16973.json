    "word": "Religion Not a Mere Cloak. God sees the heart, the deeds, and the purposes of the mind. It should be written on the conscience as with a pen of iron upon a rock that the man who expects true success in violating the eternal principles of right as written in the books of heaven, is not only foolish but wicked. Can men forget, \"Thou God seest me\"? Will you, my brother, turn away from idols? Your moral sense is clouded. Pray to God to bring all things to your remembrance that you may see things in their true bearing. Wear not the religion of Christ as a cloak, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ.",
