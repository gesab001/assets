    "word": "\"Now therefore saith the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. . . . Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and \n\n\n                                  -126- \n\nye run every man to his own house. Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit\" (Haggai 1:5, 6, 9, 10).",
