    "word": "\"There are some, even connected with our institutions, who are in great danger of making shipwreck of faith. Satan will work in disguise, in his most deceptive manner, in these branches of God's work. He makes these important instrumentalities his special points of attack, and he will leave no means untried to cripple their usefulness. . . .

We need light from heaven every hour, that we may distinguish between the sacred and the common, the eternal and the temporal.",
