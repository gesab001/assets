    "word": "The parables of Christ have been placed on record, and to the honest, diligent searcher after truth, their meaning will be made plain, their mystery unveiled. Those who will not seek for truth as for hidden treasure make manifest the fact that they do not sincerely desire to know what is truth. Christ still says to His true followers, \u201cIt is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.\u201d \u201cWhosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance.\u201d",
