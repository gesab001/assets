    "word": "If we love God and keep his commandments, we need not expect the world to be in sympathy with us, any more than it was with Christ. Says John, \u201cThe world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.\u201d And in all ages the defenders of the faith have realized the truth of the words of Paul, \u201cAll that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.\u201d Because the truth contradicts the doctrines of men, and condemns their unrighteous practices, it excites the most bitter opposition. The majority, even of those who bear Christ's name, are unwilling to follow his example of self-denial and cross-bearing; and as they become more and more alienated from him, they cannot distinguish between the heavenly \n196\nand the earthly; their peace is disturbed by the fact that there is a people that serve God and renounce every sinful practice. Men who are trampling upon God's requirements feel a constant rebuke from the course of those who render obedience to him; and this is why such enmity is manifested against all who are true to God. For this reason the Pharisees rejected Christ, and the same spirit still exists, and will continue to exist until the close of time.",
