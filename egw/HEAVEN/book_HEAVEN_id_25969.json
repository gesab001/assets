    "word": "\"The God of Heaven has been dishonored. You have found a place to invest means in various enterprises as though it were a virtue to leave my work in other lands to struggle in poverty and nakedness. You have not shared your abundant facilities as you might have done, even (though) the sacrifice required might appear large to you. Nothing that earth has given is of sufficient value to recompense the travail and burden of soul, the agonizing of mind that has been felt in seeing the people working at cross-purposes with God, hindering the work, and making it necessary for God to withdraw His prospering hand from the publishing association and from the conference.\"",
