    "word": "The temptations will surround us just as long as we live. Satan will try us in one way, and if he doesn't overcome us he will try us in another way.

The old cheap character, the frivolous character, the character which leads to the world, to pride, to vanity, and to folly, we have parted with that. We have left that, but not in our own strength. We have asked wisdom of God, and He says He giveth to all men--how? In such a stinted measure? No, liberally; and what? Upbraideth not.",
