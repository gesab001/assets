    "word": "Meeting the Consequences of Adam's Disloyalty.--But a change came [in Eden]. Satan tempted Adam, and he fell. He who in heaven had become disloyal, and had been cast out, made lying reports of God to the beings He had created, and they listened to his reports and believed his lie. And sin entered the world, and death by sin. The consequences of our first parents' disloyalty we now have to meet as we work for God, and until the close of this earth's history our labors will become more and more trying.-- Letter 29, 1903, pp. 2,3. (To the Members of the Churches in Australia and New Zealand, January 25,1903.)",
