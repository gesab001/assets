    "word": "True religion is a religion that keeps constantly in view the honor and glory of God. We are to regard our heavenly Father with holy fear and reverence. He requires of His blood-bought heritage a cheerful obedience. As we realize His great love, our hearts will be inspired with gratitude, we shall serve Him with cheerfulness, and firmly, confidently put our trust wholly in Him.",
