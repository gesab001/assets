    "word": "The ministry is a sacred office. Christ crucified is the power of God unto salvation to all who will believe. A Saviour lifted up--a Saviour full and complete to all who accept Him--is the science of salvation. The subject is never exhausted. It is always fresh; for today Christ is a living Intercessor before the Father in the heavenly courts. Christ, the propitiation for the sins of the world, is a living subject instinct with divinity, and always fresh and new.",
