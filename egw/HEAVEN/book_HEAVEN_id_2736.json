    "word": "There is a fullness of experience for every teacher to gain. The studies you take will either strengthen your faith and confidence in God, and teach you how to work as His helping hand, or they will leave you in a worse condition than you were before. Those who work out the principles that the Lord has given will stand on vantage ground. The mercies and blessings of heaven will come into their lives, enabling them to work out the will of God.",
