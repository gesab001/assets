    "word": "Few give thought to the suffering that sin has caused our Creator. All heaven suffered in Christ's agony; but that suffering did not begin or end with His manifestation in humanity. The cross is a revelation to our dull senses of the pain that, from its very inception, sin has brought to the heart of God. Every departure from the right, every deed of cruelty, every failure of humanity to reach His ideal, brings grief to Him. When there came upon Israel the calamities that were the sure result of separation from God--subjugation by their enemies, cruelty, and death--it is said that \"his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.\" \"In all their affliction he was afflicted: . . . and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old\" (Judges 10:16; Isaiah 63:9).",
