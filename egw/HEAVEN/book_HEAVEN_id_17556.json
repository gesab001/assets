    "word": "How precious are these words! \"Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory\" (verse 24). . . . Christ wills that we should behold His glory. Where? In the kingdom of heaven. He wills that we should be one with Him. What a thought! How willing it makes me to make any and every sacrifice for His sake! He is my love, my righteousness, my comfort, my crown of rejoicing, and He wills that we should behold His glory.",
