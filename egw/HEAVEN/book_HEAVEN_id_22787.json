    "word": "\"Make the Word of God the man of your counsel. It will be a lamp unto your feet, and a light unto your path. Study the Word to see what God has revealed in regard to who He is. He is 'the Almighty,' 'from everlasting,' an unerring Guide. Upon whom else would you venture to depend in times of difficulty? What folly could be greater than to set aside the wisdom of God, and accept the wisdom of him who fell from his exalted position in heaven as a covering cherub, and who has become the head of an apostate race? Will you unite with the arch-deceiver? Will you receive his deceptive falsehoods? Shall it continue to be said of you, 'Thou art weighed in the balances of the sanctuary, and art found wanting'?\"",
