    "word": "The Lord has clearly defined the road to the City of God; but the great apostate has changed the signpost, setting up a false one\u2014a spurious sabbath. He says: \u201cI will work at cross-purposes with God. I will empower my delegate, the man of sin, to take down God\u2019s memorial, the seventh-day Sabbath. Thus will I show the world that the day sanctified and blessed by God has been changed. That day shall not live in the minds of the people. I will obliterate the memory of it. I will place in its stead a day bearing not the credentials of heaven, a day that cannot be a sign between God and His people.",
