    "word": "Chap. 42 - Counsel Regarding Intermarriage\n[NOTE:\nTHESE MESSAGES WERE WRITTEN BY ELLEN G. WHITE IN 1896\nAND 1912. REPEATED STATEMENTS FROM HER PEN CONCERNING\nRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS CLEARLY INDICATE THAT HER COUNSEL\nON INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE IS NOT AN ISSUE OF RACIAL\nINEQUALITY; BUT ESSENTIALLY A QUESTION OF ADVISABILITY\nOR INADVISABILITY STEMMING FROM CIRCUMSTANCES AND\nCONDITIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN \"CONTROVERSY, CONFUSION\nAND BITTERNESS.\" SEE APPENDIX 2, \"IMPORTANT FACTORS IN\nCHOOSING A LIFE COMPANION.\" ELLEN G. WHITE HAS REPEATEDLY\nREAFFIRMED HER UNDERSTANDING OF, AND FIRM BELIEF IN, THE\nEQUALITY OF ALL RACES AND THE BROTHERHOOD OF MANKIND. SEE\nAPPENDIX 3, \"THE BROTHERHOOD OF MANKIND.\"--WHITE TRUSTEES.]\n-\n\n     We are one brotherhood. No matter what the gain or the loss, we must act nobly and courageously in the sight of God and our Saviour. Let us as Christians who accept the principle that all men, white and black, are free and equal, adhere to this principle, and not be cowards in the face of the world, and in the face of the heavenly intelligences. We should treat the colored man just as respectfully as we would treat the white man. And we can now, by precept and example, win others to this course.",
