    "word": "\"This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.\" \"For the Bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth light unto the world.\" \"I am the Bread of Life: he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst\" (verses 29, 33, 35). Christ gives them to understand that a man needs to be taught of God in order to comprehend these things. This is the cause of so much cheap knowledge of the Scriptures in the churches of today. Ministers preach only portions of the Word, and refuse to practice even as much as they teach. This leads to misconceptions of the Word and doctrine, it creates error and misinterpretations of the Scripture.",
