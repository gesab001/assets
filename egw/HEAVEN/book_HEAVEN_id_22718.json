    "word": "The Lord has in His heavenly counsels set forth methods and agencies whereby His grace shall be at work through various influences for the saving of the soul of the sinner. But all these facilities will be ineffectual and powerless without the sinner's consent to be drawn, and he cooperates with the divine agencies. It is a united work, a union of the divine and human, dependent upon grace, and concurring with grace in willing obedience.--Letter 135, 1898, undated, to Brother Starr. \n\nWhite Estate, Washington, D.
