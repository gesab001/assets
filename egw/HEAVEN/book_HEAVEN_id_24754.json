    "word": "Look at Martin Luther. As he stood before the people he cried \n\n\n                -29- \n\nout, \"The Bible, the Bible, is the foundation of our religion.\" And we want to search the Scriptures, praying the God of heaven to give us light upon it. And when these doctrines come pouring in upon us from every side, then we can say, \"The Bible, and the Bible alone, is the foundation of our religion.\" We want to believe that the Lord is coming in the clouds of heaven, and show our faith by our works, and be getting ready for His appearing.",
