    "word": "God is seeking to fit us for everlasting life. He longs that His people shall catch the strains of heavenly music, for He is our crown of rejoicing. He has put a new song on our lips, even thanksgiving unto our God. Penitence mingled with thanksgiving should be our experience every day. \"Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's\" [1 Corinthians 6:19, 20]. Study every plan, every method, used in your business, and think whether this business will most glorify God. To every man God has given his work.",
