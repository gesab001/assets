    "word": "Notice the next verse: \"Lie not one to another.\" If you have solemnly covenanted with God, in the presence of Christ and the Holy Spirit, to act as a member of the royal family, a child of the heavenly King, you will not in your life lie against the truth you profess to believe. You will not reveal by your works that you are a sinner, while professing to be a saint. If you are sincere in making this pledge, you will not be found nullifying your prayer. \"Thy \n\n\n                                  -105- \n\nkingdom come; Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven,\" by acting as sinners act whenever it best suits your convenience to act thus, and when you can advantage yourself and at your neighbor's disadvantage.",
