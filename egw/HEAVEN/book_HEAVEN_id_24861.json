    "word": "No one will be forced into the kingdom of heaven. Those who do not wish to enter show it by their actions. It is because we want to enter this kingdom that we have established a school here, and have called for the youth to come. We desire that they should be educated and trained aright, that they may learn what they should do in order to keep the intellect unimpaired. As we look at the world we know that iniquity abounds. Very little that is of God and heaven can be seen. We desire to bring all of heaven we possibly can into our homes, into the church, into the school, and we desire that the Lord shall see in us no perversity, no stubbornness, no disobedience.",
