    "word": "It is fitting that all who realize the near coming of the Lord, act their faith. When we see one of God's instrumentalities languishing or in peril, let those who are heart and soul in the work manifest their interest. If we would be one in mind and heart with the heavenly intelligences, we can be worked by them. When human agencies, as stewards of God, will unitedly take of the Lord's own substance, and use it to lift the burdens resting on his institutions, the Lord will co-operate with them.",
