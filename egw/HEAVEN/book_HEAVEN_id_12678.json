    "word": "The Father gave all honor to the Son, seating Him at His right hand, far above all principalities and power. He expressed His great joy and delight in receiving the Crucified One and crowning Him with glory and honor. And all the favors He has shown to His Son in His acceptance of the great atonement are shown to His people. . . . God loves them as He loves His son. . . . The seal of Heaven has been affixed to Christ's atonement. His sacrifice is in every way satisfactory.--The Signs of the Times, Aug. 16, 1899.",
