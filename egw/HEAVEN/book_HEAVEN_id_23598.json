    "word": "There are proud, Pharisaical men who think that it would be a great humiliation to confess that they had sinned. Thus Satan thought. Pride, self-sufficiency, a life of untruth--these things are barring their way to heaven. Could they see themselves as they are looked upon in the heavenly courts, their garments of self-righteousness would fall from them, leaving them ashamed, naked, condemned. For years they have had hardly a glimmer of light from the throne of God, and they have forgotten what it means to have a clear sense of justice and righteousness. They have given place to underhand working to take advantage of others, and they know not what it means to be filled with spiritual life. When the time of test comes, they will find that their refuge of lies will not shield them from the searching eyes of Him who sees every discrepancy, every falsehood.",
