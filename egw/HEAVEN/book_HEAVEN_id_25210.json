It was because, notwithstanding they had had Christ represented in the typical offerings and sacrifices, they could not get it out of their minds that it was the law, the law, the law that they must dwell upon as their entrance into heaven. And here Christ comes in with His lesson, not to detract from the law, but to reveal to them the old light in new settings. He comes to reveal that light in the framework of the gospel, that they might understand in regard to this light that it was essential for them to have.",
