    "word": "MR No. 1003 - Christ Our Assurance\n\n     It is court week with us. We have a case pending in the court of heaven, and when Jesus takes up your case you need not doubt. Your suit is presented to the Father and is indeed gained. Confession, humbling of the soul, is the only position of safety and of hope for any of us. There stands your Representative before the Father, to pour mercy and grace and truth into your soul. You are accepted in the Beloved, and should praise the Lord with heart and soul and voice.--Ms. 52, 1890, p. 3.",
