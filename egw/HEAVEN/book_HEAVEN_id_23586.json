    "word": "[Isaiah 48:9-13, 17, 18, quoted.] \n     The time will come when all must stand before angels and before men, revealed in their true light. As the artist reproduces upon the polished plate the features of the human countenance, so their characters are being transferred to the books of heaven. The great Master Artist faithfully delineates every phase of the character. Every manifestation of selfishness or greed is noted by Him. In the judgment every man will stand revealed just as he is, either fashioned after the divine similitude or disfigured by the idolatrous sins of selfishness and covetousness. - Ms 53, 1903. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 6, 1987. Entire Manuscript.",
