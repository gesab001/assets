    "word": "Your age is sufficient reason why you should be contented where you are.  Let the young men and women fill the hard places: it is your privilege to make your life as easy and comfortable as possible, while you prepare to move to a better country, even a heavenly.  If the Lord sees that it is best that you work in the cause, He will open ways for you in California.  Wait until the Lord makes your way clear.  He would not have you left dependent on strangers in a far country. Be contented to sustain yourselves where you are, doing what you can for the cause of God.  Help where you can with the word of your testimony, but do not feel that it is your duty to use up what little means you have in going to a new field.",
