    "word": "When Christ appointed to Peter his work, the apostle, turning to a brother disciple, asked, \u201cLord, what shall this man do?\u201d Jesus gently reproved him, saying, \u201cWhat is that to thee? Follow thou me.\u201d Here is our work,\u2014to look to Jesus, and pattern after his character; and we should be very jealous of ourselves, lest we shall fail to meet the divine standard. I remember when we were looking for the Saviour to come in 1844, how great was the anxiety of each to know that his own heart was right before God. When we met together, the question would be asked by one and another, \u201cBrethren, have you seen anything in me that is not right? I know that we are often blind to our own faults, and if you have seen anything wrong in me, I want you to tell me.\u201d Sometimes errors would be pointed out, and we would all bow before God and seek forgiveness. If any variance or alienation existed, we felt that we could not separate until all were in harmony. Sometimes brethren who had difficulty would be seen going away together to some secret place to plead with God, and they would return with their hearts knit together in love. The sweet spirit of peace was in our assemblies, and the glory of God was around us. The faces of the believers shone with the light of heaven.",
