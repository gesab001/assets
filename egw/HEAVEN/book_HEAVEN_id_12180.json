Fidelity Must Precede Blessings.--[1 Chronicles 28:9 quoted.] This charge is given to the men in positions of trust in the work of God today as verily as it was given to Solomon. The day of test and trial is upon them, as verily as it was then upon Solomon.  {3BC 1128.10}  \n     Fidelity is required before God can bestow the blessings that He has promised. Those who offer God acceptable service must obey all His commandments. Thus they become representatives of Christ (MS 163, 1902).  {3BC 1128.11} \n     11-13, 19. An Angel Guided David's Writing.--The Lord, through His angel, instructed David, and gave him a pattern \n                                                                           1129\nof the house which Solomon should build for Him. An angel was commissioned to stand by David while he was writing out, for the benefit of Solomon, the important directions in regard to the arrangements of the house. David's heart was in the work (1SP 387, 388).  {3BC 1128.12}  \n     Carpenter of Nazareth Was Heavenly Architect.--Christ was the foundation of the Jewish economy. He planned the arrangements of the first earthly tabernacle. He gave every specification in regard to the building of Solomon's temple. He who worked as a carpenter in the village of Nazareth was the heavenly Architect who marked out the plan of the house where His name should be honored. The things of heaven and earth are more directly under Christ's supervision than many realize (MS 34, 1899).",
