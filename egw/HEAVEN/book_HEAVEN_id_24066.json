    "word": "Jesus is to be looked to as the bright and morning Star. His sayings should be our textbook. The instruction given in our schools should be in distinct lines, and should differ materially from the instruction of every other school in our land. These are not new truths, not a new revelation. Those whose eyes have been opened by the heavenly anointing behold wondrous things out of God's Word. The doctrine of the grace of Christ is to be gradually developed, represented by the advancement from dawn unto noonday.",
