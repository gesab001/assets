    "word": "Pray earnestly. Read and study the prayer of Christ, as given in the seventeenth chapter of John, and then seek to live lives that will answer that prayer. Read also the messages given in the third chapter of Revelation. God sent His angel from heaven to give these messages. The message to the Laodicean church belongs to the church in Los Angeles, and to our churches generally. Will they arouse, and do the work that God has given them to do? \n                               (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
