    "word": "The apostle is writing of the city of our God. We are preparing for that city, and we desire to do all we can to help others, that they also may find an abundant entrance into the city. We ourselves desire to be right with God, and we feel an intense interest that none may work against themselves, that they may not be reckless or careless of their health, but that their bodies may be in such a condition of health that they can fully appreciate their God-given privilege to prepare for the heavenly courts above.",
