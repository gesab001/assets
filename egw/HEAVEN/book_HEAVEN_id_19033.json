    "word": "The Lord will be with us during this life, if we allow ourselves to be led by His Spirit and do not neglect to glorify His name. We should bring as much of heaven as possible into this life. The light of heaven shining into the heart will be imparted in words of pleasantness, in deeds of kindness, to those who are near us. Having acquainted ourselves with God, when He comes we will be able to say, \"Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us\" (Isaiah 25:9).--Manuscript 111, Oct. 19, 1901, a sermon preached in the St. Helena Sanitarium chapel.",
