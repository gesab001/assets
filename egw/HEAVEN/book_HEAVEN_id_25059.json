    "word": "\"I am sorry to be compelled to take the position that I am forced to take in behalf of God's people. In taking this position, I am placed under the necessity of bearing the heavy burden of showing the evil of the plans that I know are not born of heaven. This is the burden that many times in the past the Lord has laid upon me, in order that His work might be advanced along right lines. How much care and anxiety, how much mental anguish and wearing physical labor might be saved me in my old age. But still I am under the necessity of going into the field of battle, and of discharging in the presence of important assemblies the duty that the Lord has laid upon me,-- the duty of correcting the wrong course of men claiming to be Christians but who are doing a work that will have to be undone at a great loss both financially and in the shaking of the confidence of the people.",
