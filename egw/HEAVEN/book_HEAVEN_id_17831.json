    "word": "My dear brother, look ever to Jesus, and bring heaven into your life here below. The road to heaven is narrow and the gate strait, but all who will may pass through the gate and walk in the narrow path. If we reach heaven at last, our heaven must begin here below. The more of heaven that we bring into life here, the greater will be our happiness in the home above.",
