    "word": "Everyone is to be judged in the courts of heaven according to the deeds that are done in the body. And this work of oppressing souls, of making the work doubly hard for those who are willing to make any sacrifice to advance the cause of God, will make every poor showing in the books of heaven. Shall we not cease this work? We need sanctified tongues, and we need our lips touched by a live coal from the altar. Our voices should give forth melody. When you speak to those who are in discouragement, let them know that they have your sympathy. How much better to speak kind and tender and loving words than words that will bruise and wound the soul. Will you remember that these souls are the purchase of the blood of Christ? He says, \"As ye do these things unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye do them unto me. They are Christ's property, and we want to lift them up, that they may be in health, in courage, in faith, in hope.",
