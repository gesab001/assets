    "word": "We must give the Lord a chance to do his work, his great work for the soul. Christ is our sufficiency. Each one of us must understand that it means to have the Word of God fulfilled in us. As Christ was in this world, so we are to be. If in this life we are like him in character, we shall in heaven have his likeness. If there is no likeness between Christ and us in this world, there can be no fellowship between us when he shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him. As religious teachers we are under obligation to teach our students how to engage in medical missionary work. Those who do this work have many opportunities to sow the seed of truth in a way that will be successful. A heart full of gratitude to God can pray, \"Teach me thy way, O God, lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies, or rather because of mine observers.\"",
