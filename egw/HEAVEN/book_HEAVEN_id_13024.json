    "word": "Our heavenly Father is our Ruler, and we must submit to His discipline. We are members of His family. He has a right to our service. . . . We must not study to have our own way, but God's way and God's will. . . . Human beings suffer much because they step out of the path that God has chosen for them to follow. They walk in the sparks of the fire they themselves have kindled, and the sure result is affliction, unrest, and sorrow, which they might have avoided if they had submitted their will to God. . . . Whatever path God chooses for us, whatever way He ordains for our feet, that is the only path of safety. . . . With the eye of faith, with childlike submission as obedient children, we must look to God, to follow His guidance, and difficulties will clear away. The promise is, \"I will instruct thee and teach thee.\" \n                                                                           176",
