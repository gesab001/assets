    "word": "A Species of Idolatry \n\n     This making and exchanging photographs is a species of idolatry. Satan is doing all he can to eclipse heaven from our view. Let us not help him by making picture-idols. We need to reach a higher standard than these human faces suggest. The Lord says, \"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.\" Those who claim to believe in Christ need to realize that they are to reflect His image. \n                                                                           317\nIt is His likeness that is to be kept before the mind. The words that are spoken are to be freighted with heavenly inspiration. . . .",
