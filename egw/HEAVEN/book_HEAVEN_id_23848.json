    "word": "God desires us to understand that we are never to try to rule or to seek for the supremacy. Active humility and true goodness are to be constantly cherished. The spirit is to be softened and subdued. God will lead every one who will be led. My son, do not manifest a dictatorial spirit. Work with an eye single to the glory of God. Whatever may come into your experience, remember that the heavenly Father knows all things, and that He will set things in order, if we are not in too great a haste. He is our sanctification and righteousness.",
