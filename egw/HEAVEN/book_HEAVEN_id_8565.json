    "word": "Ruinous Influence of Self-exaltation on Mind.-- So deep is the impression of self-exaltation in the human heart, so great the desire for human power, that with many mind and heart and soul become absorbed with the idea of ruling and commanding.

Only the power of divine grace can make man understand his true position and accomplish for him the work essential to be wrought in the heart.--Lt 412, 1907.",
