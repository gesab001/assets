    "word": "Economy in the Home \n\n     The Lord has made men His agents, and with heart filled with the love of Jesus, they are to cooperate with Him in turning men from error to truth. God blesses the earth with sunshine and showers. He causes the earth to bring forth its plenteous treasures for the use of man. The Lord has made man His almoner to dispense His heavenly gifts by bringing souls to the truth.

Men and women brought their tithes and offerings unto God, and as means filled the treasury, men were sent out to advance the work.",
