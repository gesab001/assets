    "word": "My brethren and sisters, let us stand where Heaven can cooperate with us, where the grace of God and His Holy Spirit can rest upon us, and work through us. I was going away today, but I felt that before departing I must lay before you the great need of the converting power of God if the workers in this institution are to obtain the experience that was in His purpose in the establishing of this institution. All this seeking for the highest place, all this determination to carry our individual ideas and desires should stop right now. It does not please the Master. God wants us to be converted from our ways to His way.",
