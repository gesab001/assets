    "word": "\u201cGive us this day our daily bread.\u201d Matthew 6:11.\nThe first half of the prayer Jesus has taught us is in regard to the name and kingdom and will of God\u2014that His name may be honored, His kingdom established, His will performed. When you have thus made God\u2019s service your first interest, you may ask with confidence that your own needs may be supplied. If you have renounced self and given yourself to Christ you are a member of the family of God, and everything in the Father\u2019s house is for you. All the treasures of God are opened to you, both the world that now is and that which is to come. The ministry of angels, the gift of His Spirit, the labors of His servants\u2014all are for you. The world, with everything in it, is yours so far as it can do you good. Even the enmity of the wicked will prove a blessing by disciplining you for heaven. If \u201cye are Christ\u2019s,\u201d\u201call things are yours.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:23, 21.",
