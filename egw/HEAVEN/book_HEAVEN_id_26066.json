    "word": "There are many inventions which cost large sums of money which it is just as well should not come into our work. They are not what our students need. Let the education given be simple in its nature. In giving us His Son, the Father gave the most costly gift that heaven could bestow. This gift it is our (637) privilege to use in our ministration to the sick. Let Christ be your dependence. Commit every case to the great Healer; let Him guide in every operation. The prayer offered in sincerity and in faith will be heard. This will give confidence to the physicians and courage to the sufferer.",
