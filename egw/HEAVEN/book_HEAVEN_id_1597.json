    "word": "The growth of the soul in grace, in purity, in comeliness, is little by little \u2014 a progressive work; but it must go forward unceasingly. The fruit is ever approaching perfection; the Christian is constantly assimilating the ways and will of Christ. But with many who claim to be Christians there is a painful certainty that they are not progressing heavenward, but are swayed by the customs and practices of the world. Fashions the most unlovely and unhealthful, the most contradictory to the laws of nature, are readily accepted by them. By eagerly beholding these fashions, they become changed to the likeness of what they so much admire. Thus they hasten to adopt the world's standard, where pride and fashion complete in them the transformation which Satan \n95\ndelights to see accomplished, and they become unstable as water. The steadfast, silent working of true piety loses its vitality and consistency; \u201cfaith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\u201d [James 2:17.]",
