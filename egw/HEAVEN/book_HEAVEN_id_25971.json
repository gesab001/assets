    "word": "In the establishment and carrying forward of sanitarium work, and strictest economy is ever to be shown. Workers are to be employed who will be producers as well as consumers. In no case is money to be invested for display. Gospel medical missionary work is today to be carried forward in simplicity, even as it was carried forward by the Majesty of heaven, who, seeing the necessities of a lost, sinful world, laid aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might stand at the head of humanity. In His way of working, He has left us a perfect example. \"If any man will come after me,\" He declared, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" The true medical missionary will obey these words. He will not strain every nerve to make a display, thinking thus to win souls to \n\n\n                        -41- \n\nthe Saviour. The Son of God left His heavenly home to come to a world all seared and marred by the curse, that He might seek and save the Lost. Ought we not, His followers, to show the same self-denial and self-sacrifice that His life revealed? For us He endured the privations of poverty. Shall we refuse to deny ourselves for His sake?",
