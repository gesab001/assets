    "word": "(Psalm 144:5, 6; Nahum 1:5, 6.) Destruction by Water and Fire.--In the bowels of the earth God has in reserve the weapons that He will use to destroy the sinful race. Since the Flood, God has used, to destroy wicked cities, both the water and the fire that are concealed in the earth. In the final conflagration God will in His wrath send lightning from heaven that will unite with the fire in the earth. The mountains will burn like a furnace, and pour forth \n                                                                           947\nstreams of lava [Nahum 1:5, 6; Psalm 144:5, 6 quoted] (MS 21, 1902).  {7BC 946.10} \n     11.
