    "word": "My brethren, be workers together with Christ. Make every possible effort in season and out of season to spread the light of present truth. The Lord has taught us how safe is the cable that anchors us to the living Rock. Here is an opportunity to labor for those who have truth on some points, but who on other points are not safely anchored. Keep in touch with the people wherever you can. \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Matthew 5:16. \n\n(438)",
