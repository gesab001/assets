    "word": "Basel, Nov. 24, 1885. I thank my heavenly Father for a precious night's rest. I am still suffering with cold. Write to Elder [Daniel] Bourdeau at Geneva four large sheets of writing paper, in regard to his work and the best manner of taking hold of it. He has gathered up notices in papers as far back as when he was in California, and wishes these put into his circulars or notices to go before the public. It is just such things as these that hurt Brother Daniel's influence. The appearance is that he is extolling himself. He wishes to make it very prominent that he is an American sent to Europe as a missionary. This is every word truth, but such notices put before the people are not the best way to reach them, for all notices of this character will arouse national prejudice and close doors to him that might otherwise be opened. \n\n\n                                  -334-",
