    "word": "There was no excitement in Christ's manner of teaching. He made truth stand forth in the light of heaven. He inculcated the principles that are ever to be honored. God has wisdom to impart to His servants. The precious, precious treasures of wisdom that have been concealed in nature will be unlocked and brought forth. Here wonderful resources will be given to God's people for use in His work.",
