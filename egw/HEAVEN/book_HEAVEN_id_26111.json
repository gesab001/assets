    "word": "It has been presented to me that unless changes are wrought in the dispositions of many who are here, they will never enter the kingdom of heaven. With some, self is uppermost. Contention and emulation are being cherished, the Spirit of God cannot control, but the enemy comes in to suggest and advise. My brethren and sisters, you cannot afford to permit this condition to continue. You cannot afford to make self-service first. This will destroy our work. It must not be that we have taken all these large responsibilities upon us for naught. We must do our work intelligently, and to the very best of our ability, if we would bring glory to God. His Spirit must come in and abide.",
