    "word": "The Sphere of Leading Physicians [REVIEW AND HERALD, AUG. 13, 1914.] \n\n\n     Precious light has been given me concerning our sanitarium workers. These workers are to stand in moral dignity before God. Physicians make a mistake when they confine themselves exclusively to the routine of sanitarium work, because they consider their presence essential to the welfare of the institution. Every physician should see the necessity of exerting all the influence the Lord has given him in as wide a sphere as possible; he is required to let his light shine before men, that they may see his good works and glorify the Father who is in heaven.",
