    "word": "Thus saith the Lord: \"Will my people hear the message from my servant, when they will not keep my word? Disobedience, a failure to practice my teachings, is the reason that there are so many voices and so much variance among my people. While they follow the impulses of their stubborn, rebellious hearts, they have no inclination to do my will. They set up their own will and choose their own way, and their way is not my way, neither are their thoughts my thoughts. \"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts!\"",
