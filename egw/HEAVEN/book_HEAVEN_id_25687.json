    "word": "Do we individually realize our true position, that as God's hired servants we are not to bargain away our stewardship? We have an individual accountability before the heavenly universe to administer the trust committed us of God. Our own hearts are to be stirred, our hands are to have something to impart of the income that God entrusts to us. The humblest of us may be an agent for God, using our gifts for his name's glory. He who improves his talent is to the best of his ability may present to God his offering as a consecrated gift, that shall be as fragrant incense before him. It is the duty of every one to see that his talents are turned to advantage as a gift that he must return, having done his best to improve it.",
