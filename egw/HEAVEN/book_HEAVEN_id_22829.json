    "word": "Your only safety and happiness are in making Christ your constant Counsellor. You can be happy in Him if you had not another friend in the wide world. Your feelings of unrest and homesickness or loneliness may be for your good. Your heavenly Father means to teach you to find in Him the friendship and love and consolation that will satisfy your most earnest hopes and desires. I fear that you are striving to carry your own burden. It is too heavy for you. Jesus bids you cast it upon Him that He may carry it for you. There is an experience for you to gain in faith and trust in God. He is faithful who hath promised. You must exercise faith in the promises of God. \n\n\n                                      -358-",
