    "word": "Seated upon the mount, surrounded by His disciples and a large . . . gathering, Jesus \"opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\" These are not murmurers and complainers, but those who are content with their condition and surroundings in life. They do not cherish the feeling that they deserve a better position than that which Providence has assigned them, but manifest a spirit of gratitude for every favor bestowed upon them. Every proud thought and exalted feeling is banished. . . .",
