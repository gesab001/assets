    "word": "Faith and works will keep us evenly balanced and make us successful in the work of perfecting Christian character. Jesus says, \"Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter in the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 7:21). Speaking of temporal food, the apostle said, \"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat\" (2 Thessalonians 3:10). The same rule applies to our spiritual nourishment; if any would have the bread of eternal life, let him make efforts to obtain it.",
