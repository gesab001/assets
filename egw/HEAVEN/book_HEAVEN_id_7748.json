    "word": "Some flatter themselves that the Lord will give them another opportunity, that there will be a second probation. Fatal delusion! Just now, day by day, hour by hour, we are building for the last great day. We are trading on our Lord's money, and at His coming He will reckon with us, and we shall have to give an account of what we have done with His goods. As responsible beings we are working for time and for eternity, making our records in the books of heaven, and preparing our reward or punishment. Our reward will be proportionate to our work. \u201cMy reward is with Me,\u201d Christ declares, \u201cto give every man according as his work shall be.\u201d Revelation 22:12. He will expect results from every one.",
