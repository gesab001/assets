    "word": "One soul saved for Jesus Christ is of more value than the whole world. Then how God would be honored if He could see that the physical, mental, and moral powers of men and women were kept free from every unnatural appetite, every wrong practice, every species of intemperance, tobacco-using, liquor drinking, or gluttony. Let men and women obey the work of God and they will bring heaven very near to earth.",
