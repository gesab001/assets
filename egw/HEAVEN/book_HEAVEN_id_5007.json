    "word": "The disciples, awaking, behold the flood of glory that illuminates the mount. In fear and amazement they gaze upon the radiant form of their Master. . . . Beside Him are two heavenly beings, in close converse with Him. They are Moses, who upon Sinai had talked with God; and Elijah, to whom the high privilege was given . . . never to come under the power of death. . . . Upon the mount the future kingdom of glory was represented in miniature--Christ the King, Moses a representative of the risen saints, and Elijah of the translated ones.",
