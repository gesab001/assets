    "word": "\"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\" [Romans 7:12]. This law is to be obeyed. In him who loves God supremely and his neighbor as himself, holiness will be perfected. When man submits to the control of the Holy Spirit, he works out his own salvation with fear and trembling, in humiliation and self-distrust. He depends upon God's power, allowing Him to will and to do of His good pleasure. So God, the divine agent, and man, the human agent, work in cooperation. As man receives the Holy Spirit, he loves God with all the heart and soul and strength and mind. Putting on Christ, he sits in heavenly places with Christ and his brethren.",
