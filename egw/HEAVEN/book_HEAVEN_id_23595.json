    "word": "Those who are called and chosen to the ministry of the Word will be true, self-sacrificing workers together with Christ. \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,\" Christ said. \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\" This commission is given to every ordained minister. The minister who is merely a speaker, who does not labor as Christ labored, putting his whole soul intelligently into the work, needs the true conversion.",
