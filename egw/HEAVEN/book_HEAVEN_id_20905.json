    "word": "Let those who contemplate giving themselves to the work, place themselves in connection with those who have had a good experience in the ways of God, and a knowledge of His cause. Let all seek a clear understanding of the Scriptures of truth. See to it that the living Saviour is your Saviour, and that you are following in His footsteps. Cultivate piety and humility of mind. Combat intellectual laziness and spiritual lethargy. Be ready for every work that you can do for the Master. Instead of catching up every new and fanciful interpretation of the Bible, cling to the message. Let not every influence affect you; but seek to develop a character that is \n                                                                           26\nconsistent, meek, teachable, and yet firm and cheerful; and with all this, be sober and watch unto prayer. Walk in a perfect way. Let the high, sacred truth you profess be constantly elevating your character, ennobling and refining you, and fitting you for the heavenly courts. The learners in Christ's school must show that they are not unappreciative scholars. Let the sanctifying grace of God strengthen, soften, and subdue your entire nature. You must yourself be what you wish others to be. Christ prayed concerning His disciples, \"I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified.\" Bring into your life the piety, the Christian courtesy, the respect for one another that you wish to see reflected in those who embrace the truth through your instrumentality.\" [REVIEW AND HERALD, MAY 29, 1888.]",
