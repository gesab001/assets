    "word": "The messenger of heaven cannot hope to please those who are determined to resist the truth. Christ describes them as saying, \"We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.\" Whatever course the messenger may pursue, it will be objectionable to the opposers of truth; and they will make capital of every defect in the manners, customs, or character of its advocate, in order that they may prevent those from giving it their candid attention and would listen to the evidences. If there is anything through which the opposers can find occasion to falsify the character or misinterpret the action of him who presents the truth, they will take advantage of it to deter those who would accept and obey the truth from hearing or believing the message.",
