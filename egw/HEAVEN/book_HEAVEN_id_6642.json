    "word": "But Christ knew that His work must begin in consecrating the humble trade of the craftsmen who toil for their daily bread. He learned the trade of a carpenter that He might stamp honest labor as honorable and ennobling to all who work with an eye single to the glory of God. And angels were His attendants, for Christ was just as truly doing His Father's business when toiling at the carpenter's bench as when working miracles for the multitude. He held His commission and authority from the highest power, the Sovereign of heaven.",
