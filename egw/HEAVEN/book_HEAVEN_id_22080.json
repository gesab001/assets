    "word": "The gifts of the Spirit, the promises of pardon, of consolation, the proffers of assistance, the invitations of love--all the provisions peculiar to the gospel--are for you. However sinful you may have been, God will receive you if you will now repent. Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near. Open your cold, proud heart to the Saviour. Confess, confess your sins. \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" Confess your own sins, and leave others to confess theirs. Make everything right between your soul and God. Accept Christ's gracious invitation. . . . He is calling on you to repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Let your heart break; let your love go out to Him who gave His life that you might live. Let your will become submissive to the will of God. Then you will drink at a purer fountain, even the fountain of living water.--Letter 209, 1904. (To A. R. Henry, June 24, 1904.) Released October 31, 1973.",
