    "word": "We are not bidden to prove them by their fair speeches and exalted professions. They are to be judged by the word of God. \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them.\" \"Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.\" Isaiah 8:20; Proverbs 19:27. What message do these teachers bring? Does it lead you to reverence and fear God? Does it lead you to manifest your love for Him by loyalty to His commandments? If men do not feel the weight of the moral law; if they make light of God's precepts; if they break one of the least of His commandments, and teach men so, they shall be of no esteem in the sight of heaven. We may know that their claims are without foundation. They are doing the very work that originated with the prince of darkness, the enemy of God.",
