    "word": "When approaching God, pray briefly, in simplicity. Do not dishonor God by your oratorical prayers, or by preaching the Lord a sermon in your prayers; but come to God in your soul need, and just tell Him what you want, as a child comes to an earthly parent; and trust your heavenly Father as a child trusts its earthly parent.",
