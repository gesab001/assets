    "word": "In educating children and youth, teachers should never allow one passionate word or gesture to mar their works for in so doing they imbue the students with the same spirit that they themselves possess. The Lord would have our primary as well as our more advanced schools, of that character that angels of God can walk through the room, and behold in the order and principles of government, the order and government of heaven. This is thought by many to be impossible; but every school should begin with this, and should work most earnestly to preserve the spirit of Christ in temper, in communications, in instruction, the teachers placing themselves in the channel of light where the Lord can use them as his agents, to reflect his own likeness of character upon the students. They may know that as God-fearing instructors they have helpers every hour to impress upon the hearts of the children the valuable lessons given.",
