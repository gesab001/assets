    "word": "The Sabbath was to be a sign between God and his people forever. In this manner was it to be a sign--all who should observe the Sabbath, signified by such observance that they were worshipers of the living God, the creator of the heavens and the earth. The Sabbath was to be a sign between God and his people as long as he should have a people upon the earth to serve him.",
