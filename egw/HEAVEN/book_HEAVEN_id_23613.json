    "word": "For Christ's sake do not speak or think evil. May the Lord help us not only to read the Bible but to practice its teachings. The human agent who is faithful in his work, who unites gentleness with his power, justice with his love, causes rejoicing among the heavenly intelligences, and glorifies God. Let us strive earnestly to be good and to do good, and we shall receive the crown of life that fadeth not away.--Ms 116, 1898. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Oct. 1, 1987. Entire Ms.",
