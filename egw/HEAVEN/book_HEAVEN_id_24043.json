    "word": "The work of Christ's representatives will be similar to that of their Redeemer. They are to communicate that which is heavenly and divine. And they are not to look to self nor trust in their own efforts. Neither should they place too high an estimate upon their own work. When they see that others do not regard their efforts as they themselves estimate them, they should not feel that their labors might as well cease; for this is the work of the enemy. We live to God, not to men. God estimates our work at its full value. He measures nobility of character; and whether men appreciate us or not in our lifetime, our character lives after we are gone. After man has no more to do with anything under the sun, the example he has set, the golden words he has spoken, live through all time and through all eternity.",
