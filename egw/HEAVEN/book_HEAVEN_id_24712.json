    "word": "Shall those who refuse to be converted, who reject the right of entrance through the gates into the city, charge God with severity and harshness? The result of allowing one sinner to enter heaven would be a second rebellion, and God cannot permit another. All who enter the heavenly city must be sanctified through the grace of God. Their weaknesses must be brought into such relation to truth that truth shall be their strongest point of character. Only those who have kept the truth--kept it in practice--can enter through the gates into the city of God.",
