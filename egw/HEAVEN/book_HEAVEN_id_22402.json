Many who had no knowledge of the meeting, but were moved by an earnest desire to go to a certain brother's \n\n\n                                    -234- \n\nhouse, came, and the rooms were well filled. This occurred at three different points, giving me opportunity to bear my message to them. At one house in Orrington, the door was closed upon me as they saw me coming, but in the name of the Lord I opened it. They said Phebe Knapp was in vision. She was crying out in a most pitiful manner, warning against me. I knelt by her side and asked my heavenly Father to rebuke the spirit which was upon her. She immediately arose, her agony and burden ended. I then addressed those who were present in the name of the Lord. I reasoned with them, and rebuked their fanatical spirit, and showed them the inconsistency of their course. . . . [I said] \"Am I not the same as when I came to you with the power of God resting upon me a few months since? I hold the same views as when we parted in union, love, and Christian fellowship.

Satan has been trying to deceive you. When Christ the great life-giver shall come in the clouds of heaven, to raise the dead, there will be a terrible earthquake. The trump of God will be heard resounding through earth's remotest bounds, and the voice of Jesus will call forth the dead from their graves to immortal life.",
