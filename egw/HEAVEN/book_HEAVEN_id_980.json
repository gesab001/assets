    "word": "The baptism of the Holy Ghost as on the day of Pentecost will lead to a revival of true religion, and to the performance of many wonderful works. Heavenly intelligences will come among us, and men and women will speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Spirit of God. But should the Lord work upon people as He did on and after the day of Pentecost, many who now claim to believe the truth would know so very little of the operation of the Holy Spirit that they would cry, \u201cBeware of fanaticism.\u201d They would say of those who were filled with the Spirit, \u201cThey are filled with new wine\u201d [Acts 2:13, NRSV]. . . .",
