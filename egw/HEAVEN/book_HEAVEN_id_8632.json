    "word": "You may have to punish your child with the rod. This is sometimes essential. But never, never strike him in anger. To correct him thus is to make two wrongs in trying to cure one. Defer the punishment till you have talked with yourself and with God. Ask yourself, Have I submitted my will to God's will? Am I standing where He can control me? Ask God to forgive you for transmitting to your child a disposition so difficult to manage. Ask Him to give you wisdom that you may deal with your wayward child in a way that will draw him nearer to you and to his heavenly Father.--RH, July 8, 1902.",
