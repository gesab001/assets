    "word": "A Christlike Work \n\n     In caring for the children we should not work from the standpoint of duty merely, but from love, because Christ died for their salvation. Christ has purchased these souls who need our care, and He expects us to love them as He has loved us in our sins and waywardness. Love is the agency through which God works to draw the heart to Him, for \"God is love.\" In every enterprise of mercy this principle alone can give efficiency; the finite must unite with the Infinite.",
