{"word": "By permitting John to be banished to the Isle of Patmos, Christ placed His disciple in a position where he could receive the most precious truth for the enlightenment of the churches. He placed him in solitude, that his ear and his heart might be sanctified to receive this truth. . . . The persecution of John's enemies became a means of grace. Patmos was made resplendent by the glory of a risen Saviour. . . . What a Sabbath that was to the lonely exile! . . . Never had he learned so much of Jesus. Never had he heard such exalted truth.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 315}
