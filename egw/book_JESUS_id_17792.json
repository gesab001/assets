{"word": "The seraphim dwelt in the presence of Jesus, yet they vailed with their wings their faces and their feet. They looked upon the King in His beauty, and covered themselves. When Isaiah saw the glory of God, his soul was prostrated in the dust. Because of the unclouded vision he was graciously permitted to behold, he was filled with self-abasement. This will ever be the effect upon the human mind when the beams of the Sun of Righteousness shine gloriously upon the soul. . . . As the increasing glory of Christ is revealed, the human agent will see no glory in himself; for the concealed deformity of his soul is laid bare, and self-esteem and\n137\nself-glorying are extinguished. Self dies, and Christ lives.\\97BE&ST Dec. 3, 1894.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TA", "page": 136}
