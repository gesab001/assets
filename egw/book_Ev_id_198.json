{"word": "Doctrine Must Bear Scrutiny of Great Men.-- \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life.\" Every position of truth taken by our people will bear the criticism of the greatest minds; the highest of the world's great men will be brought in contact with truth, and therefore every position we take should be critically examined and tested by the Scriptures.

Movements are at work to bring us to the front, and if our theories of truth can be picked to pieces by historians or the world's greatest men, it will be done.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 69}
