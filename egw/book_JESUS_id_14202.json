{"word": "In this way Christ's great work on earth was begun. One by one He called His disciples, and one brought his brother, another his friend. This is what every follower of Christ is to do. As soon as he himself knows Jesus, he is to tell others what a precious Friend he has found. This is a work that all can do, whether they are young or old.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SJ", "page": 51}
