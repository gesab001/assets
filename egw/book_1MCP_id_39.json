{"word": "Man to Become a New Creature.--Men are to become the subjects of Christ's kingdom. Through the divine power imputed to them they are to return to their allegiance. By laws and resources God has ordained a heavenly communication with man's spiritual life that in its action is as mysterious as the science and operation of the wind (John 3:7, 8). Christ declared, \"My kingdom is not of this world\" (John 18:36). While it imprints its influence upon earthly governments, it cannot take the slightest imprint from them without marring the divine similitude.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 14}
