{"word": "After the disciples of John had departed, Jesus addressed the multitude concerning John, \"What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?\" Jesus knew that a reed trembling in the wind was the very opposite of John's character. John could not be moved by flattery, nor be deceived by prevailing errors. Neither could he be turned aside from the work he came to do by rewards, or worldly honors. He would preserve his integrity at the expense of his life. Steadfast as a rock stood the prophet of God, faithful to rebuke sin and crime in all their forms, in kings and nobles, as readily as in the unhonored and unknown. He swerved not from duty. Loyal to his God, in noble dignity of moral character, he stood firm as a rock, faithful to principle.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 72}
