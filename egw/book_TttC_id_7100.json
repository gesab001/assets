    "word": "I felt led out to rebuke this man in the name of the Lord and to call upon the women who were with him to separate from him and withdraw their misplaced confidence, for unhappiness and ruin were in the path they had entered upon. \n                                                                           139\nThe Ledger of Heaven testifies of this man thus: \"A deceiver, an adulterer, creeping into houses and leading captive silly women.\" How many souls he will destroy with his satanic sophistry the judgment alone will reveal. Such men ought to be rebuked and discountenanced at once, that they may not bring a continual reproach upon the cause.",
