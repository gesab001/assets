{"word": "Do not encourage a class who center their religion in dress. Let each one study the plain teachings of the Scriptures as to simplicity and plainness of dress and by faithful obedience to those teachings strive to set a worthy example to the world and to those new in the faith. God does not want any one person to be conscience for another. Talk of the love and humility of Jesus; but do not encourage the brethren and sisters to engage in picking flaws in the dress or appearance of one another. Some take delight in this work; and when \n123\ntheir minds are turned in this direction, they begin to feel that they must become church tinkers. They climb upon the judgment seat, and as soon as they see one of their brethren or sisters, they look to find something to criticise. This is one of the most effectual means of becoming narrow-minded, and of dwarfing spiritual growth. God would have them step down from the judgment seat, for he has never placed them there. I speak thus plainly because I know your danger in this country. Already souls have become discouraged and given up the truth because of this spirit manifested toward them.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 122}
