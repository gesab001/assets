{"word": "We are never to forget that Christ teaches through His servants. There may be conversions without the instrumentality of a sermon. Where persons are so situated that they are deprived of every means of grace, they are wrought upon by the Spirit of God and convinced of the truth through reading the word; but God's appointed means of saving souls is through \"the foolishness of preaching.\" Though human, and compassed with the frailties of humanity, men are God's messengers; and the dear Saviour is grieved when so little is effected by their labors. Every minister who goes out into the great harvest field should magnify his office. He should not only seek to bring men to the knowledge of the truth, but he should labor, as did Paul, \"warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom,\" that he may \"present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.\" \n                                                                           301", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 300}
