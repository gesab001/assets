    "word": "PAGE 292--THE MAGICIANS DID NOT REALLY CAUSE THEIR RODS TO BECOME SERPENTS; BUT BY MAGIC, AIDED BY THE GREAT DECEIVER, THEY WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE THIS APPEARANCE. IT WAS BEYOND THE POWER OF SATAN TO CHANGE THE RODS TO LIVING SERPENTS. THE PRINCE OF EVIL, THOUGH POSSESSING ALL THE WISDOM AND MIGHT OF AN ANGEL FALLEN, HAS NOT POWER TO CREATE OR TO GIVE LIFE; THIS IS THE PREROGATIVE OF GOD ALONE. BUT ALL THAT WAS IN SATAN'S POWER TO DO HE DID; HE PRODUCED A COUNTERFEIT. TO HUMAN SIGHT THE RODS WERE CHANGED TO SERPENTS. SUCH THEY WERE BELIEVED TO BE BY PHARAOH AND HIS COURT. THERE WAS NOTHING IN THEIR APPEARANCE TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE SERPENT PRODUCED BY MOSES AND AARON. THUS THE TESTIMONY SPEAKS OF IT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SCRIPTURES; WHILE THE SAME SPIRIT EXPLAINS THAT THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK OF IT AS THE CASE APPEARED. SEE TESTIMONY NO. 33, VOL. 5, PP. 696-698.",
