{"word": "Chap. 36 - Sister White and Prayer for the Sick\n-\n\n     The question has been asked by some, \"Has Sister White healed the sick?\" I answer, \"No, no; Sister White has often been called to pray for the sick, and to anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord Jesus, and with them she has claimed the fulfillment of the promise, 'The prayer of faith shall save the sick.'\" No human power can save the sick, but, through the prayer of faith, the Mighty Healer has fulfilled His promise to those who have called upon His name. No human power can pardon sin or save the sinner. None can do this but Christ, the merciful physician of body and soul.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 295}
