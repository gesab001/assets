    "word": "Bringing so many believers together in one place tends to encourage evil surmising and evilspeaking. Many become absorbed in looking and listening for evil. They forget what a great sin they are committing. They forget that the words they speak can never be unsaid and that by their suspicions they are sowing seeds that will spring up to bear a harvest of evil. How great this harvest is no one will know until the last great day, when every thought, word, and action will be brought into judgment.",
