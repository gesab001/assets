    "word": "You must exemplify the life of Christ, for solemn responsibilities rest upon you. Your wife is responsible to God for her course. If she is a hindrance to you she must render an account to God. Sometimes she arouses and humbles herself before God and is a real help; but she soon falls back into the same inactive state, shunning responsibilities, and excusing herself \n                                                                           628\nfrom mental and physical labor. Her health would be far better if she were more active, if she would engage more cheerfully and heartily in physical and mental labor. She does not lack the ability, but the disposition to act; she will not persevere in cultivating a love for activity. God can do nothing for her in her present condition. She has something to do to arouse herself and devote to God her physical and mental energies. God requires this of her, and in the day of God she will be found an unprofitable servant unless there is a thorough reformation on her part and she lives up to the light given. Until this reformation takes place, she should not be at all united with her husband in his labors.",
