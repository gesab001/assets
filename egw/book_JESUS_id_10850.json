{"word": "Jesus says, \"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 5:3). There is fullness of grace in God, and we may have His spirit and power in large measure. Do not feed on the husks of self-righteousness, but go to the Lord. He has the best robe to put upon you, and His arms are open to receive. Christ will say, \"Take away the filthy garments from him, and clothe him with a change of raiment.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 328}
