    "word": "Never are we to rely upon worldly recognition and rank. Never are we, in the establishment of institutions, to try to compete with worldly institutions in size or splendor.

Better far the cross and disappointed hopes, \n                                                                           101\nwith eternal life at last, than to live with princes and forfeit heaven.",
