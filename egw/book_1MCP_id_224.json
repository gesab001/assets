{"word": "Satan Strikes at the Perceptive Faculties. [SEE CHAPTER 35, \"THE INFLUENCE OF PERCEPTION.\"]--Satan comes to man with his temptations as an angel of light, as he came to Christ. He has been working to bring man into a condition of physical and moral weakness that he may overcome him with his temptations and then triumph over his ruin. And he has been successful in tempting man to indulge appetite, regardless of the result. He well knows that it is impossible for man to discharge his obligations to God and to his fellowmen while he impairs the faculties God has given him. The brain is the capital of the body. If the perceptive faculties become benumbed through intemperance of any kind, eternal things are not discerned.--RH, Sept 8, 1874. (MYP 236.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 73}
