    "word": "Parents should seek to interest their children in the study of physiology. There are but few among the youth who have any definite knowledge of the mysteries of life.

Needless trifles occupy their attention, and then they plead a lack of time as an excuse for not obtaining the information necessary to enable them properly to instruct their children.",
