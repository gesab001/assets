He says: \"We are laborers together with God.\" 1 Corinthians 3:9. \"Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.\" Colossians 3:23. And Peter exhorts the believers: \"As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ.\" 1 Peter 4:10, 11. \n                                                                -", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "9T", "page": 221}
