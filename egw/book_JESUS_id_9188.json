{"word": "We need divine help if we would keep our lights burning. But Jesus died to provide that aid. He extends the invitation: \\93Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.\\94 Cling to the arm of Infinite Power; then you will find Him \n297\nprecious to your soul, and all heaven will be at your command. \\93If we walk in the light, as he is in the light,\\94 we shall have the companionship of holy angels. To \\93Joshua\\94 it was said, \\93Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge,...I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.\\94 And who are \\93these that stand by\\94? They are the angels of God. Joshua must have a living, confiding trust in God every day; and then angels would walk with him, and the power of God would rest upon him in all his labors.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 296}
