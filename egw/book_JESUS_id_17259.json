{"word": "Here is seen love stronger than death, that binds the mother's heart to her child. And yet God says that the mother will sooner forget her child than that He will forget a soul that trusts in Him. That the Lord loves us is enough to call forth deepest gratitude, every hour of our lives. God's love is speaking to you. Give attention or you will not apply His words to yourself. Only trust the love of Jesus, and you will realize the deepest joy.--Letter 12, Aug. 9, 1873, to Edson and Emma White.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 230}
