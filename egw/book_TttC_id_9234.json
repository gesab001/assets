    "word": "A Personal Appeal \n\n     I appeal to the teachers in our educational institutions not to let religious earnestness and zeal retrograde. Make no backward movements, but let your watchword be: \"Advance.\" Our schools must rise to a much higher plane of action; broader views must be held; stronger faith and deeper piety must exist; the word of God must be made the root and branch of all wisdom and intellectual attainments. When the converting power of God takes hold of them, they will see that a knowledge of God covers a much broader field than the so-called \"advance methods\" of education. In all the education given, they should remember \n                                                                           158\nthe words of Christ: \"Ye are the light of the world.\" Matthew 5:14. Then they will not experience so great hindrance in preparing missionaries to go out and give their knowledge to others.",
