{"word": "Chap. 65 - Indolence\n\n\n     Obligation to Develop Intellect to Its Maximum.-- God requires the training of the mental faculties. He designs that His servants shall possess more intelligence and clearer discernment than the worldling, and He is displeased with those who are too careless or too indolent to become efficient, well-informed workers. The Lord bids us love Him with all the heart and with all the soul and with all the strength and with all the mind. This lays upon us the obligation of developing the intellect to its fullest capacity, that with all the mind we may know and love our Creator.--COL 333 (1900).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 602}
