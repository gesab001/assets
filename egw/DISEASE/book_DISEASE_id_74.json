    "word": "How beautiful the earth was when it came from the Creator\u2019s hand! God presented before the universe a world in which even His all-seeing eye could find no spot or stain, no defect or crookedness. Each part of His creation occupied the place assigned it and answered the purpose for which it was created. Like the parts of some great machine, part fitted to part, and all was in perfect harmony. . . . There was no disease . . . and the vegetable kingdom was without taint of corruption. God looked upon the work of His hands wrought out by Christ and pronounced it \u201cvery good.\u201d He looked upon a perfect world, in which there was no trace of sin, no imperfection.",
