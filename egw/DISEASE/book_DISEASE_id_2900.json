    "word": "I tell you, dear brother, there are grave mistakes made in dealing with unbalanced, diseased minds. They are sick. They need a physician, not to cut them off as a diseased limb, but to heal them. Jesus' course of management is given in the parable of the lost sheep. Should Jesus deal with us as we deal with one another, not one of us could be saved. Oh, how many will be lost because the words that should have been spoken in tender forbearance were left unsaid.",
