    "word": "The juices and fluids of what we eat pass into the circulation of the blood, and, as we are composed of what we eat, by feeding on flesh we become animalized; thus a feverish condition is created, because the animals are diseased, and by partaking of their flesh we plant the seeds of disease in our own tissue and blood. Then when exposed to the changes in a malarious or poisonous atmosphere, these are more sensibly felt; also when we are exposed to prevailing epidemics and contagious diseases the system is not in condition to resist disease.",
