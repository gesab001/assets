    "word": "A Physician's Opportunities \n\n     Every physician should be a Christian. In Christ's stead he is to stand by the suffering, working as Christ worked, ministering to the needs of the sin-sick soul as well as to the needs of the diseased body. The physician should look to his Saviour saying, \"I sanctify myself through the grace freely given me, that those to whom I minister may also be sanctified.\"",
