    "word": "MS.--3--'97 \n     Physicians who claim to understand the human organism ought not to encourage their patients to subsist on the flesh of dead animals. They should point out the increase of disease in the animal kingdom. The testimony of examiners is that very few animals are free from disease, and that the practice of eating largely of meat is contracting diseases of all kinds,-- cancers, tumors, scrofula, tuberculosis, and numbers of other like afflictions. If man will subsist on the food that God has so abundantly provided without having it first pass into the animal organism and become sinew and muscle, and then take it second-hand by eating of the corpse, his health would be much better insured.",
