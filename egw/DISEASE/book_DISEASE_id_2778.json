    "word": "The Lord's plan is to have small sanitariums established in many places, so that the greatest number of people, East and West, North and South, can be reached through this means.

Let us preserve these institutions in their original simplicity, ever bearing in mind that other places are just as much in need of similar facilities for the treatment of disease. We must not allow ambition to lead us to rob a neighboring field or a sister institution in order to upbuild our own.",
