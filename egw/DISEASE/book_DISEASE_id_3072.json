    "word": "I would say to our physicians, Never allow your patients to think that in the human being is power to heal the sick. You are to depend much more than you have done on the co-operation of the Great Physician in the work of healing disease. Your faith is to lay hold upon the efficacy of Christ to make effectual the effort put forth for the recovery of the sick.",
