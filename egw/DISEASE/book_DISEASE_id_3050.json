H. Evans, E. E. Andross and H. W. \n     Cottrell, reading as follows: \n\n\n     \"Are we to understand, from what you have written concerning \n     the establishment of a medical school at Loma Linda, \n     that, according to the light you have received from the \n     Lord, we are to establish a thoroughly equipped medical \n     school, the graduates from which will be able to take \n     State Board examinations and become registered, qualified \n     physicians.\" \n\n\n     The light given me is, we must provide that which is essential to qualify our youth who desire to be physicians, so that they may intelligently fit themselves to be able to stand the examinations essential to prove their efficiency as physicians. They are to be prepared to stand the essential tests required \n\n\n                              -487- \n\nby law, and to treat understandingly the cases of those who are diseased, so that the door will be closed for any sensible physician to fear that we are not giving in our school the instruction essential for the proper qualification of a physician. Continually the students who are graduated are to advance in knowledge; for practice makes perfect.",
