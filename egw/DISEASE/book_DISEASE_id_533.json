    "word": "The Causes of Disease to Be Understood \n\n     The most exalted part of the physician's work is to lead the men and women under his care to see that the cause of disease is the violation of the laws of health and to encourage them to higher and holier views of life. Instruction should be given that will provide an antidote for the diseases of the soul as well as for the sickness of the body. Only that sanitarium will be a healthful institution where right principles are established. The physician who, knowing the remedy for the diseases of the soul and body, neglects the educational part of his work, will have to give an account of his neglect in the day of judgment. Strict purity of language and every word and action is to be guarded. \n\n\n                                               (367)",
