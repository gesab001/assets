    "word": "My son, you need the peace of Christ. God is your Father. He would have you take more time to rest, that you may have a healthy spiritual experience. He loves you with a deep and tender love. O children, there are great things before us. Edson, do not allow your mind to become in any way diseased. God wants your mind to be clear, your temper sweet, and your love abounding. Then the peace that passeth knowledge will flow forth from you to bless all with whom you come into contact. The atmosphere surrounding your soul will be refreshing. Your words will be fragrant.",
