    "word": "H. R. (H. L., para. 624) \n     It ever has appeared to me to be cold, heartless business for mothers who can nurse their children to turn them from the maternal breast to the bottle. But in case that it is necessary, the greatest care must be exercised to have the milk from a healthy cow, and to have the bottle, as well as the milk perfectly sweet. This is frequently neglected, and as the result, the infant is made to suffer needlessly. Disturbances of the stomach and bowels are liable to occur, and the much-to-be-pitied infant becomes diseased, if it were healthy when born.",
