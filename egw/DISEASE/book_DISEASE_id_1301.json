    "word": "Overtaxed Mind Impairs Health.--Brethren have invested means in patent rights and other enterprises and have induced others to interest themselves, who could not bear the perplexity and care of such business. Their anxious, overtaxed minds seriously affect their already diseased bodies, and they then yield to despondency, which increases to despair. They lose all confidence in themselves and think that God has forsaken them, and they dare not believe that He will be merciful to them.--1T 304, 305 (1862).",
