    "word": "In every place where we have a church, there should be some place specially fitted up where treatments can be given--a bathhouse with appropriate rooms. This is as the Lord designs it should be. There are few families so situated that they can accommodate in their dwelling-houses the one needing treatment, and thus help to prevent disease. In every place a building, even though rude and inelegant, should be erected. It should be plainly and comfortably furnished with springbeds, easy chairs, et cetera. Treatment ought not to be given in sleeping rooms.",
