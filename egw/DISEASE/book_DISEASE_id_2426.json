    "word": "We see ladies professing godliness wear elegant gold chains, necklaces, rings, and other jewelry . . . while want stalks in the streets, and the suffering and destitute are on every side. These do not interest them, nor awaken their sympathy; but they will weep over the imaginary suffering depicted in the last novel. They have no ears for the cries of the needy, no eyes to behold the cold and almost naked forms of women and children around them. They look upon real want as a species of crime, and withdraw from suffering humanity as from a contagious disease. To such, Christ will say, \u201cI was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: . . . sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.\u201d",
