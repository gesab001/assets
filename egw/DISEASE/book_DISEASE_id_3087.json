    "word": "Extract from letter B.82, dated Feb. 20, '08. \n\n\n     This blending of our schools and sanitariums will prove an advantage in many ways. Through the instruction given by the sanitarium, students will learn how to avoid forming careless, intemperate habits of eating. Let the instruction be given in simple words. We have no need to use the many expressions used by worldly physicians, which are so difficult to understand that they must be interpreted by the physician. These long names are often used to conceal the character of the drugs being used to combat disease. We do not need these. \n                                                                           37",
