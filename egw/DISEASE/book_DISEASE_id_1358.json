    "word": "Right Exercise of Will Resists Disease.--I have been shown that many who are apparently feeble and are ever complaining are not so badly off as they imagine themselves to be. Some of these have a powerful will, which, exercised in the right direction, would be a potent means of controlling the imagination and thus resisting disease. But it is too frequently the case that the will is exercised in a wrong direction and stubbornly refuses to yield to \n\n690 \n\nreason. That will has settled the matter; invalids they are, and the attention due to invalids they will have, irrespective of the judgment of others.--2T 524 (1870).",
