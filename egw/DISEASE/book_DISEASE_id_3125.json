    "word": "Persons with tumors ruining their life away should not be burdened with the question as to whether they should leave meat eating or not. Be careful to make no stringent resolutions in regard to this matter. It will not help the case to force changes, but will do injury to the non-meat-eating principles. Give lectures in the parlor. Educate the mind, but force no one: for such reformation made under pressure is worthless, and they will surely go back to a meat-eating diet. Enlighten the mind, that God would be pleased to have the body free from disease. The greatest cause of disease is in the food taken into the system in large meat-eating. When you remove the meat from the table, you have a work to do to substitute articles of food tasteful and appetizing in fruits and grains. Meat will soon be forgotten in arousing the conscience and the determined will brought into action. There is to be no forcing the mind, but educating it to view the subject from a right standpoint.",
