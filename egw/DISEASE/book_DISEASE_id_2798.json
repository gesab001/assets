    "word": "MR No. 605 - Work for Various Classes\n\n     In the work for the lower class, the strongest precautions should be observed. There are many who should not go into the large cities to work for the most depraved. There is a work to be done not after the order of the work which has been done. Medical missionary work will become diseased if left to run to such lengths as it has been carried on in some places.",
