    "word": "Poor Ventilation. \n     714. Many families suffer from sore throat, lung diseases, and liver complaints, brought upon them by their own course of action. . . . They keep their windows and doors closed, fearing they will take cold if there is a crevice to let in the air. They breathe the same air over and over, until it becomes impregnated with the poisonous impurities and waste matter thrown off from their bodies, through the lungs and the pores of the skin.--H. to L., Chap. 4, p. 63.",
