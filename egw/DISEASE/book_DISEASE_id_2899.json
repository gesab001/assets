    "word": "If you had laid their wrong course of action before them, they would have braced themselves in stubbornness and defiance; but to be treated in tenderness and consideration they feel more deeply their own course of action and contrast it with yours. Then you have the staff in your own hands; you occupy vantage ground, and when you show a solicitation for their souls, they know that you are no hypocrite, but that you mean every word you say. I have been shown that a few words spoken in a hasty manner, under provocation, and which seemed but a little thing--just what they deserved--cut the cords of influence that should have bound the soul to your soul. The very idea of their being in darkness, under the temptation of Satan and blinded by his bewitching power, should make you feel deep sympathy for them, the same that you would feel for a diseased, sick patient who suffers, but, on account of his disease, is not aware of his danger.",
