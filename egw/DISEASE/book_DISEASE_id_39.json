    "word": "Do Not Wait \n\n     Workers-gospel medical missionaries-are needed now. You cannot afford to spend years in preparation. Soon doors now open \n                                                                           30\nto the truth will be forever closed. Carry the message now. Do not wait, allowing the enemy to take possession of the fields now open before you. Let little companies go forth to do the work to which Christ appointed His disciples. Let them labor as evangelists, scattering our publications, and talking of the truth to those they meet. Let them pray for the sick, ministering to their necessities, not with drugs, but with nature's remedies, and teaching them how to regain health and avoid disease.--Testimonies, Vol. 9, pp. 171, 172. \n\n                                               -",
