    "word": "Many have expected that God would keep them from sickness merely because they have asked Him to do so. But God did not regard their prayers, because their faith was not made perfect by works. God will not work a miracle to keep those from sickness who have no care for themselves, but are continually violating the laws of health, and make no effort to prevent disease. . . . God will not work in a miraculous manner to pre-serve the health of persons who are taking a sure course to make themselves sick, by their careless inattention to the laws of health.\u2014Review and Herald, Apr. 2, 1914.",
