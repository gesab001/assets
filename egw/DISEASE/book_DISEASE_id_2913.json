    "word": "The grace of God is always reformatory. Every human being is in a \n\n                                     -7- \n\nschool where he is to learn to give up hurtful practices, and obtain a knowledge of what he can do for himself. Those who ignore these things, who take no precautions in regard to getting pure air to breathe and pure water to drink, cannot be free from disease. Their systems are defiled, and the human structure injured.",
