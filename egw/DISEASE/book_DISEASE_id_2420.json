    "word": "The lungs should not be deprived of pure, fresh air. If pure air is ever necessary, it is when any part of the system, [such] as the lungs or stomach, is diseased.

Brisk, yet not violent exercise in the open air, with cheerfulness of spirits, will promote the circulation, giving a healthful glow to the skin, and sending the blood, vitalized by the pure air, to the extremities.",
