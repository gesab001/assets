    "word": "Those who would be laborers together with God must receive wisdom from the Great Teacher who is our example in all things, in order to present the truth in its simplicity. Learn of Christ. All pride, all selfishness, all self-importance, must be cut away from all teachers. All the sang-froid, which is so common, the theatrical gestures, all lightness and trifling, all jesting and joking, must be seen by the one who wears Christ's yoke to be \"not convenient\"--an offense to God and a denial of Christ. It unfits the mind for solid thought and solid labor. It makes men inefficient, superficial, and spiritually diseased.",
