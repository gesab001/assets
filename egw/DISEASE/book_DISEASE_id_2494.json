    "word": "A brother who is blind and poor and diseased, and who is making every exertion to help himself that he may not be dependent, should be encouraged by his brethren in every way possible. But those who profess to be his brethren, who have the use of all their faculties, who are not dependent, but who so far forget their duty to be blind as to perplex and distress and hedge up his way, are doing a work which will require repentance and restoration before God will accept their prayers. And the church of God, who have permitted their unfortunate brother to be wronged, will be guilty of sin until they do all in their power to have the wrong righted.--Ibid., pp. 519, 520.",
