    "word": "As these anxious ones are being crowded back, Christ makes his way to them step by step, until he is close by their side. Tears of gladness and hope fall freely as they catch his attention, and look into the eyes expressing such tender pity and love for the weary mother as well as the suffering child. He invites her confidence, saying, \"What shall I do for you?\" She sobs out her great want, \"Master, that thou shouldest heal my child.\" She has shown her faith in urging \n\n\n                      -27- \n\nher way to him, though she did not know that he was making his way to her; and Christ takes the child from her arms. He speaks the word, and disease flees at his touch. The pallor of death is gone; the life-giving current flows through the veins; the muscles receive strength.",
