    "word": "Larger Number of Female Physicians Needed.--In our medical institutions there ought always to be women of mature age and good experience who have been trained to give treatments to the lady patients.  Women should be educated and qualified just as thoroughly as possible to become practitioners in the delicate diseases which afflict women, that their secret parts should not be exposed to the notice of men.  There should be a much larger number of lady physicians, educated not only to act as trained nurses, but also as physicians.  It is a most horrible practice, this revealing the secret parts of women to men, or men being treated by women.--SpT-B15 13, 14 (1911).",
