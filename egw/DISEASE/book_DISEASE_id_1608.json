WHITE ON THE SUBJECT OF HEALTH. THIS IS THEIR BACKGROUND: FIRST, THERE WAS THE HISTORIC HEALTH-REFORM VISION OF JUNE 6, 1863. NEXT, IN 1864, MRS. WHITE MADE HER FIRST PUBLISHED PRESENTATION OF THE SUBJECT IN A 30-PAGE ARTICLE ENTITLED \"HEALTH,\" IN SPIRITUAL GIFTS, VOLUME IV (CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN FACSIMILE REPRINT). THEN, IN 1865, SHE FURNISHED ONE ARTICLE FOR EACH OF A SERIES OF SIX PAMPHLETS COMPILED FROM VARIOUS WRITERS AND PUBLISHED UNDER THE TITLE HEALTH, OR HOW TO LIVE. THE SIX ELLEN G. WHITE ARTICLES WERE AN AMPLIFICATION OF THE 30-PAGE ARTICLE IN SPIRITUAL GIFTS OF THE YEAR BEFORE. MRS. WHITE MADE NO OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO THE HOW TO LIVE PAMPHLETS.",
