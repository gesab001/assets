    "word": "Sister White: The Lord will be best pleased when all our sanitariums discard flesh meat. We have reason now as never before to let meat alone, because animals are diseased. The subject can be presented from this standpoint, and it will have great effect. Ms 82, 1901, pp. 42-45. (\"Report of Interview of Dr. and Mrs. A. J. Sanderson with Ellen G. White,\" August 25, 1901.) \n                                                                           284\n {1MR 283.10}  \nLoyalty to Principle vs. Patronage \n\n\n     I have been strongly impressed to write something in regard to the St. Helena Sanitarium. This institution was established by the Lord's direction, and it is not to outlive its usefulness. It is to be a living institution, through which the light of truth shall be shed abroad. The same God who works in other places where our medical work is established is ready to work in the St. Helena Sanitarium. Much of His power is to be revealed in this institution. It is to grow to the full stature of what God desires it to be. . . .",
