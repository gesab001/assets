{"word": "Chap. 61 - Special Testimony Relating To Politics\n\nTo the Teachers and Managers of our Schools:--\n\n     Those who have charge of our institutions and our schools should guard themselves diligently, lest by their words and sentiments they lead the students into false paths. Those who teach the Bible in our churches and in our schools are not at liberty to unite in making apparent their prejudices for or against political men or measures, because by so doing they stir up the minds of others, leading each to advocate his favorite theory. There are among those professing to believe present truth some who will thus be stirred up to express their sentiments and political preferences, so that division will be brought into the church.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 475}
