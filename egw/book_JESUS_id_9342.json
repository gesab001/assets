{"word": "Heaven will never be reached by an easy-going people merely professing to be Christians. God calls for thorough work on the part of every one of His followers. . . . \n     By resolute self-denial, \n     By constant watchfulness, \n     By earnest prayer, \n     By the diligent use of every means of grace, \n     And by the help of Jesus Christ our Redeemer, \n          We shall come off victorious. \n     The rest in heaven is for the weary, \n     The crown for the brows of the warriors.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 82}
