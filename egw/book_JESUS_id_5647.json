{"word": "Our Attitude in Prayer \n\n     Both in public and in private worship, it is our privilege to bow on our knees before the Lord when we offer our petitions to Him. Jesus, our example, \"kneeled down, and prayed.\" [Luke 22:41.] Of His disciples it is recorded that they, too, \"kneeled down, and prayed.\" [Acts 9:40;  20:36; 21:5.] Paul declared, \"I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" [Ephesians 3:14.] In confessing before God the sins of Israel, Ezra knelt. [See Ezra 9:5.] Daniel \"kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God.\" [Daniel 6:10.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW", "page": 178}
