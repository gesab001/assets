    "word": "These faithful laborers, who for Christ's sake have given up worldly prospects, choosing poverty rather than pleasure or riches; who, forgetful of self, have labored earnestly to win souls to Christ; who have given liberally to advance various enterprises in the cause of God, and have then sunk down in the battle, wearied and ill, and with no means of support, must not be left to struggle on in poverty and suffering, or to feel that they are paupers. When sickness or infirmity comes upon them, let not our workers be burdened with the anxious query: \"What will become of my wife and little ones, now that I can no longer labor and supply their necessities?\" It is but just that provision be made to meet the needs of these faithful laborers and the needs of those who are dependent on them.",
