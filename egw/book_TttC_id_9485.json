    "word": "The way the Jewish teachers explained the Scriptures, their endless repetitions of maxims and fiction, called forth from Christ the words: \"This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth, and honoreth Me with their lips; but their heart is far from Me.\" They performed in the temple courts their round of service. They offered sacrifices typifying the great Sacrifice, saying by their ceremonies, \"Come, my Saviour;\" yet Christ, the One whom all these ceremonies represented, was among them, and they would not recognize nor receive Him. The Saviour declared: \"In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\" Matthew 15:8, 9.",
