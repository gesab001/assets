They had fellowship with Him in His suffering and humiliation, and it is His highest joy to have them with Him to be partakers of His glory. Christ claims the privilege of having His church with Him. \"I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.\" To have them with Him is according to covenant promise and agreement with His Father (RH Oct. 17, 1893).",
