{"word": "Many professing Christians of today are closing their hearts and minds to the Sun of Righteousness, whose bright beams would chase away the darkness and mist that exist there. They refuse the light, and make God\\92s requirements and will of secondary importance. In place of the rest day given them by Jehovah, they accept a counterfeit sabbath; they worship an idol, and transgress God\\92s holy law in trampling upon the Sabbath which He has instituted and blessed.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 136}
