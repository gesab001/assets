{"word": "All may come to Him, and receive of His fullness. He says, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). Then why not cast aside all unbelief and heed the words of Jesus? You want rest; you long for peace. Then say from the heart, \"Lord Jesus, I come, because Thou hast given me this invitation.\" Believe in Him with steadfast faith, and He will save you. Have you been looking unto Jesus, who is the author and finisher of your faith? Have you been beholding Him who is full of truth and grace? Have you accepted the peace which Christ alone can give? If you have not, then yield to Him, and through His grace seek for a character that will be noble and elevated. Seek for a constant, resolute, cheerful spirit. Feed on Christ, who is the bread of life, and you will manifest His loveliness of character and spirit. [SELECTED MESSAGES, BOOK 1, PP. 389-398.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "NL", "page": 29}
