{"word": "The care of souls is too important and solemn a work to be entrusted to men who are unacquainted \n239\nwith God, and who do not have a special, definite experience in seeking him through prayer, and exercising faith in him. All heaven is interested in this work, and how can Heaven's richest blessings fall upon those who labor in their own finite strength and wisdom, instead of seeking help from him whose grace and power constantly await their demand? The officers of our Conferences have neglected the praying part, and the exercise of that faith which would honor God and bring to them divine aid. There is an absence of soul-earnestness in prayer, a burden of supplication, that the Lord will give you wisdom, and pour upon you his Holy Spirit, that you may indeed be laborers together with him. Open your Bibles before God, and pray for divine enlightenment. Your Redeemer is waiting for you to call upon him in your necessity. He knows the solemn charge he has committed to you in giving you the care of souls. We are in times of peculiar danger from foes without and within, and God would have you alive to everything concerning your specific work. You need not try to do anything without the special help of your heavenly Father. He is waiting for you to call, that he may say, \\93Here I am.\\94 If you will seek, he says he will be found of you; his strength, his grace, and his righteousness will be given to the humble, contrite one who seeks him with all the heart.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 238}
