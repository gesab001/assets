{"word": "While these opposing influences are at work to lead away from the truth, away from conviction, away from heaven into the broad path of self-gratification, the agents of God are to work to save souls that are ready to perish. After wrestling with God in prayer, put on the armor, and engage in earnest labor for the conversion of souls. Let men see that with you truth is not a jest, but an eternal reality. You are to deal with principles as you have never dealt with them before. Scatter the seeds of truth with no sparing hand. Sow beside all waters. Have no prescribed limits which you will not pass, but [work] with all the powers that God has given you. Then the people will know you as a man who believes the truth, and to whom truth is a reality. Let not your faith fail. Bring your mind to the point of decision or shake yourself free from all slothfulness and inaction. . . . Hold fast. Leave no means untried. Work, and watch, and pray, and walk humbly with God.--Letter 6 1/2, Jan. 4, 1900, to a college Bible teacher and his wife.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 18}
