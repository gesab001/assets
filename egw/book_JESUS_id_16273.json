{"word": "Warning Against Despising God's Message \n\n     I would speak in warning to those who have stood for years resisting light [SEE APPENDIX.] and cherishing the spirit of opposition. How long will you hate and despise the messengers of God's righteousness? God has given \n                                                                           97\nthem His message. They bear the word of the Lord. There is salvation for you, but only through the merits of Jesus Christ. The grace of the Holy Spirit has been offered you again and again. Light and power from on high have been shed abundantly in the midst of you. Here was evidence, that all might discern whom the Lord recognized as His servants. But there are those who despised the men and the message they bore. They have taunted them with being fanatics, extremists, and enthusiasts. Let me prophesy unto you: Unless you speedily humble your hearts before God, and confess your sins, which are many, you will, when it is too late, see that you have been fighting against God. Through the conviction of the Holy Spirit, no longer unto reformation and pardon, you will see that these men whom you have spoken against have been as signs in the world, as witnesses for God. Then you would give the whole world if you could redeem the past, and be just such zealous men, moved by the Spirit of God to lift your voice in solemn warning to the world; and, like them, to be in principle firm as a rock. Your turning things upside down is known of the Lord. Go on a little longer as you have gone, in rejection of the light from heaven, and you are lost. \"The man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 96}
