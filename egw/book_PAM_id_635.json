{"word": "Principles of Conducting\n \n\n     The committee meeting should be just as much under the dictation of the Spirit as the prayer meeting.--I wish to say to you that the business which may be carried on at this meeting is just as much a part of the service of God as is prayer. The business meeting is to be just as much under the dictation of the Spirit as the prayer meeting. There is danger of our getting a sentimental, impulsive religion. Let the business transacted at this meeting stand forth in such sacredness that the heavenly host can approve of it. We are to guard most sacredly the business lines of our work. Every line of business carried on here is to be in accordance with the principles of heaven.--3SM 336.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 252}
