    "word": "I was shown still another woman who is not in union with the people whom God is leading out. The spirit of truth dwells not in her heart, and she has been busy doing the work which well pleases the enemy of all good, to distract and confuse minds. (I recognized this woman the last day of the meeting; she left before it closed.) She is a great talker, and is ever ready to hear and tell some new thing, dwelling upon what she calls others' wrongs; and she terms her evil surmisings discernment. She puts light for darkness, and darkness for light, and for a pretense makes long prayers. She loves to be approved and thought righteous, and has deceived some. She wishes to teach others, and thinks that God teaches her above others. But the truth has no place in her heart.",
