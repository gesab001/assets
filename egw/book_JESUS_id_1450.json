{"word": "Christ laid aside His glory and came to this earth to suffer for sinners. If we meet with hardships in our work, let us look to Him who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Then we shall not fail nor be discouraged. We shall endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ. Remember what He says of all true believers: \"We are laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" 1 Corinthians 3:9.-- Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 334, 335.
