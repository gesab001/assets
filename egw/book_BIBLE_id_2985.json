{"word": "Church Authority Not Vested in One Man.--When this power which God has placed in the church is accredited to one man, and he is invested with the authority to be judgment for other minds, then the true Bible order is \n\n130 \n\nchanged. Satan's efforts upon such a man's mind will be most subtle and sometimes overpowering, because through this mind he thinks he can affect many others. Your position on leadership is correct, if you give to the highest organized authority in the church what you have given to one man. God never designed that His work should bear the stamp of one man's mind and one man's judgment.--3T 493.(See 9T 260, 261.)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 129}
