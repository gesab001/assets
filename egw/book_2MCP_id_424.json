{"word": "When depression settles upon the soul, it is no evidence that God has changed. He is \"the same yesterday, and today, and forever.\" You are sure of the favor of God when you are sensible of the beams of the Sun of righteousness; but if the clouds sweep over your soul, you must not feel that you are forsaken. Your faith must pierce the gloom. Your eye must be single, and your whole body shall be full of light. The riches of the grace of Christ must be kept before the mind. Treasure up the lessons that His love provides. Let your faith be like Job's, that you may declare, \"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.\" Lay hold on the promises of your heavenly Father, and remember His former dealing with you and with His servants; for \"all things work together for good to them that love God.\" --RH, Jan 24, 1888.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 496}
