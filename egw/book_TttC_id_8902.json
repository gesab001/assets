    "word": "Prayer and Counsel \n\n     Those who labor at camp meetings should frequently engage together in prayer and counsel, that they may labor intelligently. At these meetings there are many things that demand attention. But the ministers should take time to meet together for prayer and counsel every day. You should know that all things are drawing in even lines, \"that you are standing,\" as the words were spoken to me, \"shoulder to shoulder, marching right ahead, and not drawing off.\" When the work is carried on in this way, there is unity of heart, and there will be harmony of action. This will be a wonderful means of bringing the blessing of God upon the people.",
