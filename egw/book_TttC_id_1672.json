    "word": "Men who profess the truth will engage in worldly enterprises, and invest much, and run great risks. If they lose nearly all they possess, they are deeply aggrieved, because they feel the inconvenience of the losses they have sustained; yet they do not feel that their unwise course has deprived the cause of God of means, and that as His stewards they must render an account for this squandering of the Lord's money. Should they be required to venture something for the cause of God, to invest a quarter even of that which they have lost by their investment in earthly things, they would feel that heaven costs too much.",
