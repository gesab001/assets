    "word": "52\n     I was told by my Guide: \"Look ye, and behold the idolatry of My people, to whom I have been speaking, rising up early, and presenting to them their dangers.

Both near and afar off souls are perishing for the bread of life and the water of salvation.\" When Satan is defeated in one line, he will be all ready with other schemes and plans which will appear attractive and needful, and which will absorb money and thought, and encourage selfishness, so that he can overcome those who are so easily led into a false and selfish indulgence.",
