{"word": "An Impressive Baptismal Service.--The efforts put forth in Oakland have borne fruit in the salvation of precious souls. Sunday morning, December 16, I attended a baptismal service at the Piedmont Baths. Thirty-two candidates were buried with their Lord in baptism, and arose to walk in newness of life. This was a scene that angels of God witnessed with joy. . . . The entire service was impressive. There was no confusion, and occasionally a verse of some hymn of praise was sung.--Manuscript 105, 1906.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 315}
