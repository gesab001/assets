{"word": "Love Favorably Interprets Another's Motives. --Charity \"doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil\" (1 Corinthians 13:5). Christlike love places the most favorable construction on the motives and acts of others. It does not needlessly expose their faults; it does not listen eagerly to unfavorable reports, but seeks rather to bring to mind the good qualities of others.--AA 319 (1911).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 209}
