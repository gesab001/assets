{"word": "Reaction to Ironclad Rules.--Into your discipline bring not a particle of harshness. Lay no rigid injunctions on the youth. It is these ironclad rules and commands that sometimes lead them to feel that they must and will do the thing they are charged not to do. When giving caution or reproof to the youth, do it as one who has a special interest in them. Let them see that you have an earnest desire for them to make a good record in the books of heaven.--Lt 67, 1902. (MM 180).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 284}
