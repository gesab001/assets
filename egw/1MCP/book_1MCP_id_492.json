{"word": "Love Stimulates to Nobler Aims.--Let each give love rather than exact it. Cultivate that which is noblest in yourselves, and be quick to recognize the good qualities in each other.

Sympathy and respect encourage the striving after excellence, and love itself increases as it stimulates to nobler aims.--MH 361 (1905).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 154}
