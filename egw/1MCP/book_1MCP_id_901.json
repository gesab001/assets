{"word": "Peter exhorts his brethren: \"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.\" The apostle Paul also exhorts his Philippian brethren to unity and humility: \"If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of \n\n270 \n\none mind. Let nothing be done through strife or vain-glory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.\"--3T 360 (1875).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 269}
