{"word": "The Rapture of Feeling No Evidence of Conversion. --Satan leads people to think that because they have felt a rapture of feeling, they are converted. But their experience does not change. Their actions are the same as before. Their lives show no good fruit. They pray often and long and are constantly referring to the feelings they had at such a time. But they do not live the new life. They are deceived. Their experience goes no deeper than feeling. They build upon the sand, and when adverse winds come, their house is swept away.--YI, Sept. 26, 1901. (4BC 1164.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 127}
