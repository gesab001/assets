{"word": "Christianity in Home Shines Everywhere.--The effort to make the home what it should be--a symbol of the home in heaven--prepares us for work in a larger sphere. The education received by showing a tender regard for each other enables us to know how to reach hearts that need to be taught the principles of true religion. The church needs all the cultivated spiritual force which can be obtained, that all, and especially the younger members of the Lord's family, may be carefully guarded. The truth lived at home makes itself felt in disinterested labor abroad. He who lives Christianity in the home will be a bright and shining light everywhere. --ST, Sept 1, 1898. (AH 38, 39.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 176}
