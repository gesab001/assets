{"word": "Control Conscience and Cultivate an Amiable Disposition.--We should all cultivate an amiable disposition and subject ourselves to the control of conscience. The spirit of the truth makes better men and women of those who receive it in their hearts. It works \n\n320 \n\nlike leaven till the entire being is brought into conformity to its principles. It opens the heart that has been frozen by avarice; it opens the hand that has ever been closed to human suffering; and charity and kindness are seen as its fruits.--4T 59 (1876).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 319}
