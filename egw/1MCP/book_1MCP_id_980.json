{"word": "Passion Destroys Everything.--The words of Christ should ever be borne in mind: \"As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank\" (Luke 17:26, 27). Appetite bears sway over mind and conscience in this age. Gluttony, winebibbing, liquor drinking, tobacco using prevail, but Christ's followers will be temperate in eating and drinking. They will not indulge appetite at the expense of health and spiritual growth.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 297}
