{"word": "Parents Never to Forfeit Self-respect by Thoughtless Words.--Let not one word of fretfulness, harshness, or passion escape your lips. The grace of Christ awaits your demand. His Spirit will take control of your heart and conscience, presiding over your words and deeds. Never forfeit your self-respect by hasty, thoughtless words. See that your words are pure, your conversation holy. Give your children an example of that which you wish them to be. . . . Let there be peace, pleasant words, and cheerful countenances.--Lt 28, 1890. (CG 219.) \n\n258", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 257}
