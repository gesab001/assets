{"word": "There are needed for this time well-balanced minds, healthy, wholesome Christians. Many of those who profess Christ have a sickly experience. They cannot bear anything unfavorable. They lose heart if they think they are in any way slighted or hurt, if their brethren have not been as tender with them as they think they should be. The Great Physician would, by His infinite skill, restore them to \n\n50 \n\nsound moral health; but the patient refuses to take the prescription He offers.

They soon come under influences which suit their natural tastes and counteract all they have gained.--RH, July 28, 1896.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 49}
