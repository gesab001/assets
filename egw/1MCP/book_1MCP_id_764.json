{"word": "The lust of the eye and corrupt passions are aroused by beholding and by reading. . . . The mind takes pleasure in contemplating scenes which awaken the lower and baser passions. These vile images, seen through defiled imagination, corrupt the morals and prepare the deluded, infatuated beings to give loose rein to lustful passions. Then follow sins and crimes which drag beings formed in the image of God down to a level with the beasts, sinking them at last in perdition. Avoid reading and seeing things which will suggest impure thoughts. Cultivate the moral and intellectual powers.--2T 410 (1870).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 229}
