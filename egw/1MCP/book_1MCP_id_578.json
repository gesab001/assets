{"word": "Angels Not Attracted to Discordant Home.--Angels are not attracted to the home where discord reigns supreme. Let fathers and mothers cease all faultfinding and murmuring. Let them educate their children to speak pleasant words, words that bring sunshine and joy. Shall we not now enter the home-school as Christ's students? Bring practical godliness into the home. Then see if the words you speak do not cause joy.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 179}
