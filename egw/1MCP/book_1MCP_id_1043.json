{"word": "Frivolity a Danger.--One pattern only is given to the young, but how do their lives compare with the life of \n\n316 \n\nChrist? I feel alarmed as I witness everywhere the frivolity of young men and young women who profess to believe the truth. God does not seem to be in their thoughts. Their minds are filled with nonsense. Their conversation is only empty, vain talk. They have a keen ear for music, and Satan knows what organs to excite to animate, engross, and charm the mind so that Christ is not desired. The spiritual longings of the soul for divine knowledge, for a growth in grace, are wanting.--1T 496, 497 (1867).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 315}
