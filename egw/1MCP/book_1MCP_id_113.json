{"word": "God Works No Miracle to Prevent Harvest.--The Lord sends us warning, counsel, and reproof that we may have opportunity to correct our errors before they become second nature. But if we refuse to be corrected, God does not interfere to counteract the tendencies of our own course of action. He works no miracle that the seed sown may not spring up and bear fruit.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 35}
