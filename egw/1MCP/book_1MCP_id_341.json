{"word": "Despotic Power of Infidel Authors (words from the angel instructor).--Human minds are easily charmed by Satan's lies; and these works produce a distaste for the contemplation of the Word of God, which if received and appreciated, will ensure eternal life to the receiver. You are creatures of habit and should remember that right habits are blessings both in their effect on your own character and in their influence for good over others; but wrong habits, when once established, exercise a despotic power and bring minds into bondage. If you had never read one word in these books [by infidel authors] you would today be far better able to comprehend that Book which, above all other books, is worthy to be studied and which gives the only correct ideas regarding higher education.--6T 162 (1900). \n\n110", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 109}
