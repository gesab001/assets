{"word": "Chap. 8 - Religion and the Mind\n[SEE CHAPTER\n43, \"MIND AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH.\"]\n\n\n     The Love of Christ Vitalizes the Whole Being.--The love which Christ diffuses through the whole being is a vitalizing power. Every vital part--the brain, the heart, the nerves--it touches with healing. By it the highest energies of the being are aroused to activity. It frees the soul from the guilt and sorrow, the anxiety and care, that crush the life-forces. With it come serenity and composure. It implants in the soul, joy that nothing earthly can destroy--joy in the Holy Spirit--health-giving, life-giving joy.--MH 115 (1905).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 65}
