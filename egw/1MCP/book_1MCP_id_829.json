{"word": "Your Love for Souls Measures Your Love for God. --The love revealed in Christ's life of self-denial and self-sacrifice is to be seen in the lives of His followers. We are called \"so to walk, even as He walked.\". . .  It is our privilege to stand with the light of heaven upon us. It was thus that Enoch walked with God. It was no easier for Enoch to live a righteous life than it is for us at the present time. The world in his time was no more favorable to growth in grace and holiness than it is now. . . . We are living in the perils of the last days, and we must receive our strength from the same source. We must walk with God. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 245}
