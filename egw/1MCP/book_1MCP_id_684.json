{"word": "Love and Self-discipline Bind Family Together.--Let parents seek, in their own character and in their homelife, to exemplify the love and beneficence of the heavenly Father. Let the home be full of sunshine. This will be worth far more to your children than lands or money. Let the home love be kept alive in their hearts, that they may look back upon the home of their childhood as a place of peace and happiness next to heaven. The members of the family do not all have the same stamp of character, and there will be frequent occasion for the exercise of patience and forbearance; but through love and \n\n214 \n\nself-discipline all may be bound together in the closest union.--PP 176 (1890).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 213}
