{"word": "Gospel Versus Science and Literature.--Science and literature cannot bring into the darkened mind of men the light which the glorious gospel of the Son of God can bring. The Son of God alone can do the great work of illuminating the soul. No wonder Paul exclaims, \"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth\" (Romans 1:16). The gospel of Christ becomes personality in those who believe, and makes them living epistles, known and read of all men. In this way the leaven of godliness passes into the multitude. The heavenly intelligences are able to discern the true elements of greatness in character, for only goodness is esteemed as efficiency with God.--RH, Dec 15, 1891.
