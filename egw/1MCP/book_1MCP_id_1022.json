{"word": "They were not industrious and persevering and did not go to the bottom of things. They were not willing to \n\n310 \n\nbegin at the bottom of the ladder, and with patient toil, ascend round after round till they reached the top. They walked in the sparks of their own kindling. They did not depend on the wisdom which God alone can give. Their failure was not because they did not have a chance, but because they were not sober-minded. They did not feel that their educational advantages were of value to them, and so did not advance as they might have advanced in the knowledge of religion and science. Their mind and character were not balanced by high principles of right.-- RH, Dec 8, 1891. (FE 193.)", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 309}
