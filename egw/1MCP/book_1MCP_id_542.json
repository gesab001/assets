{"word": "Your Child Is the Property of God.--My sister, can you be surprised that your daughter has little confidence in her mother's word? You have educated her to be untruthful; and the Lord is grieved to see one of His little ones led in the wrong path by her mother. Your child is not your own; you cannot do with her as you like, for she is the property of the Lord. Exercise a steady persevering control over her; teach her that she belongs to God. With such a training she will grow up to be a blessing to those around her. But clear, sharp discernment will be necessary in order that you may repress her inclination to rule you both, to have her own will and way, and to do as she pleases.--Lt 69, 1896.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 169}
