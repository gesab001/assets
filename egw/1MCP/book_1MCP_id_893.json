{"word": "Duty to Obey Individual Religious Convictions.-- Many are the ways by which Satan works through human influence to bind his captives. He secures multitudes to himself by attaching them by the silken cords of affection to those who are enemies of the cross of Christ. Whatever this attachment may be--parental, filial, conjugal, or social--the effect is the same; the opposers of truth exert their power to control the conscience, and the souls held under their sway have not sufficient courage or independence to obey their own convictions of duty.-- GC 597 (1911).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 267}
