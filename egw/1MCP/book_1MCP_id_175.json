{"word": "Balance of Differing Minds Necessary.--Here we are brought together--of different minds, different education, and different training--and we do not expect that every mind will run right in the same channel; but the \n\n54 \n\nquestion is, Are we, the several branches, grafted into the parent Vine? That is what we want to inquire, and we want to ask teachers as well as students. We want to understand whether we are really grafted into the parent Vine. If we are, we may have different manners, different tones, and different voices. You may view things from one standpoint, and we have ideas different from one another in regard to the Scriptures, not in opposition to the Scriptures, but our ideas may vary. My mind may run in the lines most familiar to it, and another may be thinking and taking a view according to his traits of character, and see a very deep interest in one side of it that others do not see.--MS 14, 1894.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 53}
