{"word": "Every Sin Cherished Weakens the Character.--And let none flatter themselves that sins cherished for a time can easily be given up by and by. This is not so. Every sin cherished weakens the character and strengthens habit; \n\n14 \n\nand physical, mental, and moral depravity is the result. You may repent of the wrong you have done, and set your feet in right paths; but the mold of your mind and your familiarity with evil will make it difficult for you to distinguish between right and wrong. Through the wrong habits formed, Satan will assail you again and again.-- COL 281 (1900).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 13}
