{"word": "Deal Gently With Little Ones.--Mothers, deal gently with your little ones. Christ was once a little child. For His sake honor the children. Look upon them as a sacred charge, not to be indulged, petted, and idolized but to be taught to live pure, noble lives. They are God's property; He loves them and calls upon you to cooperate with Him in helping them to form perfect characters.--ST, Aug. 23, 1899. (AH 280.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 169}
