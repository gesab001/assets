{"word": "Respond to Suggestion.--No recreation helpful only to themselves will prove so great a blessing to the children and youth as that which makes them helpful to others. Naturally enthusiastic and impressible, the young are quick to respond to suggestion. In planning for the culture of plants, let the teacher seek to awaken an interest in beautifying the school grounds and the schoolroom. A double benefit will result. That which the pupils seek to beautify they will be unwilling to have marred or defaced. A refined taste, a love of order, and a habit of caretaking will be encouraged; and the spirit of fellowship and cooperation developed will prove to the pupils a lifelong blessing.--Ed 212, 213 (1903).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 291}
