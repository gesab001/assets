{"word": "Depend Upon God, Not Man.--God desires to bring men into direct relation with Himself. In all His dealings with human beings He recognizes the principle of personal responsibility. He seeks to encourage a sense of personal dependence and to impress the need of personal guidance. He desires to bring the human into association with the divine that men may be transformed into the divine likeness. Satan works to thwart this purpose. He seeks to encourage dependence upon men. When minds are turned away from God, the tempter can bring them \n\n262 \n\nunder his rule. He can control humanity.--MH 242, 243 (1905).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 261}
