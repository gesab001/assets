{"word": "Satan Watching for Unguarded Minds.--Satan is watching that he may find the mind in an unguarded moment, and so get possession of it. We do not want to be ignorant of his devices, neither do we want to be overpowered by his devices. He is pleased with the pictures that represent him as having horns and hooves, for he has intelligence; he was once an angel of light.--MS 11, 1893.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 24}
