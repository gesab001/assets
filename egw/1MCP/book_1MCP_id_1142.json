{"word": "Few Evils More to Be Dreaded.--Few evils are more to be dreaded than indolence and aimlessness. Yet the tendency of most athletic sports is a subject of anxious thought to those who have at heart the well-being of the youth. . . . They stimulate the love of pleasure and excitement, thus fostering a distaste for useful labor, a disposition to shun practical duties and responsibilities.

Thus the door is opened to dissipation and lawlessness, with their terrible results. --Ed 210, 211 (1903).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 344}
