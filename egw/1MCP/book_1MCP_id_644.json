{"word": "Dealing With the Dull Scholar.--Teachers must consider that they are dealing with children, not men and women. They are children who have everything to learn, and it is much more difficult for some to learn than others. The dull scholar needs much more encouragement than he receives. If teachers are placed over these varied minds who naturally love to order and dictate and magnify themselves in their authority, who will deal with partiality, having favorites to whom they will show preferences while others are treated with exactitude and severity, it will create a state of confusion and insubordination.--CEd 154, 1893.
