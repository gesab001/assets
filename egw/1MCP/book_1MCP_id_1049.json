{"word": "Avoid Temptations.--Avoid running into temptation. When temptations surround you, and you cannot control the circumstances which expose you to them, then you may claim the promise of God and with confidence and conscious power exclaim, \"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me\" (Philippians 4:13). There is strength for you all in God. But you will never feel your need of that strength which alone is able to save you unless you feel your weakness and sinfulness.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 317}
