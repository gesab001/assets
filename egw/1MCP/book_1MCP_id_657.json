{"word": "Love Not an Impulse but a Divine Principle.-- Supreme love for God and unselfish love for one another--this is the best gift that our heavenly Father can bestow. This love is not an impulse but a divine principle, a permanent power. The unconsecrated heart cannot originate or produce it. Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it found. \"We love Him, because He first loved us\" (1 John 4:19). In the heart renewed by divine grace, love is the ruling principle of action.--AA 551 (1911).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 206}
