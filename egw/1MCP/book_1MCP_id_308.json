{"word": "Chap. 12 - Diligence\n[SEE CHAPTER 65, \"INDOLENCE.\"]\n\n\n     Strive and Achieve.-- It is hard study, hard toil,  persevering diligence, that obtain victories. Waste no hours, no moments. The results of work--earnest, faithful work--will be seen and appreciated. Those who wish for stronger minds can gain them by diligence. The mind increases in power and efficiency by use. It becomes strong by hard thinking. He who uses most diligently his mental and physical powers will achieve the greatest results. Every power of the being strengthens by action.--RH, Mar 10, 1903.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 99}
