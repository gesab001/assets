{"word": "Talk of Subjects Upon Which Minds Run.--With many young ladies the boys are the theme of conversation; with the young men, it is the girls. \"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh\" (Matthew 12:34). They talk of those subjects upon which their minds mostly run. The recording angel is writing the words of these professed Christian boys and girls. How will they be confused and ashamed when they meet them again in the day of God! Many children are pious hypocrites. The youth who have not made a profession of religion stumble over these hypocritical ones and are hardened against any effort that may be made by those interested in their salvation.--2T 460 (1870).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 300}
