{"word": "A soul filled with the love of Jesus lends to the words, the manners, the looks, hope, courage, and serenity.... It awakens a desire for a better life; souls ready to faint are strengthened; those struggling against temptation will be fortified and comforted. The words, the expression, the manners, throw out a bright ray of sunshine, and leave behind them a clear path toward heaven. . . . Every one of us has opportunities of helping others. We are constantly making impressions upon the youth about us. The expression of the countenance is itself a mirror of the life within. Jesus desires that we shall become like Himself, filled with tender sympathy, exerting a ministry of love in the small duties of life. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 175}
