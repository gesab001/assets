{"word": "Letters have come from mothers, relating their trials at home and asking my counsel.  One of these cases will serve to represent many.  The husband and father is not a believer, and everything is made hard for the mother in the training of her children.  The husband is a profane man, vulgar and abusive in his language to herself, and he teaches the children to disregard her authority. When she is trying to pray with them he will come in and make all the noise he can, and break out into cursing God and heaping vile epithets upon the Bible.  She is so discouraged that life is a burden to her.  What good can she do?   What benefit is it to her children for her to remain at home?  She has felt an earnest desire to do some work in the Lord's vineyard, and has thought that it might be best to leave her family, rather than to remain while the husband and father is constantly teaching the children to disrespect and disobey her.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSB", "page": 43}
