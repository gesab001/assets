{"word": "Jesus, Only Hope of Sinners. The bewitching power of Satan has been upon you. But make no delay; Jesus is at the right hand of God and mercy still lingers. \"Come now,\" says the Lord, \"and let us reason together; . . . though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool\" [Isaiah 1:18]. Yes, Jesus is the sinner's only hope. \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money (no goodness, no righteousness, nothing to recommend him to God); come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price\" [Isaiah 55:1]. \n                                                                           143", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TSB", "page": 142}
