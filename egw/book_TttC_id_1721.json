TWO MEN WHO HAD BEEN PREACHING THE MESSAGE WERE REPROVED THROUGH THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY FOR A HARSH, CENSORIOUS SPIRIT, FOR AVARICE, AND FOR EXTRAVAGANCE IN THE USE OF MEANS PLACED IN THEIR HANDS. BECOMING EMBITTERED INSTEAD OF REPENTANT, THEY JOINED WITH A FEW OTHERS IN UNJUST RECRIMINATION AGAINST ELDER AND MRS. WHITE AND OTHER LEADERS, MAKING FALSE CHARGES AGAINST THEM.
