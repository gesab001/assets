    "word": "All that you have and are belongs to God. Then will you not say from the heart: \"All things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee\"? \"Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase.\" Paul thus exhorts his Corinthian brethren to Christian beneficence: \"As ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.\" In his epistle to Timothy he says: \"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\"",
