    "word": "God has given us specific directions so that no one need err. \"Man shall not live by bread alone,\" He says, \"but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" The truth given by inspiration \"is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.\" Not by one word, not by many words, but by every word that God has spoken, shall man live. You cannot disregard one word, a single injunction that He has given, however trifling it may seem to you, and be safe. \"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" Whosoever will willfully break one command cannot in spirit and in truth keep any of them. He may claim that, with the exception of what he may regard as slight deviations, he keeps them all; yet if he willingly offends in one point he is guilty of all.",
