{"word": "\"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\" It is not the magnitude of the matter that makes it fair or unfair. As a man deals with his fellow men, so will he deal with God. He that is unfaithful in the mammon of unrighteousness, will never be entrusted with the true riches. The children of God should not fail to remember that in all their business transactions they are being proved, weighed in the balances of the sanctuary.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4T", "page": 311}
