{"word": "Chapter XVI. - Sermon on the Mount.\n\n     The Redeemer of the world sought to make his lessons so simple that all could understand who heard them. It was not his choice to teach within walls or temples. True, he often did so in order to reach a class whom he would not be likely to meet while speaking in the open air, but Jesus preferred the fields, the groves, and the lake-sides for his temples. There were also his favorite resorts for meditation and prayer.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 200}
