{"word": "8. THIS BEAST CAUSES BOTH \"THE EARTH AND THEM WHICH DWELL THEREIN TO WORSHIP THE FIRST BEAST.\" THIS CAN BE EASILY REFERRED TO LAWS COMPELLING THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SUNDAY INSTEAD OF THE SABBATH OF THE LORD,--THE SEVENTH DAY. THE SUNDAY-SABBATH INSTITUTION IS TRACED DIRECTLY TO THE ROMISH CHURCH, WHICH, INDEED, CLAIMS THE HONOR OF ORIGINATING IT; AND NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DISPUTE THIS CLAIM. THE SABBATH OF JEHOVAH COMMEMORATES THE CREATION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH, AND THE COMMANDMENT FOR ITS OBSERVANCE WAS GIVEN THAT THE EARTH AND ITS INHABITANTS MIGHT GLORIFY THE CREATOR. THE LAW WHICH COMPELS THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SUNDAY-SABBATH ANNULS THE COMMANDMENT OF GOD, AND THE EARTH AND THEM THAT DWELL THEREIN ARE CAUSED TO DO HOMAGE TO THE POWER WHICH ORIGINATED IT, BY RESTING THEREON. PROTESTANTS HAVE ASCRIBED VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS TO THE PAPACY, AND APPLIED THIS PROPHECY TO THEM; BUT IN NONE IS THE EARTH, IN DISTINCTION FROM THOSE WHO DWELL UPON THE EARTH, CAUSED TO WORSHIP THAT POWER, EXCEPT IN THE SUNDAY REST ENFORCED UPON ALL THE LAND.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 503}
