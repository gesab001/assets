{"word": "Teach the youth that sin in any line is defined in the Scriptures as \"transgression of the law.\" 1 John 3:4. . . . Teach them in simple language that they must be obedient to their parents and give their hearts to God. Jesus Christ is waiting to accept and bless them if they will only come to Him and ask Him to pardon all their transgressions and take away their sins. And when they ask Him to pardon all their transgressions they must believe that He does it.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 169}
