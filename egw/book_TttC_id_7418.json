    "word": "In the instruction given by our Saviour to His disciples are words of admonition especially applicable to us: \"Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.\" Watch, pray, work--this is the true life of faith. \"Pray always;\" that is, be ever in the spirit of prayer, and then you will be in readiness for your Lord's coming.",
