{"word": "Chap. 10 - The Visions of Anna Phillips\n[IN\n1893 ANNA PHILLIPS, A YOUNG WOMAN RESIDING IN\nBATTLE CREEK, WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT HER IMPRESSIONS\nAND DREAMS WERE THE INTIMATIONS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD.\nSHE WAS ENCOURAGED IN HER WORK WHEN HER SO-CALLED\nTESTIMONIES, PLACED IN THE HANDS OF A LEADING WORKER,\nWERE READ BY HIM BEFORE THE BATTLE CREEK CHURCH AS\nDIVINELY INSPIRED COMMUNICATIONS. THE NEXT MORNING\nTHIS WORKER RECEIVED THE COMMUNICATION HERE PRESENTED.\nON HEARING THIS READ, ANNA PHILLIPS DISCERNED AND\nACKNOWLEDGED THE DELUSION, REPUDIATED HER PAST WORK,\nAND BECAME A TRUSTED, FRUITFUL BIBLE INSTRUCTOR IN\nTHE WORK OF THE CHURCH.--COMPILERS.]\n-\n\n           Does Not Bear Signature of Heaven \n\n     I know that we are living near the close of this earth's history; startling events are preparing for development. I am fully in harmony with you in your work when you present the Bible, and the Bible alone, as the foundation of our faith. Satan is an artful foe, and he will work where he is by many least expected. I have a message for you. Did you suppose that God had commissioned you to take the burden of presenting the visions of Anna Phillips, reading them in public, and uniting them with the testimonies the Lord has been pleased to give me? No, the Lord has not laid upon you this burden. He has not given you this work to do. . . . Do not belittle the work by mingling with it productions that you have no positive evidence are from the Lord of life and glory. . . . \n                                                                           86", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 85}
