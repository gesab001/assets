{"word": "The example of Christ is left on record for His followers. Jesus was Himself a source of blessing and strength. He could heal the sick and raise the dead; He commanded even the tempests, and they obeyed Him; He was unsullied with corruption, a stranger to sin; yet He endured agony which required help and support from His Father, and He prayed often with strong crying and tears. He prayed for His disciples and for Himself, thus identifying Himself with the needs, the weaknesses, and the failings which are common to humanity. He was a mighty petitioner, not possessing the passions of our human, fallen natures, but compassed with like infirmities, tempted in all points even as we are. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 258}
