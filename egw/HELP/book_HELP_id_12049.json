    "word": "Sara and I rode to Martinsville for oranges. We were unable to get the fruit where we usually obtain it. The poor afflicted man has injured himself in falling and is quite sick and helpless. There was no one to pick the oranges for us. We rode to Mr. Kulda's and could get only five dozen. Then we came back to Martinsville and obtained all we wanted at another place. We took with us the children, May's babies, and we enjoyed the ride.",
