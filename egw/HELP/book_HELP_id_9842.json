    "word": "At the General Conference last spring, I repeated that which had been shown me in Vermont, Dec. 10, 1871, that my husband had pondered over the past trials of \n                                                                           89\nhis life too much. They looked to him unnecessary and unjust. He thought of the little sympathy and help he had received from Brn. Waggoner and Andrews, while bearing the heavy God had laid upon him, and the course of his brethren looked so mysterious and unexplainable in his mind that his confidence was shaken in almost everybody. He dwelt upon his trials and the neglect of his brethren until their errors were magnified before him, and he viewed them in a wrong light. His feelings were at times strong, and he was unreconciled to standing in the position he had done. He dwelt upon the inconsistent course of his brethren and their errors, when he should have been talking hope, courage, and faith, to his brethren. My husband was discouraged, and disappointed in his brethren, and Satan kept his mind dwelling upon these things until they became magnified in his mind. The effect of these thoughts was to dishearten, and take away courage and hope, and greatly injure his health. He thought at times that the ways of the Lord were not equal in his bearing burdens which were crushing him, while his ministering brethren, Andrews, Waggoner, and Smith, excused themselves from taking their share of these responsibilities.",
