On our way to San Diego, we stopped off at Fernando, and we spent a few days at Loma Linda. At the Paradise Valley Sanitarium we found a very small patronage. Twice I spoke to the helpers and guests. On Sabbath and Sunday, May 4 and 5, I spoke to the church in San Diego. I bore a very plain testimony. Sunday afternoon, I followed an earnest appeal with a prayer. This was followed by a social meeting at which some confessions were made. . . .",
