    "word": "To make straight paths for our feet, this is our work. \"Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith.\" He will be with us every day as we advance in the narrow path, and through the straight gate that leads to life everlasting. He will be your Helper and your Strength. Let us praise Him more. We all have received very much for which to praise Him. Then let us talk much of Him, and let us love Him.",
