    "word": "\"You neglected the widow and the fatherless. In their destitution they cried for help but in your luxuriance you heeded them not, and their cries have entered into My ears.

You loved to be thought rich, but your riches accumulated by the withholding of My money from the poor. This will make you the poorest man on earth.",
