    "word": "This [James 5:1-6, just quoted] is the state of the world today. Men are grasping at all they can possibly obtain, paying their laborers the lowest prices, while they expect the highest prices themselves. Selfishness, avariciousness, and covetousness, which is idolatry, are cherished. Thousands of dollars are locked up, where they are of no use to anyone. Those who own this money live in a state of continual worry lest they will lose their treasure. Thus the Lord's entrusted capital fails to bring an increase to Him. God says, Put it out to usury. Use it to benefit and bless someone who in his turn will benefit someone else. By the blessing of God money put into circulation to help others steadily increases, multiplying itself.--Letter 131, 1900, p. 13. (To A. G. Daniells, October 14, 1900.)",
