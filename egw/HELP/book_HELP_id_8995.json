    "word": "In past years, you have taken a special interest in the upbuilding of the Melrose sanitarium, and the Lord has blessed your efforts. He will still help you, if you will do His will. Do not, I beseech of you, break away from Melrose now, when you have before you so many wonderful opportunities for service. The Lord has a special work for you to do in Boston. The standard of present truth is to be exalted in that great city, and, in God's providence, you and your colaborers are situated where you can co-operate with others in doing a noble and far-reaching work in that important center of influence.",
