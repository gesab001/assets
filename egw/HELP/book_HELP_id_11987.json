    "word": "If Satan can keep the human agent intoxicated with worldly ambition and worldly plans, he is well pleased. We deprive ourselves of the greatest blessings by failing to cooperate with our Redeemer in seeking to raise the fallen race, by failing to be God's helping hand in the restoration of humanity. \"We are laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" [1 Corinthians 3:9]. He has made every sacrifice in our behalf, and shall we not make sacrifices to show our appreciation of the heavenly Gift?--Letter 97, 1901. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May 12, 1988. Entire Letter.",
