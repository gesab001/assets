    "word": "Money has a great value because it can do great good. Absolute necessities are met, and the faithful steward to God can bring relief at a time when help is needed. Money may be withheld from the treasury \"that there may be meat in Mine house.\" The Lord's money is misused in extravagance, in indulgence of appetite. This entrusted capital should be used to relieve human suffering, to clothe the naked, to feed the hungry, to advance the truth, to build up the kingdom of God in our world.",
