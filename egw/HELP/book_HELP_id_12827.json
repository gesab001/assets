    "word": "Is it so that if, when the Testimonies come to our brethren, they harmonize with their ideas and plans, they are confident that they are of God; but that if, when they come, they do not harmonize with their cherished plans, they regard them as of no special value? If this is so, how can the message I bear fulfill the purpose for which it is sent? What power to help is there in the message I bear if when leading men receive from me a communication that cuts across their plans, they have so little faith in the Testimonies as to say that I have been influenced by my son or by some member of my family, or by some one else high or afar off. It is hard for me to believe that this is a true measure of their confidence. When the testimonies reprove men of experience, who are bearing large responsibilities, are we to expect that they will endeavor to justify themselves, as others of less experience have done? This is the temptation to which many yield, and by yielding they lose the benefits and blessings that they might receive by accepting the message.",
