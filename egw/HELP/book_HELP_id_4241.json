    "word": "Those who continue in transgression will be judged according to their refusal of light. They choose to stand on the side of the prince of darkness, to become the helping hand of him who, if it were possible, would deceive the very elect. They refuse the wonderful gift of heaven, and though they may profess righteousness, and talk of \u201cadherence to principle,\u201d they are at the same time following principles opposed to the noble principles of heaven, and they teach others to follow the same corrupting principles.",
