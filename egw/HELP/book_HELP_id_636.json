    "word": "Such a man should not be placed on boards or committees.  He is constitutionally unfitted to make important decisions.  He is determined not to be convinced.  He will not yield to men of experience, and therefore he will be a hindrance, instead of a help.  He will suggest sentiments that are unsanctioned by the experience or judgment of men who are fully as intelligent and as wise as he is.  He will make assertions as though he had all the aftersight, and will uphold his ideas as all-sufficient.  Self has for so long been the ruling element, that the unfortunate man considers it a virtue to, as he thinks, have a mind of his own.  If his way is not followed, he will raise objections on every occasion, in small matters and in large.  He will hold to his words, whether they are true, or entirely false.  This practice, often repeated, grows into confirmed habit, and becomes character.--Manuscript 159, 1898, pp. 1, 2 (Dec. 8, 1898, \"Speak Evil of No Man\").",
