    "word": "God will be our helper and our strength. He will be our frontguard and our rearward. We may lean upon an arm that is almighty. With a sympathetic Saviour looking upon us, and pleading in our behalf, how can we lose faith? I ask you to pledge yourselves before God that you will not talk discouragement. Be determined never to go back on anything that you have tried to carry forward in the fear of God.",
