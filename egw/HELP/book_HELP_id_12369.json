    "word": "Christ could not help being bright and shining. His very work was to shine. \"I am come,\" He said, \"that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly\" [John 10:10]. \"In Me is no darkness at all\" [See 1 John 1:5]. With sadness Christ says that there are some who love not the light, because their deeds are evil. They do not come to Jesus to deliver them from the power of evil. Light means revelation, and the light is to shine amid moral darkness. Christ is everything to those who receive Him. He is their Comforter, their safety, their healthfulness. Apart from Christ there is no light at all.",
