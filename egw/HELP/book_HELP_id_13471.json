    "word": "(302) Nearly every morning we were there, the sky was overcast with fog. I rode out a short distance on Friday. That day I was quite sick, and very weak, and I hardly dared hope to be able to speak on the morrow. However, I ventured to allow the brethren to make an appointment for me to address the people Sabbath afternoon. I made the Lord my entire dependence; for I knew that unless He should be my helper, I could not speak more than a few words. I was afflicted with the influenza, and my throat and head were greatly troubled. I was so hoarse that I could scarcely talk.",
