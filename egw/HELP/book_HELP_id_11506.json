    "word": "April 11. I wrote the foregoing pages yesterday. This morning I found a letter from Willie under my door, saying that he will leave Mountain View \n\n\n                                   -258- \n\non Wednesday for Los Angeles, to attend important conference meetings in Fernando. After this, he will visit San Diego. There are important questions to be decided in regard to providing greater facilities for the accommodation of patients. This is most important medical missionary work to be done in our sanitariums. May the Lord help us and teach us and enable us to be a blessing to others.",
