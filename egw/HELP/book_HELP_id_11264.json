    "word": "Wake up, Sister Weber, and when you come near to God, He will draw near to you. Wake up and feel that God will help you. Let it be the language of your soul, He must increase, I must decrease. Put \"me\" and \"I\" just where they belong, and lift up Jesus, talk of Jesus. If He does not lie at the foundation of all your plans, if your eye is not single to the glory of God, and yourself obedient to all His requirements, keeping eternal realities in view, you are on the losing side.",
