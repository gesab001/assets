    "word": "We have every encouragement that if we daily surrender our wills to God, the promise will be fulfilled, \"And of His fullness have we all received, and grace for grace.\" Every revealing of the grace of Christ in our behalf is for us.

Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.\"",
