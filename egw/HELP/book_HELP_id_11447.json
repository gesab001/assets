    "word": "February 19. I could not sleep after twelve o'clock, and am now seated on my bed writing this to you. I thought I would catch up the little items \n\n\n                                  -19- \n\nas they occur. They will interest you, and I can send you a diary letter next mail. I pray most earnestly that your faith fail not under fire. All who are seeking to save perishing souls will have the power of darkness to contend with, but the Lord will not leave them nor forsake them. Help is laid upon One who is mighty to save.",
