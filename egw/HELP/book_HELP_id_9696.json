    "word": "\"Let your faith be strong in God. Look not upon appearances at this time. Brethren, \n                                                                           8\nGod is testing your faith, but let not your faith fail. Cling to promises, with full faith in the One back of the promise. My brethren, have faith in a living all pitiful, and loving Saviour. I have words given me for you and Brother-----, 'Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will keep thee; yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded, as a thing of naught. For I, the Lord will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, fear not; I will help thee. Fear not thou worm Jacob, ye men of Israel, saith the Lord and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.' Your business now is simply to trust in the Lord.\"",
