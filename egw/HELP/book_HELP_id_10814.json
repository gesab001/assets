    "word": "July 21:. . . My constant prayer is that I may be uplifted into a purer, holier atmosphere. I am pleading with God to remove my suffering. And although I continue to suffer, I am comforted by the thought that Jesus \n\n\n                                    -50- \n\nknows, and that He will help me. I shall see light in His light. My right arm is free from pain, and for this blessing I thank the Lord. The dear Saviour will not leave us nor forsake us. . . . He encourages us in all our afflictions, . . . and enables me to rejoice in His great mercy. . . .",
