    "word": "Concerning the Establishment of the SDA Church in Britain \n     Elder Andrews' time should be devoted some to old England, and not confined to the French. I have had considerable light. The strength, ability and means are needed more at the present crisis in our own country than in any other place. The heart of the work must be kept strong and in a vigorous helpful action. Then all branches of the work will have vitality. There must not be too much branching out, which calls for means, until the great center \n\n\n                                    -34- \n\nof the work is free from financial embarrassment. Elder Andrews is in danger of concentrating his mind, his means, and energies, upon one branch of the work, and not being sufficiently awake to other important interests.-- Letter 1, 1879, p. 2. (To S. N. Haskell, January 27, 1879.)",
