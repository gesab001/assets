    "word": "At the late camp-meeting at Oakland many came to me and inquired if there was nothing to be done in your case. The strong influence you had been exerting in behalf of these speculative enterprises, to the injury of the work of God, brought great trial and perplexity to our brethren. But notwithstanding the wrongs on your part that called for confession, you came to that meeting and held yourself aloof, neither seeking to right your wrongs, nor showing an interest in the work of God. You necessarily had some care of your wife, but this was no sufficient excuse. You needed all the help and blessing which the Lord was waiting to bestow upon you if you would seek him with humility of heart. If you were envious, dissatisfied,  feeling that due honor had not been shown you,  the Lord could do nothing for you. What conclusion could the people draw from your attitude at that meeting?  Had you, as a humble learner in the school of \n\n\n                      [73] \n\nChrist, tried to obtain all the help possible from your brethren and sisters, you would not at the close of the meeting have been barren and unblessed; you would not, when you left, have been under temptation, dissatisfied, and unhappy.",
