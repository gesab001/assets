    "word": "Become all that the Lord desires you to be--a gospel medical missionary. You are to be not only an increasingly skillful physician, but one of the Lord's appointed missionaries, in all your work placing His service first. Let nothing mar your peace. Give your heart's best and holiest affections to Him who gave His life that you might be among the redeemed family in the heavenly courts. Striving for the crown of life will not make you dissatisfied or less useful. The Great Teacher desires to acknowledge you as His helping hand. He calls for your co-operation. Will you not now give Him all that you \n                                                                           491\nhave and are? Will you not consecrate your talents to His service?",
