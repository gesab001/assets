    "word": "The Comforter Sent in Answer to the Prayer of Faith--At all times and in all places; in all sorrows and in all affliction, when the outlook seems dark, and the future perplexing, and souls feel helpless and alone, these are the times when the Comforter will be sent in answer to the prayer of faith. There is no more encouraging promise than this: \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it\" (John 14:13, 14). --Letter 89b, 1897, p. 2. (To Herbert and Lilian Lacey, March 22, 1897.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. July 17, 1980",
