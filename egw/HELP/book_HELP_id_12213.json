    "word": "There is a great work to be done in calling for volunteers for the canvassing work. Canvassers are not to be restricted by being told that they must not talk upon subjects of the truth, that they are to give no Bible readings. They are to put all their energies and enlightenment into the work, and if they can help anyone by speaking to him directly and personally, let them do it. They should be perfectly free to speak or to pray with those who are awakened. Some have not the burden to do this work, and they should not try to converse with those they meet, for they would be unable to enlighten them. The truth must go forward. The church militant is not the church triumphant. It has been shown me that those who are fitted to enlighten minds will often have opportunity to read from the Bible or from books which teach the truth, and thus bring the evidence of truth to enlighten souls.",
