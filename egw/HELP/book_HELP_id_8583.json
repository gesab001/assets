    "word": "New Durable Material Bought for Relief Work.--Some of our people say to me, \"Give away your old clothes, and that will help the poor.\" Should I give away the garments \n                                                                           329\nthat I patch and enlarge, the people would not be able to see anything of which they could make use. I buy for them new, strong, durable material. I have visited the factories where they make tweed cloth and have bought a number of remnants that perhaps have a flaw but can be purchased cheap, and will do some good to those to whom we give. I can afford to wear the old garments until they are beyond repair. I have purchased your uncle excellent cloth for pants and vest, and he is now supplied with good respectable clothing. In this way I can supply large families of children with durable garments, which the parents would not think of getting for them.--Ibid.",
