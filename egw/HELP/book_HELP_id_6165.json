    "word": "There is work for mothers in helping their children to form correct habits and pure tastes. Educate the appetite; teach the children to abhor stimulants.

Teach them that they are not to be swayed by others, that they are not to yield to strong influences, but to influence others for good.--The Ministry of Healing, pages 334, 335.",
