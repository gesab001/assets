    "word": "Be assured that I do not forget you. I pray for you, that the Lord will open up ways whereby you will be enabled to do good on Norfolk Island. I shall try to send you some money now and then. All that I have sent you since coming to this country has been hired on interest, but while I live, I will care for you. May the Lord give you peace and comfort. He is our only Hope and our only Helper. I shall be glad to hear from you as often as you can write, and I will write to you as often as I can. When it is not possible for me to write I will communicate to you through others. In this mail I will send you copies of letters I have written to the brethren in Australia. \n\n\n                                  -142-",
