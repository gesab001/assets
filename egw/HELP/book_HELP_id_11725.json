    "word": "Dr. Kellogg, I am perplexed to know what to do for means, but I do not ask you to take this burden upon you. God forbid that you should have any unnecessary burdens to bear. One thing I shall do: I shall make appeals to every church, irrespective of any persons in responsible positions. There is a work to be done in this country, and the people who have had the benefit of my husband's labor and my own in building up the work on the Pacific Coast and in Battle Creek must understand how hard we have labored, and help us. I do not call on the conference. I come to the people and appeal to them for help. If we can once get established, we shall work without assistance, but we must have help now. We cannot do without it.",
