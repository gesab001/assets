    "word": "I want to begin to do my talking at the beginning of the school year, because as I shall speak to you from time to time, I do not want you to feel that I have heard of your wrong course, and am hitting at you. I want to stand right by your side. I want to help every one of you. I present you before God in my prayers. I want you to take hold with me. How? \"Let him take hold of my strength,\" God says, \"that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me\" [Isaiah 27:5]. Daniel not only made peace with God, in making peace with God he made peace with one who knew not God.",
