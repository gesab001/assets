    "word": "\"Ye shall find rest.\" How? By living experience. Because God's yoke is a yoke of patience and gentleness and long-suffering. He, the Prince of the heavenly host, humbled himself. He took upon himself human nature, and stood at the head of humanity that he might teach fallen man how to be a partaker of the divine nature. Those who learn his meekness and lowliness learn also how to love one another as he has loved them. They will reach the place where they refuse to criticize and condemn others. They learn that there is committed to them a work that no one else can do for them, the work of learning of Christ. When we place ourselves in his hands, he shows us the possibilities and probabilities before us, and bids go for help to One infinitely higher than erring human beings.",
