    "word": "Temperance Sermons Will Reach Many.--Careful attention is to be given to helping those who are enslaved by evil habits. They are to hear discourses from the word of God concerning Christian temperance. We must lead them to the cross of Christ. Persons who have not entered a church for nearly a score of years have come to such gatherings and have been converted. The result was, they discarded tea and coffee, tobacco, beer, and liquor. Most marvelous changes in character have taken place. While many thus receive the light, others reject it, to their own eternal loss. This work costs time and wearing effort, and it causes much anguish of soul \n                                                                           243\nto see so many hear and understand, but, because of the cross, refuse to accept of Jesus Christ.--Manuscript 52, 1900.",
