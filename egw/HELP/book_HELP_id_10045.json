    "word": "The Holy Spirit indites all genuine prayer. I have learned to know that in all my intercessions, the Spirit intercedes for me and for all saints whose intercessions are according to the will of God, never contrary to His will. \"The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities\" [Romans 8:26], and the Spirit being God, knoweth the mind of God; therefore in every prayer of ours for the sick, or for other needs, the will of God is to be regarded. \"For what man knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God\" [2 Corinthians 2:11]. If we are taught of God, we shall pray in conformity to His revealed will and in submission to His will which we know not. We are to make supplication according to the will of God, relying on the precious Word, and believing that Christ not only gave Himself for, but to, His disciples. The record declares, \"He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost\" [John 20:22].",
