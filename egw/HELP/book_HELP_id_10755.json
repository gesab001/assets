    "word": "There are souls who are struggling with doubts, with none to enlighten them but those who understand the will of the Lord and appreciate His great sacrifice in the gift of His only begotten Son. The statement is, \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" He gave Him to live a life of humiliation, and to die an awful death that all mankind might hear His blessed invitation, and be brought near to God. What a work is given to those who will take up this work for fallen sinful beings. Go, says the great Teacher. Give them the message I have given you. Act the part that heaven has given you to act. I make you responsible for the bearing of this message. My angels will be with you to sustain you and to help you, giving you courage to surmount all difficulties, and distinguish the common from the sacred.--Ms 107, 1909, pp. 1-3.
