    "word": "Responsibilities are borne by men who have had no living experience in the rise and progress of the work. Brother Amadon and Elder Smith have had this experience, but Elder Smith is ensnared by the enemy and cannot in his present state give the trumpet a certain sound.

He is sowing seeds of unbelief that spring up and bear fruit for some souls to harvest.",
