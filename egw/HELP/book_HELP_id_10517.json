    "word": "The Lord Jesus loves those for whom He has given His life, and when worldly influences are allowed to come in between them and their Helper, when idols are chosen before Christ, when His appeals to the human soul are regarded with indifference, and there is no response, Jesus is grieved. . . . Those who will be the most highly honored are those who take up their cross daily, and follow Christ.--Manuscript 7, 1898, pp. 10, 11. (\"True Education in Our Churches,\" undated.)",
