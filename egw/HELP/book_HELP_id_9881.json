There is a work to be done for the leading men in our churches, ministers and helpers. I shall not at this time try to do more than tell you that every soul needs personal religion. Give your attention to yourselves, and make most earnest efforts to examine yourselves most critically whether ye be in the faith; \"prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in your, except ye be reprobates.\" \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\"",
