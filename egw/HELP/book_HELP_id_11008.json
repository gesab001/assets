    "word": "Parents, correct your children. Commence while they are young, when impressions can be made early and their evil temper subdued before it takes deep root and is strengthened with their strength. Correct your children in love. Do not correct them in passion or let them have their way until even you yourself are angry and then punish them. Correct your children, and then after you have done your duty, carry them to God and ask God to help you. Tell Him you have done your part, and then plead with Him to do His part, that you cannot do. Beg of Him to temper their dispositions, to make them mild and gentle by His Holy Spirit. God will hear you pray. He will love to answer your prayers. But He despises your prayers while you neglect your duty to your children and then pray Him to do the work for them. God corrects us when we go astray from Him, and you are bound to correct your children when they disobey you and show passion and an evil temper.",
