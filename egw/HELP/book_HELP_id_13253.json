    "word": "Edson, the Lord does not want you to worry and fret over a state of things that you can not help. He wants you to go on from strength to strength, and this you will do if you trustingly do your best. Learn a lesson of trust from the miracle of feeding the multitude with five loaves and two fishes. There were five thousand men, besides women and children, to be fed, and five loaves and two fishes were all that Christ had; yet there were gathered up, after all had been satisfied, twelve baskets full of fragments.",
