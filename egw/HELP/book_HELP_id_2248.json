    "word": "But above everything else it should be impressed upon the individuals who have decided to become God's servants, that they must be converted men. The heart must be pure. \n                                                                           110\nGodliness is essential for this life and the life which is to come. The man without a solid, virtuous character will surely be no honor to the cause of truth. The youth who contemplates laboring together with God, should be pure in heart. In his lips, in his mouth, should be no guile. The thoughts should be pure. Holiness of life and character is a rare thing, but this the worker must have or he cannot yoke up with Christ. Christ says, \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" If those who purpose to work for others' good and for the salvation of their fellow men rely on their own wisdom, they will fail. If they are entertaining humble views of themselves, then they are simple enough to believe in God and expect His help. \"Lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.\" Then we have the privilege of being directed by a wise counselor, and increased understanding is given to the true, sincere seeker for truth and for knowledge.",
