    "word": "We are called upon by the Lord to preach the truth without delay. All the country between the places where interests are already established, is calling for the truth. We have the third angel's message, the commandments \n\n\n                                   -291- \n\nof God and the faith of Jesus, and this truth is to encircle cities and towns. We are to carry the message from point to point, establishing in each a little community of missionaries. The workers in Australia are directed to enlarge the sphere of their labors by sending help to the unpromising fields in regions beyond, where the standard of truth has never yet been lifted.",
