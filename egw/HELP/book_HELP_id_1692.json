    "word": "Seeds of Truth Can Be Sown in WCTU \n     Only Eternity Will Reveal Accomplishments.--I would not have any of our people so narrow that they should say to Sister Henry, Sever your connection with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Sister Henry can sow the seeds of truth in this society. Not that she needs to give all the knowledge she has obtained on subjects that are objectionable. She can tell the glad tidings of salvation. Then when hearts have become warmed by the Holy Spirit's working, and the walls of prejudice begin to give way, she can present the truth point by point. This work for the WCTU has a wearying and discouraging side, and we should unite in helping our sister. Only eternity will reveal what has been accomplished by this kind of ministry, how many souls, sick with doubt, and tired of worldliness and unrest, have been brought to the Great Physician, who longs to save to the uttermost all who will come unto Him. Christ is a risen Saviour, and there is healing in His wings.--7MR 165 (1899).",
