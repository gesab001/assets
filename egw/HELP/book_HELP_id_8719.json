The reasons you give in favor of building a chapel are sound. Years ago I was shown that such a building would be a great help. Your patrons are mostly those not of our faith, and if anything can be done to interest them in religious things, it will be well. While there have been altogether too many buildings piled up at Battle Creek, which has meant simply robbery of other localities, yet I would not discourage the building of a chapel. A Sanitarium, where people come from all parts of the world, is a missionary field in the highest sense, and a place of worship would be the means of drawing in some souls. I cannot see why the erection of such a building would not be to the honor of God, even though years have passed when it should have been done.",
