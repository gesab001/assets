    "word": "MR No. 766 - Schools Built by D. T. Shireman\n\n     God has been pleased with the work that Brother [D. T.] Shireman has done in arousing an interest in educational work and in erecting church and school buildings in Hildebran [N. C.]. The Lord has accepted his efforts to trade upon his talents. As he has built his plain, unpretentious buildings, heavenly angels have been his helpers. It is this kind of work that makes a good impression on the minds of unbelievers in regard to our brother's abilities. \"Let your light so shine before men,\" the Saviour says, \"that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" --Letter 122, 1902, p. 4. (To J. E. White, June 12, 1902.) Entire letter is published in Spalding-Magan Collection, pp. 223-228. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. February 6, 1980",
