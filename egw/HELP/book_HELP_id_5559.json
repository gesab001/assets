    "word": "6. Ministers to Teach Liberality.--There is a lesson also in this chapter to those who are working in the cause of God. Paul says, \"We desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also\"-- that is, make you to abound in the grace of liberality. A responsibility rests upon the ministers of Christ to educate the churches to be liberal. Even the poor are to have a part in presenting their offerings to God. They are to be sharers of the grace of Christ in denying self to help those whose need is more pressing than their own. Why should the poor saints be denied the blessing of giving to aid those who are still poorer than themselves (MS 28, 1894)?",
