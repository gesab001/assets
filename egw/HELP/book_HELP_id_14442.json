    "word": "Work for Every Member of the Family. \n\n             (Extract from the Northern Union Reaper, Dec. 29, 1908.) \n\n\n     We need to branch out more in our methods of labor; not a hand should be bound; not a soul discouraged; not a voice should be hushed; let every individual labor privately or publicly to help forward the work. Place the burden upon men and women of the church that they may grow by reason of exercise, and thus become efficient agencies in the hand of the Lord for the enlightenment of those who sit in darkness.",
