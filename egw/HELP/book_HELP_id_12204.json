Kellogg.) \n\n     We received your telegram in due time, and we felt grateful for the prospect of $5,000 in about three months' time. This will be a help indeed; for it is very much needed. You speak of Sister McCamly's giving $10,000 for the work of rescuing souls from the lowest depths and securing a home for them in Colorado, and that she is going to raise this sum to $50,000. This is where America has the advantage. There you have those who will make large donations, but we have no such standing. We are yet in the A B C of the work. It makes me sad when I think of all the donations poured into established homes in America, and remember that we have not been able to raise from any source whatever money enough even to make a respectable beginning.",
