    "word": "The Lord has greatly helped me healthwise. Difficulties that I have had for twenty-five years have been removed. I have used no medicine, but for hours during the night season, when I was unable to sleep, I prayed for the healing power of God. I asked the Lord to restore my eyesight, to strengthen my heart, and to relieve the spinal difficulty. I have improved wonderfully. My health is better this winter than it has been for many years. The Great Physician has wrought in my behalf, and I praise His holy name. \n\n                                               -",
