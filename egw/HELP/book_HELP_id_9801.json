    "word": "Here the duty of Christians is clearly defined toward those who need their help because of their straying from God. The erring one is not to be left in his darkness and error; but every available means is to be used to bring him again to the light. The candle is lighted. The word of God is searched for clear points of truth, with earnest prayer for heavenly light to meet the case of the ones enshrouded in darkness and unbelief, that they may be fortified with arguments from the word of God, threatenings, reproofs, and encouragements, that these cases may be reached. Indifference or neglect will meet the frown of God.",
