    "word": "MR No. 1584 - Call to a Higher Standard\n\n     (Diary entry written November 4, 1899, at Rockhampton, Queensland.) \n\n     I thank the Lord for His great mercy and goodness to me. When I look at myself I have not much courage, for I am compassed with infirmities, but I am trusting in a power out of and above myself. I do not doubt but that the Lord will help me. As my day is, so shall my strength be. The Lord is a strong tower, into which the righteous run and are safe. My present state of feebleness makes me feel the necessity of making the Lord my dependence, saying over and over again, In Thee will I trust.",
