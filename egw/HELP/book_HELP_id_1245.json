    "word": "Experienced Helpers \n\n     It is not the wisest course to connect with our sanitariums too many who are inexperienced, who come as learners, while there is a lack of experienced, efficient workers. We need more matronly women, and men who are sound and solid in principle--substantial men who fear God and who can carry responsibilities wisely. Some may come and offer to work for small wages, because they enjoy being at a sanitarium, or because they wish to learn; but it is not true economy to supply an institution largely with inexperienced helpers.",
