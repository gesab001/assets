    "word": "As I looked over this congregation of dear friends, so ardent and cheerful in the truth, and so anxious to catch every ray of additional light, my reflections were indeed solemn. I thought, These have been highly favored in receiving a knowledge of the present truth. They have accepted it in the face of opposition and ridicule, and often at the expense of worldly prosperity. How earnest should they be to help and encourage one another! They are the members of Christ's body, and we are members one of another. The Day-star has risen in their hearts; the rays of the Sun of Righteousness have shone upon their minds. Happy people indeed who are thus highly favored! Truly, \u201cit doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.\u201d",
