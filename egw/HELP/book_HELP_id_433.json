    "word": "Those who reject the life and character of Jesus, refusing to be like Him, declare themselves to be in controversy with God. \u201cHe that is not with me is against me,\u201d Christ declares, \u201cand he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\u201d Those who love God will not choose His enemies as their friends. The question is asked, \u201cShouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them which hate the Lord?\u201d True Christians will not choose the society of non-Christians.",
