    "word": "I never supposed that an institution was to be built by our people exclusively for consumptives. Some with throat and lung trouble would be benefited by treatment, but there are many who would receive no help in such an institution. The fact that such an institution means a constant outlay of money, with no hope of returns, must be considered. If a home for consumptives is to be established, let it be near streams of living water, away from the city, near forests of pine or hemlock, for there are healing properties in them. Then publish the fact that such an institution has been established and call for volunteers to carry on the work. As the Sanitarium in Colorado has been established, let it be appropriated to the use of those who are sick who have some hope of recovery.",
