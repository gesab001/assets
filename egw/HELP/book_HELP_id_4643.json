    "word": "PRAYER NEEDED DAILY TO RESIST SATAN.\u2014Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, or a day. It is a continual growth in grace. We know not one day how strong will be our conflict the next. Satan lives, and is active, and every day we need to cry earnestly to God for help and strength to resist him. As long as Satan reigns we shall have \n159\nself to subdue, besetments to overcome, and there is no stopping place, there is no point to which we can come and say we have fully attained.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, 340.)",
