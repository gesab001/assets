    "word": "These men who in the past gave themselves to God and to the uplifting of his cause were as true as steel to principle. They were men who would not fail nor be discouraged, men who, like Daniel, were full of reverence and zeal for God, men of purpose, industry, and toil. They were as weak and helpless as any of those who are now engaged in the work, but they put their whole dependence in God. They had wealth, but it consisted of mind and soul culture. This every one may have who will make God first, and last, and best in everything. Although destitute of wisdom, knowledge, virtue, and power, we may receive all these if we will learn from Christ the lessons it is our privilege to learn.",
