    "word": "The purging is not pleasant, but let us remember that Christ came to our world and took humanity that He might bear the afflictions that humanity must bear, and be an example of faithful endurance under every form of trial. God wants us to realize that we are a part of the great human family, and that we must bear its tests. My brethren and sisters, let your humanity lay hold of divinity. Go to the footstool of God's grace, and say, \"Lord, I hang my helpless soul on Thee. Help me to control my speech; teach me to overcome.\" Christ will give you a spirit of overcoming.",
