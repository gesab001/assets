Robinson \n\nDear Brother Robinson: \n\n\n     At our request Brother Burden has consented to visit important gatherings of our people in the Middle West, and to endeavor to secure gifts or loans for some of our Southern California Sanitariums. We desire that wherever he goes, he may be given opportunity to present the word and needs of the Paradise Valley Sanitarium and the Loma Linda Sanitarium. We need help in both these places. Both at Loma Linda and at Paradise Valley it has been necessary to build additions to the main building for bathrooms. This has left us with debts that must be met shortly, and we greatly need financial assistance.",
