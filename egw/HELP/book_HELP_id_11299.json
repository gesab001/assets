    "word": "The Lord permits great trials to come upon His loved ones. He tries them as gold. Now is your opportunity to show that you do trust in your Redeemer, even though in the crucible of affliction. Be cheerful. Let your cheerfulness be seen in your countenance, because you have Jesus by your side, to watch with you. You may converse with Jesus. You may say, \"The Lord is my helper. I shall not be moved.\" You may find blessed opportunities to speak to some soul words of courage, and sow seed that will spring up and bear fruit. Let all see in whom you place your trust.",
