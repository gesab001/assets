    "word": "The goods you handle, whatever they may be belong to God. They are to be used where help is needed, that God's work may go forward. He who is working for God is to strengthen the hands of his brethren, as he would like to have his own hands strengthened. But the Spirit of selfishness has been allowed to enter. Many professing Christians have carried out the devices of the enemy, hindering the word of God. The vineyard is barren where today thousands should be rejoicing in the truth. The seeds of truth have not been widely scattered. The work has been bound about, and this has left the vineyard unworked. Facilities have been multiplied in Battle Creek, while in other parts of the field souls are starving for the bread of life. God says, \"Shall I not judge for these things? Men have withheld money, so that My vineyard could not be worked, and as a result I have withheld My goods from them. They have disregarded My word. There should today be 100 laborers where there is but one.\"",
