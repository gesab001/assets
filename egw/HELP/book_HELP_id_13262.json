    "word": "The truth is to be lived out by every one who has any connection with the work of God in our Sanitariums. Physicians, nurses, and helpers are to work in harmony, to heal not merely the maladies of the body, but the disorders of the soul. When this is done, a power from God will go with the workers. Physicians, managers, and nurses will be living channels of light. The Lord will work with the people who will honor Him.",
