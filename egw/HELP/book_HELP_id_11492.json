    "word": "Children, be helpful to your mother. Obey her word promptly, and the Lord will bless you. God said, \"I know Abraham, that he will\"--coax, no;-- \"that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment.\" God expects parents to bring their children up to obey Him. Should your father and mother allow you to do wrong things, without correcting you, they would displease God. Those parents who allow children to have their own way are neglecting their children. Many parents indulge their children, and thus encourage habits that ought to be corrected. Unless these habits are corrected, the children will grow up with unlovely, disagreeable characters. \n\n\n                                   -235-",
