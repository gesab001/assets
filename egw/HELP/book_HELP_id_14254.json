    "word": "You know that I have a deep interest in the school at Berrien Springs. It is the Lord's school, and I will send you his ideas to consider. May he help and strengthen and bless you. Look and live. He will prepare the way before you. Only have faith. God is our helper, our defense. Let us act in accordance with the Scriptures. We are exhorted to be found \"praying always with all prayer and supplication.\" Again we read, \"Be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.\" We are to feel it our privilege to pray, to seek wisdom from God, looking to him for encouragement and spiritual strength. If we were permitted to know one half of the dangers that surround us, we would pray more. \n\n\n                                       (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
