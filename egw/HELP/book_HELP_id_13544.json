    "word": "Let Brother Reaser help you in every possible way, and seek to strengthen him in every right purpose. Tell him the Lord says, \"Be not discouraged; for I am thy God.\" When I think of any other course being taken, I am filled with sorrow. Christ would have us united in Christian fellowship,--a tie more binding than the ties of human kinship. Let us take our stand on a higher platform. Christ has pledged Himself to work for us if we will take hold of Him by faith.",
