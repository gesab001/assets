    "word": "We all need to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. May he help us to plant our feet firmly upon the platform of eternal truth. Give God a chance to impress hearts, brethren, and you will find that a wholesome impression will be left upon the minds both of church members and of outsiders. May God help you to exercise reason in the work of saving souls. Let the people hear through you the voice of God, not the voice of man. Let God's mould be placed upon the work, and not the mould of man. Take to yourselves the exhortation of the apostle Paul to Timothy, \u201cPreach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\u201d \n     Thursday morning, Sept. 17.",
