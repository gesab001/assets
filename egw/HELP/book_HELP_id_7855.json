    "word": "We have each a work to do for the Master. Will we do this work, will we labor with unselfish, self-sacrificing interest to build up His cause, to advance His work? I am determined to do the will of God, to make straight paths for my feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way. There are halting, lame ones enough. . . . God forbid that any of those who have had a knowledge of, and an experience in, the workings of God should themselves be halting, and need to be carried. Let them come up to help; let them become spiritually strong by doing the will of our heavenly Father, and then they can help the halting, lame ones. . . .",
