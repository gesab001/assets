    "word": "I wrote nearly a hundred pages long before my husband died of what would be transacted in the Review & Herald Office. If I can find this matter, I will send it to you. Men are travelling over the very ground that was presented to me years ago. It was made clear to me \n                                                                           1371\nthat light would be rejected, that warnings would be despised, that a spirit of selfishness would be cultivated in the Office, and that men would act from worldly principles, and depart from the law of God. They would give heed to the promptings of the enemy, and would turn human agents away from their right. Religious and business liberty they would labor to control. They would work to have every Seventh Day Adventist institution in subordination to the institution in Battle Creek, and manipulate things so that every branch of the work would be centered and controlled by responsible men in the Review & Herald Office. This is what men are doing, and acting as if every branch of the work, both high and afar off, must come under the jurisdiction of men in Battle Creek, and that every one must circle around their orbit. But the Lord has given light to the effect that our different institutions must stand by themselves. These men are carrying on their counsels, and acting as though God in person had spoken by them. They bear themselves loftily toward the purchase of Christ's blood. They act as though every individual must acknowledge their sway, and use his ability and talent as they may direct. If he will not come under their control they crush him out or treat him with indifference. They consider it is an abomination to be unsubmissive, and those who do not submit to their jurisdiction are left without sympathy, without help or support. They say by their spirit and action, \"If he dies, let him die.\"",
