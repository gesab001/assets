    "word": "Bro. Saxby came to that Office a good boy; but he was not experienced. He needed help, the very help those in the Office could give him. He was a student, fresh from school, and needed to learn many things. He had started out on a wrong plan. If he had worked his way along, earning his money by his own labor, to obtain an education, he would have obtained the very experience he needed. Now he is deficient in essential branches of education, without the knowledge of which he cannot make life a success. If those in the Office had given the inexperienced youth sympathy, instead of making sport over his high and lofty ideas, it would have been more pleasing to God.",
