    "word": "MR No. 1512 - Christ Our Helper; Seek for Unity\n\n     (Written May 8, 1903, from \"Elmshaven,\" Sanitarium, California, to the Doctors Kress.) \n\n\n     I have read the letters that came to me from you in the last mail from Australia. I will try to write you a few lines in reply. My left eye must be kept bandaged, because of its weakness and pain, and I cannot read your letters over again, so you must excuse me if I do not speak of all the points you mentioned.",
