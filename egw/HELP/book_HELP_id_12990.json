    "word": "I had hoped when you left this meeting you would be in an entirely different spirit than that which you brought to it. I bore my testimony in regard to things which transpired in Minneapolis. This I did because it was urged upon me by the Spirit of the Lord. But what influence did the words and reading of the manuscript have upon your mind? What effect did it have?--- Not that which it should have had, by any means.

I presented the state of \n                                                                           585\nthings as God had presented them to me. I illustrated the positions we should occupy as they had been presented to me. I had no personal feelings in the remark made to you that morning. In the line of my work I speak the things the Lord gives me. And in my words to you I would no more dare to say that the Lord did not move me to make the remarks which I made in that talk all the way through. It is not in me to wish to hurt the feelings of my brethren---not the least of the greatest. I had a word for you, and I wanted you to explain the demonstrations that you made. I asked you to do so, and when you explained that it was because you appreciated the remarks, the Spirit of God brought that answer to my lips. You needed those words or they would not have been spoken. From the lines you have traced to me, I am thoroughly convinced that you needed those words.",
