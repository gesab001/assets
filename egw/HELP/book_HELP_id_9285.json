    "word": "Thus will the physicians of the Health Institute have their labor and efforts treated. But if, in their labor to help suffering humanity, one out of twenty makes a right use of the benefits received, and appreciates the efforts in his behalf, the physicians should feel satisfied and grateful. If one life is saved \n                                                                           40\nin ten, and one soul saved in the kingdom of God in one hundred, all connected with the Institute will be amply repaid for all their efforts. All their anxiety and care are not wholly lost. If the King of glory, the Majesty of Heaven, worked for suffering humanity, and so few appreciated his divine aid, the physicians and helpers at the Institute should blush to complain if their feeble efforts are not appreciated by all, and seem to be thrown away on some.",
