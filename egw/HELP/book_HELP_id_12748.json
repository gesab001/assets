    "word": "God wants us to cooperate with Him. When we cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh, perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord, we shall be as happy a people as has ever been seen. The salvation of God will be revealed. To the patients I would say, Take hold earnestly, and unite your efforts with the efforts of those who are trying to help you. Believe that all heaven is desirous of your being in health, soul, body, and spirit. Believe that the heavenly angels are round about you, watching to do you good, for it is even so.",
