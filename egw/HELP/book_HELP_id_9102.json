    "word": "Laymen Needed in New Fields \n\n     I wish there were men and women who could appreciate the situation, and would decide to move to these countries, Australia and New Zealand. Helpers are needed who have some means, who can engage in some employment and sustain themselves and not draw upon the Conference for their support. With genuine faith in the message of truth, such workers could settle in our cities as missionaries, letting their light shine forth to others. \n                                                                           21",
