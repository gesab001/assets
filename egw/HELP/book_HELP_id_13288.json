    "word": "The work of preparing a people to know God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent is to go forward. This is the highest and most important work that it is possible for mortals to do. God desires medical missionary work to be represented in a way altogether different from the way in which it has been represented in Chicago. The work in Chicago has been a great hindrance to the harmonious action of the work God designed, giving the first, second, and third angels messages to all parts of our world. The work in Australia is not to be a second edition of the work done in Chicago. My heart is sore and grieved because the money which God designed to flow in currents of gifts and offerings to Australia, England, and other missionary fields has been obstructed by human devising and human planning. This must not be repeated in this country or in any other country; for it is not God's way to leave fields nigh and afar off without help. Thus the work of the gospel ministry is retarded. The last message of mercy is to be given to the world, to prepare a people for the second coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in power and great glory.",
