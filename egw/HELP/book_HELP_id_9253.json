    "word": "In such an institution as the Sanitarium, where many are laboring together, some will do what they would not think it honest to do were they separately employed. They would have more respect for their reputation than to be found faulty in any of the so-called little matters. A person employed in a private family would not dare to take such liberties with his employer's property as are taken at the Sanitarium. The helpers influence one another to do unlawful acts; and they do not realize that they are, through indulgence of self, wronging one of God's instrumentalities, and crippling its powers. The fact that several are doing the same thing does not lessen their guilt. It is the act itself that is wrong, whether performed by many or by few.",
