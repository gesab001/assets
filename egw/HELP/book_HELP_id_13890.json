Simpson to leave Southern California to labor elsewhere. If Elder Simpson feels it his duty to go, I have nothing to say against it. But I had hoped to see him extend his work from Los Angeles to Redlands and Riverside. The condition of Brother Simpson's health is such that great care must be exercised in regard to the location of his field of labor. He should have suitable help, that he may be relieved from the burden of speaking so frequently. Would it not be well if Elder Corliss and Elder Simpson could labor together?",
