    "word": "[Early in August, 1878,] we stopped in Boulder City [Colorado], and beheld with joy our canvas meetinghouse, where Elder Cornell was holding a series of meetings. . . . The tent had been lent to hold temperance meetings in, and, by special invitation, I spoke to a tent full of attentive hearers. Though wearied by my journey, the Lord helped me to successfully present before the people the necessity of practicing strict temperance in all things.--Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 290-297.",
