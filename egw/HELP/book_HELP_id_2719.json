    "word": "The intense darkness of the day was succeeded, an hour or two before evening, by a partially clear sky, and the sun appeared, though it was still obscured by the black, heavy mist. But \u201cthis interval was followed by a return of the obscuration with greater density, that rendered the first half of the night hideously dark beyond all former experience of the probable million of people who saw it. From soon after sunset until midnight, no ray of light from moon or star penetrated the vault above. It was pronounced \u2018the blackness of darkness!\u2019\u201d Said an eye-witness of the scene: \u201cI could not help conceiving, at the time, that if every luminous body in the universe had been shrouded in impenetrable darkness, or struck out of existence, the darkness could not have been more complete.\u201d Though the moon that night rose to the full, \u201cit had not the least effect to dispel the death-like shadows.\u201d After midnight the darkness disappeared, and the moon, when first visible, had the appearance of blood.",
