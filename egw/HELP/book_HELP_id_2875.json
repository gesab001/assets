    "word": "This was the case last Sabbath, and it has been my experience over and over again. Why is this? God honors my faith. I plead his promises, and he helps me. I have felt sometimes that I should fall in death while speaking, and perhaps this is the way I shall go. However this may be, I want to die at my post. I am not going to talk doubt and unbelief; neither will I dwell upon my infirmities. I will talk of Jesus and his power to save. It is \u201cnot by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d",
