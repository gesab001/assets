    "word": "Order Life by the Inspired Word--I dare not give my opinion of duties for others unless I have the words of counsel from God. As I read the blessed, Holy Bible I can speak words from the Book of books and from instruction the Lord has given me to give to those who ask me to help them when they are in difficulty. But I always encourage them by the Word itself, and urge them to take everything to God in prayer, pleading the promise, \"Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find.\"",
