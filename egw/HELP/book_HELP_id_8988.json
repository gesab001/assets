    "word": "SpTB13 - The New England Sanitarium (1908)\n\n\n               Removal to Melrose \n\n     The Lord in His providence has opened the way for His workers to take an advance step in New England,--a field where much special work should be done. The brethren there have been enabled to arrange to change the location of the sanitarium from South Lancaster to Melrose, a place much nearer Boston, and yet far enough removed from the busy city so that the patients may have the most favorable conditions for recovery of health. The transfer of the New England Sanitarium to a place so convenient to the city of Boston, is in God's providence. When the Lord sets His hand to prepare the way before us, God forbid that any should stand back, questioning the wisdom of going forward, or refusing to give encouragement and help.",
