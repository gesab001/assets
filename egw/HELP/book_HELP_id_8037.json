    "word": "When we are surrounded by influences calculated to lead us away from God, our petitions for help and strength must be unwearied. Unless this is so, we shall never be successful in breaking down pride and overcoming the power of temptation to sinful indulgences which keep us from the Savior. The light of truth, sanctifying the life, will discover to the receiver the sinful passions of the heart which are striving for the mastery, and which make it necessary . . . to stretch every nerve and exert all the powers to resist Satan that he or she may conquer through the merits of Christ.\u2014Messages to Young People, pp. 247, 248.",
