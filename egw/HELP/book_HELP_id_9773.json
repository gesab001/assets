    "word": "If Brn. A., O., and L., had rightly appreciated the sin which drove us from R., had they fully received the light God had given them, and taken his warnings to heart, nothing could have induced them to settle in R., the place from which we were driven by neglect, unbelief, and rejection of the message God had given us for them. In feebleness and discouragement we toiled on under difficulties. But for the help of God we would have lost hope and gone into the grave. Had those families not returned to R., they would not have been broken up as they have been, and the fearful calamities which have filled hearts with grief and inexpressible sadness, would not have occurred.",
