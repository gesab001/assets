    "word": "I can assure you that the large number of patients at the Sanitarium is no evidence that the institution is where it should be, or that it is conducted after God's order. Christ's plan for teaching truth can not be carried out in so large an institution as the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where so large a number of patients of all classes are gathered together. There may be some conversions at the Sanitarium at Battle Creek, among those who go there for treatment, but these will meet with greater difficulty than in almost any other place. Because of the large number of patients, this sanitarium is necessarily conducted as a large hotel. Worldlings of all classes are of course entertained there, and the helpers are constantly brought into connection with an influence that tends to draw them away from Christ. Oh, why can not those who know the \n\n\n                               -307- \n\ntruth follow the instruction that God has given? Why do they not make plants in places that have never yet heard the truth? Let us pray to God for help to do His work as in his very presence.",
