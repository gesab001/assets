    "word": "Why, I am wonderfully glad when I find that somebody is different from me, because they are going to help me, or I them, one or the other; and whatever they are, I feel as if we can cement. That is what they want here-they want the cementing power of God upon them, and they want to work as for time and for eternity. I want to cry it out as I have heard it cried out, \u201cLift up your voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d We have to get our sins out of the way before we can expect God to come in here and bring us in a position where we can glorify His name. We have to be where the glory of God can come right through us, where the Holy Spirit of God can come upon us, and it can be reflected right upon others.",
