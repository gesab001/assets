    "word": "Experienced Workers Needed \n\n     It is not the wisest course to connect with our sanitariums too many who are inexperienced, who come as learners, while there is a lack of experienced, efficient workers. We need more matronly women, and men who are sound and solid in principle --substantial men who fear God and who can carry responsibilities \n                                                                           174\nwisely.
