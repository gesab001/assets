    "word": "\"Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty\" (Judges 5:23). Let the indifferent ones arouse and do their part in the work of the Lord, lest this curse be spoken against them. Let all who can, give themselves to the long-neglected work in our cities, a work that has been looked at, and then passed by on the other side, as the wounded man was passed by by the priest and Levite. Take up the work in the cities wholeheartedly, intelligently, unselfishly.",
