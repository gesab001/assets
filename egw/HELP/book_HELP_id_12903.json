    "word": "Brother and Sister Butler, I know that your discernment is not clear. Do not then move hastily, if you do you will always regret it. You will be subject to strong temptations. It is always thus. You know how it has been in your experience with others, and you know how the enemy would lead the minds that are tempted to interpret everything in a wrong light. In the place of their trying to see their own hearts and set them in order, they will question and try and see if they cannot find some flaw in the Testimonies, and you have not one by your side who will help you into confidence, but one who will suggest many things to strengthen doubt and unbelief. \n                                                                           194",
