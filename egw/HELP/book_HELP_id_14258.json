    "word": "Now, my brother, I am deeply sorry for you and your family. I reproach thee not for thy zeal, for if others had shared the burdens as they should have done, the work would have been far advanced, but not, just now, you must come apart and rest awhile. Be not concerned in regard to your wages. God will not leave you without some help and comfort for yourself, your wife, and little ones. Be of good courage in the Lord. Trust Him fully. Let the Lord carry the burden of the school. You are not to become loaded down with burdens that will accomplish only the work that finite man can do. When you put your trust wholly in God, then you will see in every passage of your experience One going before you preparing the way.",
