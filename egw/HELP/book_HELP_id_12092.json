    "word": "I shall not attend the camp meetings in the East. I do not consider this in any sense to be my duty. Should I attend these meetings we should no sooner get settled here than we should have to break up and scatter again. If the Lord said, \"Go,\" I would not hesitate a moment. But I have to regard my writings in a different light from that which I have done in the past, in relation to traveling and speaking. My duty is to get out my books, and those who help me must be carefully selected. My work demands the very best workers, workers who will not cause me any anxiety. You can get workers more easily than I, though they might not suit you quite as well as some you might choose.",
