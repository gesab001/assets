    "word": "I have been instructed to warn our people no longer to accuse others, but to rid their hearts of all selfishness, that in their lives Christ may be revealed. They are to show an appreciation for one another, esteeming others better than themselves. Then they will be prepared to help and strengthen one another, speaking words of hope and cheer, making hearts glad instead of sorrowful.",
