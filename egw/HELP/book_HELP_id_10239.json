    "word": "I attended the meeting in the chapel and spoke in the meeting for the ministerial students. We had an excellent meeting. There was a very tender spirit. Many are drawing nigh to God and coming to the light, and the Lord is helping them to clear away the rubbish from the door of their hearts and let Jesus come in. There is now a change in the expression of their countenances. Light from the Lord has been reflected upon their hearts and shines forth in their countenances.--Ms 40, 1891, pp. 3, 4, 7-9, 11, 20, 23. (Diary, Jan. 1891. Begins Jan. 1, 1891.)",
