    "word": "B 17. '05 (Copied Jan. 11, '05):-- \n\nIn our Washington work, wise, competent physicians, efficient managers, and nurses with the very best qualifications will be needed. Earnest, devoted young people also will be needed, to enter the work as nurses. These young men and women will increase in capability as they use conscientiously the knowledge they gain, and they will become better and better qualified to be the Lord's helping hand. They may become successful missionaries, pointing souls to the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world, and whose healing efficiency can save both soul and body.",
