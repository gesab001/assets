    "word": "The Lord would have kept the Sanitarium pure and true, to represent the truth for these last days. But the very ones who should have helped you do this work, you have despised, and turned from as unworthy of your notice. God sees that His work is being lowered into the slums, as Satan wants it to be; that the elevated sanctification of the truth will become so mingled with tares that its peculiar, holy character will sink out of sight. The Lord saw how this would be, and He sent you warnings. Yet your study is to go right on in your own way, and pick flaws in the message, just as others have done before you. I dare not trust the messages in your hands. You read that portion which sustains you, but the portions which warn and caution and give the note of alarm, you do not bring before those who should hear them.",
