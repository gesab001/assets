    "word": "It often occurs that when one burdened with a heavy load is at the foot of a difficult hill, surrounded by discouragements, and in need of cheerful, strong helpers to work with him in pulling up the heavy load, much time is wasted in criticism and scolding and fretting. But this does not help the situation; it does not move the load. The ones upon whom the pressure of the load rests most heavily do not need nor deserve the censure. This might fall more appropriately upon those who should have shared the burden earlier. But even then censure might be inappropriate, and it certainly would be useless. Our first thought should be. How can we unite in helping to lift the load? Time is precious. There is too much at stake to run the risk of delay.",
