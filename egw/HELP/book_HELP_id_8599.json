    "word": "Bro. C. has that in him that will not allow him, if he has health, to depend on anyone. But the man who purchased his boat has paid him nothing, for he could not. W. C. White saw Bro.

About twelve acres have been declared and planted with sweet corn and field corn. The sweet corn they will eat, and the field corn they will sell.

They are so earnest and full of zeal that it is amusing to look at them and see how happy they are in their work. They have not much society besides their own family connections, but they are in the very best school they could be in.--Letter 48, 1899.",
