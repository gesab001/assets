    "word": "Difficulties will arise. You will meet with obstacles. Look constantly to Jesus. When an emergency arises, ask, \u201cLord, what shall I do now?\u201d If you refuse to storm or fret or scold, the Lord will show you the way through. He will help you to use the talent of speech in such a Christlike way that the precious attributes of patience, comfort, and love will be brought into the home. . . .",
