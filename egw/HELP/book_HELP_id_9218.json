    "word": "What style of dress can be neater, more modest, and more becoming girls from the ages of five to fourteen years than ours? Stand those girls of fashion beside these, and then say which appears the more comfortable, more modest, and more becoming. The fashionable style is not as long as ours; yet no one laughs at those who follow that style, for wearing a short dress. Their limbs are nearly naked, while modesty and health clothe the limbs of the others. Fashion and false modesty look upon these girls who have their limbs clad in reference to comfort, modesty, and health, with horror, but smile upon those whose dresses are quite as short, and whose limbs are uncomfortably, immodestly, and unhealthfully exposed. Here come the cross and the reproach, for simply doing right, in the face of the tyrant--Fashion. God help us to have the moral courage to do right, and to labor patiently and humbly in the great cause of reform.",
