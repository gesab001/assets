    "word": "\"He shall glorify me.\" \"This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.\" The Holy Spirit glorifies God by so revealing his character to his people that he becomes the object of their supreme affections, and by making manifest his character in them. They see clearly that there was never any righteousness in the world but his, no excellence in the world but that derived from him. When the Spirit was poured out from on high, the church was flooded with light, but Christ was the source of that light; his name was on every tongue, his love filled every heart. So it will be when the angel that comes down from heaven having great power, shall lighten the whole earth with his glory. May the Lord help his people to see and understand what is truth.",
