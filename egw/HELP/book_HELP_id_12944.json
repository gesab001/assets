    "word": "Bro. Fargo would have been a wise counselor to Elder Van Horn had he not had the unfortunate experience that he did at Minneapolis. His understanding has been perverted since that meeting. Bro. Howard Miller, in his present condition, will be a hindrance in any meeting of counsel. He will keep silent, or if he speaks, he will frequently speak to discourage those who lay plans before him for his consideration. Time and again, methods wisely devised have been set before him, and, because he did not originate them himself he disapproved of them, and they have been given up, when they should have been carried out. It was most unfortunate that he was connected with Br. Van Horn, for he has not helped him as he ought to have done.\n                                                                           392\nHe should not think that his main business in his official capacity is to raise objections and block the wheels. Eld. Van Horn needs no such hindrance. He needs men who will lift and push, and supply his deficiencies unselfishly. If these Brn. Miller think their course is wise, they are greatly deceived. They must have a transformation of character in order to be useful men in the cause of God, that they may be able to receive the overcomer's reward hereafter.",
