    "word": "Christ is willing to help all who feel their need of help; but if any are satisfied with themselves, the Saviour will pass them by. Flavel has said: \u201cWhen the Lord intends to fill a soul, he first makes it empty; when he intends to enrich a soul, he first makes it poor; when he intends to exalt a soul, he first makes it sensible of its own miseries, want, and nothingness.\u201d I desired our brethren to have a sense of their wasted or unimproved opportunities, to realize that they were dwarfs in the religious life, when they might be giants.",
