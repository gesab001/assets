    "word": "There is a Place for Everybody in the Work \n\n\n     We each have a work to do for God, whatever may be our occupation. Those who are on their farms, are not to think that it would be a waste of time for them to plan to go out and visit their neighbors, and hold up before them the light of the truth for this time; for even if it does seem difficult to leave the farm work, yet we shall not lose financially because of spending time in helping others. \n\n\n                    -13- \n\nThere is a God in heaven that will bless our labors. To every man--and to every woman --he has given his work. We may co-operate with Christ, by showing to others what it means to seek for eternal life as for hidden treasure. God has called upon us to do this kind of work--to look after the poor, the needy, the suffering; to be awake to the necessities of those in need of spiritual refreshment; to be ever ready to open the Scriptures to hungering souls.",
