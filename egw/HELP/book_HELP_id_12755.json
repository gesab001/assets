    "word": "[Sister White then offered prayer as follows:] \n\n\n     Our heavenly Father, we come to Thee at this time just as we are, needy and dependent, but we know, Lord, that Thou art a compassionate Saviour. Thou hast made an infinite sacrifice, that we may have eternal life, if we will only cooperate with Thee. We ask Thee to put it into our hearts today, to renew our covenant with Thee by sacrifice. Help us this day that we may lay hold upon Thee by living faith. Separate from us everything that would separate us from Thee.",
