    "word": "What an account will those in _____ have to give who have the Bible to guide them as to the spirit and action they must have in order to lead souls out of darkness to the path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in. How much money is expended in order to follow the promptings and desires of a carnal heart, to please and glorify self. How much means might flow into the Lord's treasury that is employed upon self. And in the judgment those poor tempted souls who have lived to please themselves will see these things as God has estimated them. They will see how they might have saved and helped, if they had not been so absorbed with self. Everyone who has a knowledge of the truth has a work to do to come into sympathy with Christ. \"Ye are laborers together with God.\" The salvation of the soul is above every other interest. How much higher than every other enterprise is measured by the cross of Calvary. . . .",
