    "word": "We find it difficult to bring out all the books that we desire to, for we have not the means to pay for the work that \n\n210 \n\nmust be done on them. But the Lord knows all about this, and He may move upon the heart of someone who can do so to help us in this time of need. It is hard to be delayed in this work, for we know that we have but a short time to labor, and we greatly desire to give the world the light we have received from the Lord. We shall do what we can in the preparation of the matter, and will ask the Lord to lay the burden upon those who can help us with their talent of means. Some have already lent me money. Upon this money I pay them 5 percent interest, and whenever they call for the return of the money, I send it to them.",
