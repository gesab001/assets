    "word": "When the Son of man comes from heaven with all His glory, He will then reward every man according to his works. Here we are appointed to the future life. We have a heaven to gain and a hell to shun. Paul says, \"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.\" [1 Corinthians 15:19.] We want to think of the future home, where there is no disappointment, no sin, no enemy, no outburst of passion. And all of this will be realized by those who will follow the true Shepherd and obey the commandments of God. Although Satan is at war with the followers of Christ, the true Shepherd will not allow anyone to pluck them out of His hand. Every soul that comes in sincerity will find help. Our heavenly Father tells us to ask, and if we ask we shall receive. He knows that we are deformed by sin. He knows our weakness. He knows that Satan is striving to control the passions of men; and He has sent Christ to break every yoke, to set before man an example, and it is for us to copy the perfect Pattern, for heaven is worth everything.",
