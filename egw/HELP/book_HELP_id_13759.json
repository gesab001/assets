    "word": "All, whether entrusted with a few or with many talents, are to blend together in unity. We need more of the spirit of the Saviour that we may help those who have been restricted and hindered. How much we may help them in their efforts to rise will never be known till it is made manifest in the judgment. We should have a word of encouragement to speak to all, remembering that there are a diversity of gifts. Some who desire to fill a large place and do some great service, overlook the little things that must be done by somebody, and forget that those who do these things need encouragement. \n\n\n                                                                         13.",
