    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 17, 1892. I thank the Lord that the long, painful night has passed. Today I am suffering more than usual. I am almost helpless with weakness and pain, yet I am trusting in my Helper. He never fails me. He makes me feel young in heart, cheerful in spirit, and thankful, so thankful, for His grace. I have much pain, but I have peace and comfort also.",
