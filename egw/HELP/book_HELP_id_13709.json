    "word": "Educate for the Master \n\n     The family should be a school where the father and mother, under the control of Christ, seek to educate their children for the Master. They should not try to evade the responsibilities of this work. They should not give their time to visiting, to the entertainment of visitors, neglecting their children to do this. If parents neglect to teach their children to be useful and helpful, Satan takes them and instructs them in his school, and those who learn in this school show who has been their instructor.",
