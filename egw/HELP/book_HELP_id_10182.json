    "word": "Children, be helpful to your mother. Obey her word promptly, and the Lord will bless you. God said, \"I know Abraham, that he will\"--coax?--no;--\"that he will command his children and his household after him, and they \n\n\n                                       -48- \n\nwill keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment.\" Should your father and mother allow you to do wrong things, without correcting you, they would displease God. God wants you, Henry and Herbert, to behave like little gentlemen. When you speak kind words and do right deeds, you are forming characters that God can approve. He will be pleased to call you the lambs of His flock, and He will bless you.",
