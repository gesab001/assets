    "word": "The words of every worker connected with the Paradise Valley Sanitarium should be such that the Spirit of God can impress them upon human minds; their works such that the light of heaven will be reflected in their efforts. Then when these workers go to other institutions, whether for service or only for a visit, they will be ready to speak helpful words to those whom they meet. Constantly they will bring into their speech the strengthening power of the Holy Spirit, and, working on the plan of addition, will add to faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge temperance, to temperance patience, to patience godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity. \"If these things be in you and abound,\" the apostle declares, \"they make you that ye shall be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"",
