    "word": "Sister Kellogg came for me yesterday and took baby and me home with her and we spent the day; had a good visit. Last night I rested, yet my back is weak and I am so lame I cannot get around much. I went upstairs once on my knees to get these things together for the poor. Czechowski is quite poor and we shall send a box to them in about four weeks. Mr. Warren's little girl is dead; died with croup very suddenly. They had no little chemise to lay her out in; got one of Mary Loughborough. The family, we find, are destitute of almost everything. They must have help or suffer this winter. Dr. King is near his end; can live but a few weeks.",
