    "word": "The experience of Paul and Barnabas is recorded for the instruction of the churches today. \"Arise, shine,\" the Lord commands, \"for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee\" (Isaiah 60:1). The Holy Spirit was given to these disciples who were especially set apart, and the same presence will go with every one who will be a laborer together with God, seeking His counsel, and surrendering the will to His will. The Holy Spirit--this is the sacred endowment of those who humble their hearts before God, and submit to His guidance; this is the secret of their power. Much prayer, and a humbling of the heart, a constant surrender of the will to God, will bring the help pledged to every worker by the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Angels of God will work for those who yield themselves to the leading of the Spirit.",
