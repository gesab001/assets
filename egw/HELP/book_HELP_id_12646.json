    "word": "\"Those who confess Me in this wicked and adulterous generation, him will I confess before My Father and the holy angels.\" This means that in your conduct, in your thoughts and faculties, and character, and every- thing, that you deport yourselves as Christians. You crucify Him afresh by your disloyal conduct. It is time that we were purifying ourselves as He is pure. Our human nature is to be as pure in our sphere as God is in His divine sphere. It is to be without spot. He sent His Son to sanctify and take us to Himself, and in that gift He sent down all heaven to honor us with eternal life. What a gift is this! May God help us to come up to the mark of the high calling which is in Christ Jesus.",
