    "word": "I beseech those who have received the light of truth to do all in their power to carry out the commission given by Christ to His disciples. Let ministers understand that they are to impart that which they receive. Let them remember that their success comes from God, who is always ready to give a fresh supply of grace to the humble and contrite ones. Let them live in the light and love of God, improving the opportunities presented to them, and drawing into the web threads which will help to make the perfect pattern. Each human being is weaving his own web, and each throw of the shuttle helps to decide his own soul's destiny and the souls of others by his consistent, godly life.",
