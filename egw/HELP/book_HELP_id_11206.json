    "word": "When you rise up, and when you sit down, when you go out, and when you come in, you need to exercise Christian politeness and respect, because you are the purchase of the blood of Christ, and He has died upon Calvary's cross that we might live.

Recollect what their privileges are, and don't talk of the difficulties, but go right to them and try to bind up the brokenhearted. These are right in the church all around us. Never have an idea that you know more than your brethren, but just keep humble. It was this spirit of evil surmising that brought all the weakness into the Jewish nation.--Ms. 4, 1889, pp. 1, 2. (\"Preparation for Christ's Coming,\" May 14, 1889.)",
