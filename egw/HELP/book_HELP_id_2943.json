    "word": "God does not accept men because of their capabilities, but because they seek His face, desiring His help. God sees not as man sees. He judges not from appearances. He searches the heart, and judges righteously. \"To this man will I look,\" He declares, \"even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.\" He accepts and communes with His lowly, unpretentious followers; for in them He sees the most precious material, which will stand the test of storm and tempest, heat and pressure.",
