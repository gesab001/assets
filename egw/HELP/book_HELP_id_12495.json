    "word": "I have an appointment for tonight. Sunday we had a little shower but it was all clear in the evening. All the help I have here is Elder Washburn. This \n\n\n                                    -51- \n\nwill throw considerable labor upon me, but I shall try to be careful. I had a malarious attack but not serious. I am feeling quite strong and of good courage in the Lord. I tried to have them release me two evenings this week to speak twice in Baltimore, but they are unwilling I shall go, so I am in for it over next Sabbath and Sunday. . . .",
