    "word": "Be sure that God has not laid upon those who remain away from these foreign fields of labor the burden of criticizing the ones who are on the ground where the work is being done. You need not be so zealous to get into the hands of worldly men God's own money of which they have been robbing Him all their lives. Those who are not on the ground know nothing about the necessities of the situation, and if they cannot say anything to help those who are on the ground, let them not hinder but stand out of the way and give the Lord a chance to work with people. Let them show their wisdom by the eloquence of silence, and attend to their work that is close at their hand. I protest against the zeal that they manifest that is not according to knowledge when they ventilate their ideas about foreign fields of labor. When they shall be sent to their foreign fields it will then be time for them to attend to the work God has assigned them.",
