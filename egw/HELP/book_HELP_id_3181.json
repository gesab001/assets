    "word": "\u201cI saw that God could rain means from Heaven to carry on his work, but he never will do this; it is contrary to his plan. He has entrusted men on \n336\nearth with sufficient means to carry forward his work, and if all do their duty, there will be no lack. But some will not heed the call for their means. They are willing to see the work of God go forward; they are anxious to see the cause prosper; provided they can keep their riches and make no sacrifice, only to bestow a trifle now and then, which should cause them shame for its being so little and so grudgingly bestowed. Said the angel, \u2018God loveth a cheerful giver.\u2019 Individuals who have means are convinced of the truthfulness of our position. They embrace it. They are tested. Opportunities are presented for them to help the cause of God with the unrighteous mammon (this world's riches), and make friends, that when they shall fail here they may be received into everlasting habitations.",
