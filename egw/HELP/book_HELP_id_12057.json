    "word": "It is not safe for one of your family to tamper with temptation on the wine cup. They are only safe in seeking that help which God alone can give. Let not one son by his words and his example become Satan's agent to tempt one of the family to lead to indulge and awaken the demon appetite, which spoiled the life of the father and sent him prematurely to the grave. The children have had these traits transmitted to them from the father. Satan exercises his utmost powers to surround the youth with every temptation which leads to evil ways.--Letter 1, 1893. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. January 22, 1989. Entire Letter.",
