    "word": "When a limb is broken, physicians recommend their patients not to eat meat, as there would be danger of inflammation setting in. Condiments and spices used in the preparation of food for the table, and in the digestion (cause indigestion?) in the same way that tea, coffee, and liquor are supposed to help a laboring man to prepare his tasks. After the immediate effects are gone, they drop as low correspondingly below par as they were elevated above par by those stimulating influences. The system is weakened, the blood is contaminated, and inflammation is the sure result.",
