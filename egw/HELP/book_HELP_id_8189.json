    "word": "Satanic agencies are ever warring for the mastery over human minds. But the angels of God are constantly at work, strengthening the weak hands and confirming the feeble knees of all who call upon God for help. The promise to every child of God is, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\" (Matthew 7:7). The Lord is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than parents are to give good gifts to their children. Then ask; believe what God has said. He will surely fulfill His word. Say from the heart, \"My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever\" (Psalm 73:26). The victory must be gained day by day. As followers of Christ we are to stand on vantage ground before the world as Christ's representatives. Let us then engage in this part of the Christian warfare, determinedly overcoming every weakness of character. . . .",
