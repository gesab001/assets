    "word": "Let us study also the 33rd Psalm; it contains precious instruction for those who wish to understand the way of the Lord. In this instruction men are encouraged to proclaim to their fellow men the exalted privilege of expressing the divine image in thought and deed. There is no encouragement for self to manifest itself in large proportions; but encouragement is given that the Lord will impress and refine and purify the heart and mind and life. \"Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His mercy; to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waiteth for the Lord: He is our help and our shield. For our heart shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted in His holy name. Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we hope in Thee\" [Verses 18-22].",
