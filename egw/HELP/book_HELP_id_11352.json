    "word": "Now a few words on another subject. My brother, you need not afflict your soul with regard to your future work. Hide self in Christ. Do not worry. The storm will come but Christ is at the helm. The ship is not left to the guidance of inexperienced hands. Your help will be needed in the work of reconstruction to be done in the future. I pray that you may be weighted with the Holy Spirit. [Hebrews 10:23-25, quoted.]",
