    "word": "Are we prepared for the solemn investigation of our works? Will the Master look upon your work and say, \"Well done good and faithful servant?\" Do the work of today with fidelity. Take up the burdens in your path. Do cheerfully the duties that are before you to do today. And the Lord will help you in the effort. You are too willing to bend to the right and left. Obey the apostle's injunction. \"Owe no man anything.\" Make this a point in your future life.",
