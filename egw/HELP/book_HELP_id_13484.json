    "word": "(354) W.-164-'07                National City, California, Elder J. E. White,              May 7, 1907. \n\nDear Son Edson:-- \n\n\n     . . . \n     In many places I see a great need for the investment of means in the cause of God. Next week I expect to return to Loma Linda, and while there I will do what I can to help forward the work in the surrounding cities. I desire to invest some means in the work in these places. I hope to find opportunity to speak to our people in that locality, and to arouse them to a sense of their responsibility to hold up the light of truth. If, before I leave Loma Linda, I can see the right work begun, I shall not then feel pressed as a cart beneath sheaves, after I return home.",
