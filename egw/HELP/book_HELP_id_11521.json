Will you get a small box and put in it small pink roots and slips, a few choice rose cuttings, fuchsia, and geraniums; and send also at the same time, if thought best, some on or two or more of my scrapbooks that contain pieces especially treating on the mother's duty and influence in her family. I would like that little blue-covered book for youth and any other books that would help me in the work we design to get out, Mother's Influence. We want these things as soon as they can reach us.--Letter 3b, 1881, p. 3. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. April 11, 1985",
