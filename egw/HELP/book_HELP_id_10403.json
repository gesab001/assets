    "word": "All human effort combined is weakness without the deep moving of the Spirit of God. . . . Without His help the deep learning and restless energy of a Paul, the eloquence and talent of an Apollos, will fall infinitely short of convicting and bringing one soul to repentance. . . . While man can do nothing without God, the Lord would do nothing without the human channel.--Letter 85, 1898.",
