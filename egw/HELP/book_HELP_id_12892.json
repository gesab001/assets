    "word": "I have seen ladies in England who would be riding in their carriages with their little dogs in their arms and the little blanket to put over them, and the houses that were built, beautiful and expensive. You ask what these houses are for, and the answer is, \"For the hounds and dogs.\" But you can see the little children and women, miserable and poor, in the streets, destitute of clothing. Now, what sense is there in that? Do you think that work will be as far reaching as eternity? We do not want to misuse any of God's creatures, but we want to give our first attention to those souls for whom Christ died, and we do not want to devote our means in such foolish channels. We do not want our means to flow out for our own selfish interests; but we want to use it in gaining that experience that will help us to advance the missionary work; and in doing \n                                                                           148\nthis we are laying up a treasure in heaven. God Himself will connect with every self-sacrificing work and effort that shall be made to educate and train ourselves for labor, and will put His seal and mold on it. It may look to us very feeble, and we may never understand the results of our labor, but God knows all about it, and we sow beside all waters, not knowing which will prosper, this or that.",
