    "word": "The Call to Enlist \n\n     Christ is calling for volunteers to enlist under His standard, and bear the banner of the cross \n                                                                           25\nbefore the world. The church is languishing for the help of young men who will bear a courageous testimony, who will with their ardent zeal stir up the sluggish energies of God's people, and so increase the power of the church in the world. Young men are wanted who will resist the tide of worldliness, and lift a voice of warning against taking the first steps in immorality and vice.",
