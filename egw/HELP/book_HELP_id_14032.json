    "word": "Be kind in all you do and say. If anyone speaks harsh, irritating words to you, do not retaliate. Speak gently, and thus help those around you to bear the cross after Jesus. In every perplexity ask God for advice and counsel, and it will be given. When your mind is troubled, go to the Lord Jesus and ask Him to give you His grace. Cast all your care upon Him who cares for you. \u201cIn everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.\u201d",
