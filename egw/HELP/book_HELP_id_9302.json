While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have my being. Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.' 'Praise ye the Lord from heavens; praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels, praise ye him, all his hosts; praise ye him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light.'\" . .",
