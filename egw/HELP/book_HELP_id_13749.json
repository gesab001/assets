Those bearing the chief responsibilities in that institution can be a great help to one another if they will seek to understand the Lord's instruction. I have great hope that as you and Brother and Sister Burden fill your important places, you will realize the presence of a spiritual helper, One who is ever ready to be the head of your councils. I pray that you will feel His divine presence. Under His guidance none of you need become discouraged.",
