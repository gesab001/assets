    "word": "Churches of believers are to be developed. Meetinghouses are to be built. Facilities for caring for the sick are to be provided. Small books specially prepared to meet the needs of the people, are to be given a wide circulation. In all the large cities of the South the light of present truth is to shine forth to the colored people. And in all parts of the field, the believers, by a wise use of the talent of speech and by practical Christian Help work, are to live out the truth before those who know it not.",
