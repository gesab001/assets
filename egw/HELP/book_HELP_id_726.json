    "word": "This Samaritan, said Christ, was neighbor to him who fell among thieves. The Levite and the priest represent a class in the church who manifest an indifference to the very ones who need their sympathy and help.

The Samaritan represents a class who are true helpers with Christ, and who are imitating His example in doing good.",
