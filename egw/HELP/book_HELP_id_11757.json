    "word": "We feel very sad to think that so much money has been piled up in buildings in Battle Creek. This outlay of means, unadvised by the Lord, has crippled every new missionary field, because the treasury in Battle Creek has been left destitute of means. They could not help us to start the work from the great center because the means was misappropriated. This warning has been given to them over and over again. We cannot obtain means from the center in Battle Creek to advance the work because they have erected so many buildings that the means is not to be had.",
