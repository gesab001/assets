It is that faith which makes Christ your own personal Saviour\u2014that faith which, recognizing your helplessness, your utter inability to save yourself, takes hold of the helper who is mighty to save, as your only hope. It is faith that will not be discouraged, that hears the voice of Christ saying, \u201cBe of good cheer, I have overcome the world, and my divine strength is yours.\u201d . . . \u201cLo, I am with you alway.\u201d",
