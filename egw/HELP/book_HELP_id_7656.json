    "word": "The armies of heaven are to be the helpers of all who do God's work, and those who claim to be children of God and to keep His commandments, must give evidence to the world that the truth has worked a reformation in their hearts, purifying the soul and refining the ideas and tastes. They must show that they are willing to learn, willing to be advised by Moses, whose instruction came from the Lord. The words spoken to the children of Israel regarding cleanliness are addressed to all who have untidy habits. They are bidden to cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the \n87\nflesh and of the spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. The Lord's eye cannot behold with favour uncleanness of any kind in any family.",
