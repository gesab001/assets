    "word": "The history of the apostle Paul is a constant testimony that manual labor cannot be degrading, that it is not inconsistent with true greatness or elevation of Christian character. Those toilworn hands he deemed detracted nothing from the force of his pathetic appeals, sensible, intelligent, and eloquent beyond those of any man who had acted a prominent part in the Christian ministry. Those toilworn hands, as he presented them before the people, bore testimony that he was not chargeable to any man for his support. He worked day and night to avoid being chargeable to his brethren. And at times he also supported his fellow workers, himself suffering from hunger in order to relieve the necessities of others. He shared his earnings with Luke, and helped Timothy to obtain the necessary equipment for his journey.",
