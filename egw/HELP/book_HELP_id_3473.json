    "word": "To Reform Medical Practices \n\n     As to drugs' being used in our institutions, it is contrary to the light which the Lord has been pleased to give. The drugging business has done more harm to our world and killed more than it has helped or cured. The light was first given to me why institutions should be established, that is, sanitariums were to reform the medical practices of physicians.--Letter 69, 1898.",
