    "word": "I am deeply impressed that Trenton will be a central interest, as well as Brooklyn, and still other localities outside the city of New York. We see indeed the fields in every direction in and outside of New York to be worked. There should be a hall secured to call the people together in New York City, and from surrounding localities out of New York City. Will all who are now interested in this work during the Week of Prayer make their gifts and offerings, as the Spirit of the Lord shall prompt them to do, in helping the objects of religious missions that are greatly in need of help? Do not feel if you do this, you are robbing the very needy localities that present themselves at the present time.--Letter 183, 1901, pp. 1-4. (To \"Dear Brother,\" November 12, 1901.)",
