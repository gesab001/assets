    "word": "When I returned I found letters awaiting me. One from Edson stated that my account at the office had swelled to the enormous sum of seven thousand dollars. This is, much of it, in publishing Volume IV, Great Controversy, and Patriarchs and Prophets, which they have not handled but have let fall dead from the press, while Bible Readings has been extolled and all the canvassers have been educated to work for it. This is an object lesson of how much value they bestow upon that which the Lord sends in testimonies. Well, I am informed that I can draw no more from the office, and now I must cast about to see what I shall do next. I trust in the Lord, that He will open the way before me and put it into the hearts of those who might help me to do so by educating the canvassers to handle my books.",
