    "word": "I thank God that you have this school. Do not allow your teachers to be overworked, but help them in the advancement of their work. I thought we should ask Sister Peck to connect with our new conference school in California; but I cannot do this: for I see that she has a work to do here. Will you not help her in this work? And will you not secure other teachers also who will make a business of educating the students in a knowledge of the Scriptures?--Ms 31, 1909, p. 5. (\"Individual Cooperation,\" Sermon, April 17, 1909.)",
