    "word": "By the hand of faith grasp the promises of God and be upon vantage ground. Then you will be where Satan cannot come near and say, \"God cannot help you, because you have sinned and you cannot claim the promises.\" The adversary desires to have us think that the way to life is so difficult that it will be impossible to reach the bliss of heaven. But God has placed us in circumstances where the very best of our natures may be developed and the highest faculties may be exercised. If we cultivate the good, the objectionable tendencies will not gain the supremacy, and at last we shall be accounted worthy to join the family above. If we desire to be saints above we must be saints upon the earth.",
