    "word": "Brother Jones, be careful in your words. You know the truth, and I urge you for Christ's sake to practice the truth. You need the converting power of God every day. May the Lord help you, my brother; for He has greatly blessed you. You need the spirit of meekness and gentleness, of patience and forbearance, and of love for your brethren. Take heed how you build; for the structure will be tested.--Letter 91, 1899, pp. 1, 2, 5. (To A. T. Jones, May 1, 1899.)",
