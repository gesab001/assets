    "word": "Chap. 53 - Student Opportunities\n\n     Students, co-operate with your teachers. As you do this, you give them hope and courage. You are helping them, and at the same time you are helping yourselves to advance. Remember that it rests largely with you whether your teachers stand on vantage ground, their work an acknowledged success. In the highest sense you are to be learners, seeing God behind the teacher, and the teacher co-operating with Him.",
