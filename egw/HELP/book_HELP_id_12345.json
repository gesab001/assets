    "word": "We are pressing with all our might the Volume 4 to its completion. The printers are driving us fast, and I believe we shall have hard work to keep up with them. I have next the Volume 1 to get out, then to revise Volumes 2 and 3. If the dear Lord will help me, I shall be able to do this work. Marian has a heavy load upon her.
