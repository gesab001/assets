    "word": "\"I have gone through experience after experience that has taught me that the enemy of our work would be pleased to see introduced a policy regarding wages that would bring us into trial. God is not in any arrangement that permits a man to specify how much he should receive. When one says that he cannot labor in one of our institutions unless he is treated just so and so, why others will feel at liberty to make similar demands. It will not do for us to adopt any policy that will open the way for such results. When this question has been up for consideration in times past, the Lord has given clear light over and over again, that no man be permitted to mark out the exact course he is to pursue; for to allow this would bring the cause very soon into a state of confusion. God will help us, if we walk in the light of His counsel.",
