    "word": "Dr. Kellogg should never have encouraged these men to depend upon him to be mind and brains for them. He has served tables too much. There should be a superintendent who possesses breadth of thought and independence of judgment, that will use the powers of his own brain and grow in capacity and judgment, becoming every year more and more capable of bearing responsibilities. It is a sin and a shame to call the mind of Dr. Kellogg to so many little matters, and he does these men a wrong in allowing it. He cannot grasp his arms around the \n\n\n                                -291- \n\nentire institution. He must train his helpers to be self-reliant, independent, wise generals, in place of acting as general over everything himself.",
