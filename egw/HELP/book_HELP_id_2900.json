    "word": "215\n     The church at Christiania have not a twentieth part of the influence they might have possessed, if they had rightly improved their opportunities and privileges. Their ideas are altogether too narrow. Each should turn his attention to himself, to make the most of every advantage, that he may become a help and strength to the church. God has committed to them sacred truths, through which they are to be sanctified and to reflect light to the world. They are to show what the truth can do for even coarse, rough stones out of the quarry of the world. What these brethren need is elevation of thought, and refinement of character. They need to make the Bible their guide; the study of God's holy word will strengthen and expand the mind. But they must learn the truth as it is in Jesus, or they might better never have received it. It is not the mere reading of the word that gives light, but the word opened to the understanding and applied to the heart by the Spirit of God.",
