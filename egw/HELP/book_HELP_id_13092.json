Morrison\n\n                                                  M - 47 - 1892 \n\n                         George's Terrace, St. Kilda Road, \n                             Melbourne, Dec. 22, 1892. \n\nDear Brother Morrison,- \n     Your kind letter is received, and I thank you for writing me. I am glad to report I am much improved in health. I do not now have to be carried up and down stairs. I was taken up the Echo Office stairs last Monday. I then said I shall try to walk up and down stairs alone and I have done so by help of the baluster; of course it is taxing to my limbs after being helpless nearly nine months. But I praise the name of the Lord for His mercy and love and the rich blessings which He has graciously given me since being in this country.",
