    "word": "The work in the South must now receive attention. It has \n\n                              -381- \n\nstood in an unfinished condition long enough. I now expect that the necessities of this work will be seen and understood, and that our people everywhere will be encouraged to send donations great and small to Nashville. The workers there have waited patiently until the Washington Fund should be made up. This fund has been made up, and help should now be given to Nashville, to carry forward the work that must be accomplished. \n\n\n                                (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
