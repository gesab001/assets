    "word": "The Lord has directed Brethren Sutherland and Magan, men of sound principles, to establish the work at Madison. They have devised and planned and sacrificed in order to carry the work there after God's order; but the work has been long in coming to completion. It is the privilege of these brethren to receive gifts from any of our people whom the Spirit of the Lord impresses to help. They should have means--God's means--with which to do the Lord's work.",
