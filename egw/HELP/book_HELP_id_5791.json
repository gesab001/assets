    "word": "The little ones should be educated in childhood in childlike simplicity. They should be trained to be obedient, upright, and practical, doing their best in everything, and at the same time to be content with the small, helpful duties, and with the pleasures and experiences natural to their years. Childhood answers to the blade in the parable, and the blade has a beauty peculiarly its own. The children should not be forced into a precocious maturity, but should retain as long as possible the freshness and grace of their early years.",
