    "word": "The Lord presented before me the way in which the work should be carried on in our large cities. I was instructed by the Lord that Elder Haskell, who has a wide experience, should open up the work in New York upon correct plans, commencing missionary work after the Lord's order. Let no man interpose himself to block Elder Haskell's way. His work can be hindered, but God forbid that it should be. Clear the way for the aged servant of the Lord. Help him all you can. Do not allow meetings to be held where they will draw people away from the very interest which the Lord desires to see advanced, that souls may be won to Christ.",
