    "word": "God will not occupy a divided heart or reign from a divided throne. Every rival that holds the affections and diverts them from the God of love must be dethroned. The Lord demands all that there is of us, and there must be no reserve. Christ has purchased us, we are His heritage, and we are to be honored by being co-laborers with Jesus Christ. Wear the yoke with Christ, and daily walk with God. How shall we do this? By laying hold upon the help which God has provided.  The Lord has said, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\" (Matthew 7:7).",
