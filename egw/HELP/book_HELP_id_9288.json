    "word": "I was shown that Dr. Ginley is too easily discouraged. There will ever be things arising to annoy, perplex, and try the patience of physicians and helpers.

They are exerting an influence which will be reflected by the patients in other States, and which will be reflected back again upon the Health Institute for good or for evil. They should \n                                                                           44\never consider that they are dealing with men and women of diseased minds, who frequently view things in a perverted light, and yet are confident that they understand matters perfectly. Physicians should understand that a soft answer turneth away wrath. Policy must be used in an institution where the sick are treated, in order to successfully control diseased minds, and benefit the sick. If physicians can remain calm amid a tempest of inconsiderate, passionate words; if they can rule their own spirits when provoked and abused; they are indeed conquerors. \"He that ruleth his own spirit, is greater than he that taketh a city.\" To subdue self, and bring the passions under the control of the will, is the greatest conquest men and women can gain.",
