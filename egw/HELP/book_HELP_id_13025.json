Do not leave the work which needs to be done, because it appears to your judgment to be small and inconsiderable. Make up every waste place, repair the breaches as fast as they occur. Let no differences or dissensions exist in the church. Let all go to work to help someone who needs help. There is a cause for the great weakness in our churches, and that cause it is hard to remove. It is self. Men have none too much will, \n                                                                           722\nbut they must have it wholly sanctified to God.

If we are united to Christ, we shall be united to one another. (See John 13:34: Romans 15:1-5.)",
