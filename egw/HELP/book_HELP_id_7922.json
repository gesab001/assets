    "word": "Obey, obey, for Christ's sake and for your own soul's sake. Obey that which your conscience tells you is truth. Accept the grace and righteousness of Christ. God is tenderly calling you, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). If you refuse the invitation to repentance, to freedom from sin, the great day of God will find you hopeless, shelterless, disobedient, a transgressor of His law. He will not then be able to give you a place in His kingdom. God help you to come now, is my prayer.--Letter 80, May 24, 1900, to a layman in Australia.",
