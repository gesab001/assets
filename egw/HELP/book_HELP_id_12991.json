    "word": "Now I beseech of you that are here today, that have cherished sins, whatever they may be, clear it out of the way. God help you to be converted. Oh, I see the smiles of Jesus today. I am so grateful. I know that God will help us if we will clear the King's highway. I hoped, Brother Porter, when you were at Kansas, and the Spirit of the Lord came upon you, I hoped you might be in the light; but you are not in the light. Do not be surprised if I, when you are in the darkness, refuse to have an interview with any of you. I have told you over and over again. Christ said: \"Why do you not hear my words?\" I would say, \"Why do you not hear the words of Christ that are presented to you? Why will you have darkness? They are so afraid to see that there is another ray of light. They will build up every conceivable barrier against it. \n                                                                           596\nYou are working just as the Jews were. Do not hang on to Brother Smith. In the name of God, I tell you, he is not in the light. He has not been in the light since he was at Minneapolis. You have gathered together, you have built up yourselves, and you have tried in every way to resist the Spirit of God. May God have compassion on your souls.",
