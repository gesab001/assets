    "word": "We have forfeited all by sin. If we have any mercies and blessings it is by grace. We have not a blessing but that comes through Jesus Christ. Those who are sinners and disloyal to God are not to be trusted to pass wise judgment in regard to that upon which great results depend. In our course of action Satan will be on hand to put suggestions in the mind and words in the mouth that are entirely contrary to God's mind and God's will. Those that advocate these ideas may be honest in their advice because they are blinded and deceived. How safe is the man whose God is our God. Christ is our Advocate, pleading in our behalf. The Spirit pleads with us. Then let us show perfect trust in our Leader and not inquire of false guides. They will \n\n\n                                    -248- \n\nmislead, entangle, and ruin us, if they can. Will not God be dishonored if we depend on men of the world, whose wisdom God pronounces to be foolishness. Let us go to the fountain of wisdom. Will He not help us?",
