    "word": "The efficiency of the Lord's work upon the earth depends upon those whom He has made stewards of His means. We cannot afford to practice robbery toward God. If we are true to Him, we may be assured of His help. There must be harmonious action among those who are members of the body of Christ. My sister, God has entrusted to you the work of blessing and comforting those of like precious faith. Look up and believe in Jesus, and by your example, be a light to others. He has given His precious life to save you, and He wants you to respond to His love with cheerful service.",
