Some are naturally inclined to sermonize rather than to teach. But on such occasions as our annual camp meetings we must never lose sight of the opportunities afforded for teaching the believers how to do practical missionary work in the place where they may live. In many instances it would be well to set apart certain men to carry the burden of different lines of educational work at these meetings. Let some help the people to learn how to give Bible readings and to conduct cottage meetings. Let others bear the burden of teaching the people how to practice the principles of health and temperance, and how to give treatments to the sick. Still others may labor in the interests of our periodical and book work. [SUCH CONTACTS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO RECRUIT NEW LITERATURE EVANGELISTS.] And let chosen workers take a special interest in teaching many how to handle Christ's Object Lessons and Ministry of Healing.--9T 81-83.",
