    "word": "ANGELS SURPRISED THAT HUMANS PRAY SO LITTLE.\u2014What can the angels of heaven think of poor helpless human beings, who are subject to temptation, when God\u2019s heart of infinite love yearns toward them, ready to give them more than they can ask or think, and yet they pray so little, and have so little faith? The angels love to bow before God; they love to be near Him. They regard communion with God as their highest joy; and yet the children of earth, who need so much the help that God only can give, seem satisfied to walk without the light of His Spirit, the companionship of His presence.\u2014(Steps to Christ, 94.)",
