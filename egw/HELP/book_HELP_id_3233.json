    "word": "\"When Martin Luther received discouraging news, he would often say, 'Come, let us sing the forty-sixth psalm.' This psalm commences with the words: 'God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.' Instead of mourning, weeping, and despairing, when troubles gather about us like a flood and threaten to overwhelm us, if we would not only pray for help from God, but would praise Him for so many blessings left,--praise Him that He is able to help us,--our course would be more pleasing to Him, and we would see more of His salvation.\" [REVIEW AND HERALD, NOV. 1, 1881.]",
