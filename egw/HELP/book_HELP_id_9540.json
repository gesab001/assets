    "word": "Dear Brethren and Sisters: I deeply feel the necessity of our making more thorough and earnest efforts to bring the truth before the world.  In the last vision given me, I was shown that we were not doing one-twentieth part of the work we should for the salvation of souls. We labor for them indifferently, as though it was not a question of every great importance whether they received or rejected the truth. General efforts are made, but we fail to work to the point by personal effort. We do not approach men and women in a manner that impresses them that we have a personal interest for them, and that we feel \n                                                                           13\ndeeply in earnest for their salvation, and do not mean to give them up. We hold too much at a distance those who do not believe the truth. We call them and wait for them to come to us to inquire for the truth. Many will not be inclined to do this, for they are in darkness and error, and cannot discern the truth and its vital importance. Satan holds them with his firm power, and if we would help them, we must show a personal interest and love for their souls, and take hold of them in earnest. We must work in prayer and love, with faith and unwearied patience, hoping all things and believing all things, having the wisdom of the serpent and the meekness of the dove, in order to win souls to Christ. . . .",
