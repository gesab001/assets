    "word": "MR No. 930 - Things That Impeded Ellen White's Work\n\n     Caution Not to Retard or Rush God's Work, But Wait for Him to Work--Be careful not to make any move that will retard this work. There is much to be done, but the Lord would not have you or me fret our lives away, and lose our faith and courage because this work does not move as fast as we think it ought to. The Lord will help us if we will keep the word of His patience. I sometimes ask myself whether it can be my duty to go on writing the same things over and over again, just because our people will not heed what is already written. I do not wish to overtax myself and unbalance my mind by trying to perform impossibilities.",
