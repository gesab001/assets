    "word": "Lift up heart and soul in praise to God because He has acknowledged you as His child. He will make you His helping hand, and will bless you in the work of trying to help other souls. The Holy Spirit will work every heart susceptible to its holy influence. Christ's righteousness will go before such an one, and the glory of the Lord will be his rearward.--Letter 192, Nov. 30, 1902, to W. O. Palmer, one of J. E. White's helpers in his work for the blacks of the Southern States.",
