    "word": "\"Not Slothful in Business\" \n\n     The word of inspiration tells us that we are to be \"not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\" Let all who are connected with our sanitariums take hold of their work interestedly and earnestly. If helpers have not learned the science of being quick, let them begin at once to train themselves in this line, or else consent that their wages shall be proportionate to the amount of work done. Every day nurses and helpers should become more efficient, more all-round and helpful. They can individually help themselves to reach a higher and still higher standard as the Lord's helping hand. Let those who are naturally slow train themselves day by day to do their work more quickly, and at the same time carefully. . . . \n                                                                           270",
