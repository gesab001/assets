    "word": "I have been shown that with proper management the Huntsville school and the Graysville school could be self-supporting. But I was instructed, also, that the difficulties to be overcome in the Huntsville school would be far greater than in some other schools. A school for colored students cannot be compared with or treated in the same way as a school for white students. Not  all that ought to have been done for the Huntsville school has been done, and those who take the management of the school in the future will have a trying time. But God will be with them if they make Him their dependence. This school has land, and the cultivation of fruit should be carried on. But the school cannot do this without help.",
