    "word": "Perfection of Character \n\n     We are to be individual toilers. Character cannot be bought or sold. It is formed by patient, continuous effort. Much patience is required in the striving for that life which is to come. We may all strive for perfection of character, but all who come into possession of it will earn it step by step, by the cultivation of the virtues which God commends. The Holy Spirit presents before man the agencies provided for his transformation. If he heeds the words, \"He that will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me,\" he will receive help from a power that is infinite. \n                                                                           91",
