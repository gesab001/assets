    "word": "Children, you can do much for the Lord. Ask your parents to give you the money they are planning to spend in buying you presents, and bring this money to the Lord Jesus. The cause of God is in great need of money. Just at this time there are precious instrumentalities belonging to God in danger of being lost to the cause. The Sanitarium in Denmark and the Publishing House in Norway are in great need of help. We cannot afford to see these precious institutions passing out of our hands. Let children be taught to practice self-denial in regard to spending money for themselves or their friends. Let \n\n\n                                       -10- \n\nthem make presents to God by helping His oppressed institutions. Children, bring your offerings to the Lord. Let them be offerings of self-denial, because you are anxious to act as the Lord's helping hand in doing missionary work. Some can give but little, but by His blessing the Lord can make that little go a long way.--Ms 71, 1900, pp. 1, 2. (\"Children to be the Lord's Helpers,\" December 3, 1900.)",
