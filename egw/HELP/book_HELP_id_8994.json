    "word": "My brother, the Lord will lead you, but never, never through a human agency that is under the influence of the enemy of our souls. The Lord has given you a most favorable place in which to care for the sick, and to labor in His service, and He will bless you and your wife so long as you look to Him for guidance. But if you lean upon human help, you will find that your dependence is as a broken reed. I am bidden to say to you and your wife, Guard yourselves against every deceptive influence. As you do this, God will tenderly lead and guide you, and bless you in your position of responsibility.",
