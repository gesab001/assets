    "word": "Miss Lucas, a young woman whom I should suppose to be about 26 years old, is my seamstress. Edith Ward, I took out of pity. She was 12 years old when she came to live with me, and is now 14. She is Sarah Belden's maid, and helps her in the kitchen. Edgar, a boy of about 15, does the chores about the place such as cutting wood, attending to the fires, etc. Mr. Connell is my outdoor manager, caring for the horses and farm work.
