    "word": "A Proposed Plan of Co-operation \n\n                  College View, Neb., Sept. 21, 1904. \n\nDear Brethren Hayward and Hansen:-- \n\n\n     I have received your letters, and there are some things that I wish to say in response. I wish to speak of some things presented before me concerning the establishment of the school, [REFERENCE IS HERE MADE TO THE MADISON SCHOOL, THE SITE FOR WHICH HAD JUST BEEN SELECTED.] and the sanitarium that is to be established near Nashville. Careful attention is to be given to the advantage that may be gained in locating these institutions near each other. In regard to the institutions to be established in Takoma Park I was shown that the Lord would certainly be honored were these institutions placed near enough together to be a help and a blessing to one another.",
