    "word": "There are at Redlands some brethren and sisters who are able to help the institution with their means. We hope to meet these people, and to inspire in them such confidence in the management of the sanitarium that they will feel free to give of their means and make liberal loans. The sanitarium is just beginning its work, and it greatly needs this help. The Lord has worked on minds, and a much more favorable condition of things exists here now than has existed for some time. We hope much from this, and we pray much that the Lord may soften hearts by His grace, and that His truth may triumph. \n\n\n                                   -232-",
