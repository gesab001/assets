    "word": "If we have that faith that works by love and purifies the soul, we shall gain an experience of more value than gold or silver or precious stones. The Holy Spirits works in the children of obedience. He who is a partaker of the divine nature will think the thoughts of God. His perceptions will be sanctified by the grace of Christ. He will work in Christ's lines, manifesting His kindness, thoughtfulness, mercy, and love, helping and not discouraging those around him.",
