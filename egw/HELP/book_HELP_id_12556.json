    "word": "As we listen to the words of Christ we will get truth. It is light; it is the way we are to travel to reach the heaven of eternal rest. It is the truth, and let us hang our helpless souls upon it. Not upon the minister, for you will find this a broken reed. Whom shall we hang our souls upon? Upon Him whose arm is strong to save to the utmost all that come to Him. How shall we come? Well, we will read a little farther: \"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\" This is away down this side of the crucifixion of Christ. Is not His law there? \"God [had] no law to govern in heaven the angelic host, and on \n\n\n                                    -230- \n\nearth the inhabitants of the earth!\" Did He ever mean that such a statement should come from human lips? Never, never. This is the reason that the earth has fallen to the depths that it has. For this reason it is that the souls of parents and children are in danger. For this reason we read of robbery and murder and the depravity that everywhere comes to our notice.",
