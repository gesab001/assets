    "word": "Each of us has a work to do for the Master. Will we do this work? Will we labor with unselfish, self-sacrificing interest to build up His cause, to advance His work? I am determined to do the will of God, to make straight paths for my feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way. There are halting, lame ones enough to be stumbled by the unchristian doings of many who name the name of Christ. But God forbid that any of those who have had a knowledge of and an experience in the workings of God and His ways, should themselves be halting and need to be carried. Let them come up to help; let them become spiritually strong by doing the will of our heavenly Father; and then they can help the halting, lame ones.",
