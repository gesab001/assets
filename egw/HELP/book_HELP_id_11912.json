    "word": "Do you appreciate salvation? Do you appreciate the great sacrifice that has been made for you? If you do, God help you to deny yourselves, and make this sacrifice for your fellow men. \"Love one another, as I have loved you,\" said Christ. He left the glory and splendor which He enjoyed on high. None of these were sufficient to hold him there and prevent Him from coming down to elevate you. And now are you willing to engage in the work with all your energies, and help your fellow mortal around you? God give you a spirit of self-denial.",
