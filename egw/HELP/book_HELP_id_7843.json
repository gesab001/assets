    "word": "There are many who view themselves as defective in character when they look into God's moral mirror, His law, but they have heard so much of \"All you have to do is to believe\" ... that after venturing to look into the mirror they straightway go from it retaining all their defects, with the words on their lips, \"Jesus has done it all.\" These are represented by the figure that James has marked out--the man beholding himself and going away and forgetting what manner of man he was.... Faith and works are the two oars that must be used to urge the bark against the current of worldliness, pride, and vanity; and if these are not used, the boat will drift with the current downward to perdition. God help us to take care of the inward adorning, to set the heart in order as carefully as we arrange the outward apparel.",
