    "word": "In your experience perhaps you may say, \"I have tried to save this one and that one, and they have only wounded me, and I am not going to try to help them any more.\" But do not become discouraged if they do not at once return to the fold.

But if you faint before the harvest time shall come, you will lose all the reward.",
