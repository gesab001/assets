    "word": "It will not help you in the least to keep mourning over your defects. Say, \"Lord, I cast my helpless soul on Thee, and Thee alone. I will not worry, because Thou hast said, 'Ask, and ye shall receive.'\" Believe that you do receive. Believe that your Saviour is full of compassion, full of tender pity and love. Let not little mishaps trouble you. Small mistakes may be ordered by the Lord to save you from making larger mistakes.",
