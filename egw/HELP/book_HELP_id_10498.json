    "word": "We are to direct the weapons of our warfare against our foes, but never to turn them toward those who are under marching orders from the Kings of kings, who are fighting manfully the battles of the Lord of lords.

They should not turn the glory of God to dishonor, and give an advantage to the bitterest foes of their King.",
