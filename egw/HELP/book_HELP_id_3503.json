    "word": "Health Through Service for Others \n\n     Those who, so far as it is possible, engage in the work of doing good to others by giving practical demonstration of their interest in them, are not only relieving the ills of human life in helping them bear their burdens, but are at the same time contributing largely to their own health of soul and body. Doing good is a work that benefits both giver and receiver. If you forget self in your interest for others, you gain a victory over your infirmities. \n                                                                           106\nThe satisfaction you will realize in doing good will aid you greatly in the recovery of the healthy tone of the imagination.",
