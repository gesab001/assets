    "word": "(700) Portion of a Letter from J. A. Burden to W. C. White, \n                         Nov. 18, 1908. \n\n\n     I am studying most carefully the question of how our medical work should develop. I can see very plainly the wonderful help that has come to us by having the Bible work made strong. If we only had something better in the way of clinical work for advanced students it would be a great blessing. I have been taking up correspondence with the Medical Board of Examiners, also with the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association of Colleges, to learn what I could in reference to the latter question. I can see clearly if we are to launch a fully accredited college to stand along side of other medical colleges, duplicating their work, that it will be a big proposition. But if we were to do, say, three solid years' work such as would be recognized with that of other schools, and fit workers for \n\n\n                                 -391- \n\nevangelistic work at home or in foreign fields, and at the same time would be counted for about two years in a recognized medical school, it seems to me it would open the way to the accomplishment of all that we want. It would give the student that which would enable him to stand when he entered these other Medical Colleges. I am going to correspond further, to see if such a plan can be worked out. If we could obtain a charter and incorporate our college in such a way as to carry out our plans, I believe it would be a step in the right direction.",
