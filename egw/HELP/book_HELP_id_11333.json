    "word": "Human assertions, even from priests and rulers, will not help my case. I must know what conditions are imposed on me, that I may cooperate with God in the saving of my own soul. I cannot satisfy the claims of God upon me as his human agent, by meeting the ideas and opinions of even teachers of doctrines, unless they harmonize with the voice of God. \"What saith the law? How readest thou?\" is the question from the greatest of all teachers.",
