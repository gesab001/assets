    "word": "Right impressions cannot be made upon the sick when those who compose the sanitarium family of helpers are disagreeable or uncouth in manner, or cherish a spirit of frivolity or are subject to jealous freaks. Such workers should not be retained in our institutions, for the enemy is always ready to work upon such minds and through their influence to drive souls away from Christ. Far better would it be to pay higher wages and secure good, sensible helpers in our institutions than to accept those whom you cannot discipline and train.",
