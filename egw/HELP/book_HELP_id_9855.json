    "word": "Those who have fallen by sin and iniquity may receive the pardoning love of God. By repentance and faith, the transgressors of His law may come to God through Christ. And when we have come to Christ, and have taken the steps requisite in conversion, we are to \"seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.\" Colossians 3:1. When we are burdened with care and sorrow, why do we not go to our Saviour, and claim His promises, and find Him a very present help in every time of trouble? We are not left to be the sport of Satan's temptations. God has given us precious promises, by which we are to become partakers of the divine nature. 2 Peter 1:4. In Christ is our help. When we come with repentance and faith, however polluted and sinful we may be, we shall find Him the sinner's Saviour. He has said, \"I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\" The sinner may carry his load to Calvary, and lay it down at the foot of the cross. It is the privilege of every one to leave sin and transgression, and to become a loyal subject of the God of heaven. We may be clothed with the righteousness of Christ, but His righteousness will not be a covering for the least iniquity. \"Wash you, make you clean;\" for there has been a fountain opened for Judah and Jerusalem, and every stain may be cleansed away. Isaiah 1:16-18.",
