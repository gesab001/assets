    "word": "Will the people of God frown down all this corrupting influence? Will they give their hearts to God? Will they deal mercifully with their fellow mortals? Will Seventh-day Adventists bear in mind that they cannot swerve from truth in their dealings with their fellow beings, that they cannot violate justice or let go their integrity without forsaking God? Anything that dishonors Him will never benefit you. People who expect to prosper by violating the eternal principles of righteousness are laying up for themselves a harvest they will not care to reap. They place themselves in the enemy\u2019s ranks and bring degradation upon themselves. Although for a time they may seem to prosper, they can never help to compose the family of God.\u2014Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, pp. 133, 134.",
