    "word": "In the cross of Calvary we see our liberty, the claim of power that will be safe for us to exercise. Strong, deep sympathies, pure, powerful heavenly principles, are the indispensable agencies to be brought into the work for this time. Self, with its baleful results, has figured largely enough. We need now an indwelling Saviour, who will supply the pure current of love, and maintain principles that will inculcate the sum of all righteousness, purity, holiness, and perfect benevolence. This will show that we love God with all the heart, and our neighbor as ourselves. The moral taste is to be refined and elevated. Our passions are to be brought under control because we wear the robe of Christ's righteousness. The gospel is to be lived. Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, are the fruits borne upon the Christian tree. God help us to be right with Him.--Letter 138, 1899, pp. 5, 6. (To Mrs. S. M. I. Henry, September 13, 1899.)",
