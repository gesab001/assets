    "word": "From the light that has been given me, we should fear that these men and rulers will take their position against the work and then they will act like the devil; but every advantage should be taken to get acquainted with these men; not in a way to produce anything like prejudice. We must appear to them as trying to help others, working on the line of the Christian help work. As \n\n\n                                    -68- \n\nthey see the good work we do on these lines, their prejudice will be removed in a large measure, and their hearts will be open for more. Then we should not present the Sabbath, but let us present Christ. What if they should begin to oppose you and say, Oh, that's a Seventh-day Adventist?--Lift Christ up higher and still higher. It means a great deal to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.",
