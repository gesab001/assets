    "word": "Oh, what an infinite sacrifice was paid for our redemption! Look at the long fast of Jesus Christ in the wilderness of temptation. Look at all He endured, the agony of the cross, in order to save man; and then, I ask you, What shall we do on our part? God help us that we may come under the influence, the special influence, of the Spirit of God. Then He will let it come upon us with power. He will communicate light to us from heaven, and we will walk in the light, and live in the light as He is in the light.",
