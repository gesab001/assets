    "word": "Sources: Letter 205, 1905; SW August 29, 1905; SpM pg. 380; PH163 pg. 4\n     At the Huntsville School a thorough work is to be done in training men to cultivate\n154\nthe soil and to grow fruits and vegetables. Let no one despise this work. Agriculture is the ABC of industrial education. Let the erection of the buildings for the school and the sanitarium be an education to the students. Help the teachers to understand that their perceptions must be clear, their actions in harmony with the truth, for it is only when they stand in right relation to God that they will be able to work out His plan for themselves and for the souls with whom, as instructors, they are brought in contact.",
