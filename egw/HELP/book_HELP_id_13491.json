    "word": "(360) R.-182-'07.             Glendale, Calif., May 22, 1907. Elder A. T. Robinson. Dear Brother Robinson:- \n\n\n     At our request Brother Burden has consented to visit important gatherings of our people in the Middle West, and to endeavor to secure gifts or loans for some of our Southern Calif. Sanitariums. We desire that wherever he goes, he may be given opportunity to present the work and needs of the Paradise Valley and Loma Linda Sanitariums. We need help in both places. Both at Loma Linda and Paradise Valley it has been necessary to build additions to the main building for bathrooms. This had left us with debts that must be met shortly, and we greatly need financial assistance.",
