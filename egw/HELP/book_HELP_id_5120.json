    "word": "Our Saviour's words, \"Come unto Me,...and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28), are a prescription for the healing of physical, mental, and spiritual ills. Though men have brought suffering upon themselves by their own wrongdoing, He regards them with pity.  In Him they may find help.  He will do great things for those who trust in Him.  -- MH 115. \n                                                                           132",
