    "word": "But Paul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, has said, \"Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\" This he presents to us as an encouragement rather than a discouragement: \"Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession; for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come [not with cringing fear, but] boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" \n                                                                           12",
