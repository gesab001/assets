    "word": "I wish you fully to appreciate the words that Christ spoke to help the indifferent and the deceived. Do not too readily give up your brethren and friends. \"Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But this know, that if the good-man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.\"",
