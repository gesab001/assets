    "word": "It pays us to labor for those for whom Christ has died. Our strength \n\n                                      -7- \n\nand resources can be expended in no better way. If, by the help of the Spirit of God, we can build a structure which will last through the eternal ages, what a work we have done! Cooperating with God in this work, we can think of Christ's words, so full of assurance, \"But I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.\" God cares for the human souls to whom He gave His only begotten Son, and we must see all men through the eyes of divine compassion.",
