    "word": "Not Eloquence That Makes Work Acceptable.--God wants workers who can carry the truth to all classes, high and low, rich and poor. In this work women may act an important part. God grant that those who read these words may put forth earnest efforts to present an open door for consecrated women to enter the field. Those who in their lifework have not come into contact with the higher classes of society\n103\nneed not feel that they cannot do the work. It is not eloquence that makes their work acceptable. It is through the human and contrite that the Lord works. The dignified and self-sufficient cannot touch or help needy souls.--5MR 162 (1898).",
