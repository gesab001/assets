    "word": "Study and Practical Life.--It is not well to crowd the mind with a class of studies that require intense application and exertion but that are not brought into use in the practical life. An education of this kind will be a loss to the student, for these studies take away his desire and inclination for the studies which would fit him for usefulness and enable him to fulfill his appointed responsibilities as laborers together with God to help those whom he should by precept and example assist to secure immortality.--MS 15, 1898.",
