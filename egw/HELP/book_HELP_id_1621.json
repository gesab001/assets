    "word": "The Watchman.--The Southern Watchman is an excellent paper, and one way in which you can help is by getting subscriptions for it. I urge our church members to take this paper, and to ask others to take it. It contains reading matter that is just what is needed by those not of our faith. Show this paper to your friends and neighbors. Many will subscribe for it if it is brought to their notice. It will be to them as a messenger of the gospel. Are there not children who will try to get subscribers for the Watchman?-- Manuscript 138, 1903.",
