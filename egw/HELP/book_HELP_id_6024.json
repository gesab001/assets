Children who have not been disciplined and received right instruction, have in this rebellious age but little sense of their obligations to their parents. It is often the case the more their parents do for them the more ungrateful they are, and the less they respect them.

This same disposition will be seen through their whole lives, and they will be helpless, leaning upon others for aid, expecting others to favor them, and yield to them. And if they are opposed, even after grown to manhood and womanhood, they think themselves abused; and thus they worry their way through the world, hardly able to bear their own weight, often murmuring and fretting because every thing does not suit them.",
