    "word": "Oh, may God endue us with His Spirit and make us strong in His strength! In that great day of supreme and final triumph it will be seen that the righteous were strong, and that wickedness in all its forms and with all its pride was a weak and miserable failure and defeat. We will cling close to Jesus, we will trust Him, we will seek His grace and His great salvation. We must hide in Jesus, for He is a covert from the storm, a present help in time of trouble.--Letter 6, 1884, pp. 1-4. (To G. I. Butler and S. N. Haskell, Jan. 20, 1884.) \n\nReleased August 29, 1962.",
