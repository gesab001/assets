    "word": "David's eldest brother, Eliab, . . . was jealous of David, because he was honored before him. He despised David, and looked upon him as inferior to himself. He accused him before others of stealing away unknown to his father to see the battle. . . . David repels the unjust charge, and says, \u201cWhat have I now done? Is there not a cause?\u201d David is not careful to explain to his brother that he had come to the help of Israel; that God had sent him to slay Goliath. God had chosen him to be a ruler of Israel; and as the armies of the living God were in such peril, he had been directed by an angel to save Israel.\u20141SP 371.",
