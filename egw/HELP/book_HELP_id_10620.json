    "word": "We arrived here this morning, all safe, considerably tired. The elders were looking anxiously for us both; were much disappointed in not seeing you. They say there was great disappointment upon the Vermont campground among all, but the Lord helped Brethren Haskell and Butler and they had an excellent meeting; but this did not cure the disappointment of the outsiders. There was a great turnout, expecting Elder White and wife from California would be there. They say the outsiders listened with attention and candor to the preaching.--Letter 49, 1874, p. 1. (To James White, August 28, 1874.)",
