    "word": "Look at the history of our brethren at Fresno. Men left churches that needed their help, to go to Fresno, some for their health, others in search of riches, attracted by glowing representations. The temptation to speculate came fierce and strong. Young men and men of grey hair, and even ministers of the gospel, were drawn into the sweeping current, their hopes raised high by their interest in mining shares and city lots. This was Satan's plan to bind up the means that was needed for the advancement of the cause of God.--Ms 26a, 1890, p. 2. (\"A Warning Against Financial Speculation,\" January 7, 1890.)",
