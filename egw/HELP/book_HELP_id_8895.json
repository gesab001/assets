    "word": "Among the members of our churches, there should be more house-to-house labor, in giving Bible-readings, and in distributing literature. A Christian character can be symmetrically and completely formed, only when the human agent regards it as a privilege to work interestedly in the proclamation of the truth, and to sustain the cause of God with means. The treasury must not be allowed to become empty, when there are such urgent calls for help from every part of the world.",
