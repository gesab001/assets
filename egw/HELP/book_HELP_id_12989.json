    "word": "The Need of More Personal Effort. \n\n     Too much time is given to sermonizing. There are many Christless sermons preached. I have been instructed that if less time were spent in preaching and more in personal effort, talking and praying with souls, a great deal more good would be accomplished. Our ministers need to become acquainted with those to whom they preach, that they may learn their spiritual needs and how to help them. Work of this kind is of far more value than discourses. Let our workers come into close touch with those for whom they labor. Let them advise the wealthy to lay up treasure in heaven; for where their treasure is, there will their hearts be also. Let them advise the poor to give something to the cause of God. No matter how \n                                                                           582\nsmall their offering, it will be accepted. Let them do what they can cheerfully and willingly, and God will bless them.",
