I thank you for your statement that you will help us. You ask how much the Sanitarium building will cost. I cannot tell you this; for I do not know. Dr. Caro tells me that the house they are occupying in Summer Hill is now sold, and that they will have to move out to vacate it in a few months. We are so glad that you can help us in establishing our new Sanitarium. We do not feel like specifying how much you should give. The Lord can make your heart willing to help us in our emergency.",
