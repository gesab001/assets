    "word": "Ellen White Needs Help With Domestic Duties--Lucinda, in order to do my duty in writing and helping James in his writing I ought to have a girl with me all the time to take the care of the sewing from me. For five weeks Sister Cynthia Carr has been with me, but she must soon leave and then again I shall have no help. Sometimes I think I will confine myself to my little family and attend to their wants, but if I do I am sure to lose ground and bring condemnation on myself. I hope that the Lord will raise me up suitable help, if He has a work for me to do. I cannot do my duty to my family and devote myself to the benefit of God's children too. My mind cannot be everlastingly planning and cutting and contriving, and yet be prepared to write for the Review and Instructor and answer the numerous letters sent in to me. I want to know my place and then I will try to fill it. Lucinda, I was thankful for your help when you were with us. I know that it was a great sacrifice for your mother to have you come so far from home. But if you could come home and be with me again the coming winter and spring, I should be perfectly suited.--Letter 27, 1861, pp. 1-2. (To Lucinda Hall, June 19, 1861.)",
