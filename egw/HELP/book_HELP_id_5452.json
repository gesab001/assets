    "word": "Chapter 6 \n\n     2. Co-operation With God Avoids Cain-worship.--Had man co-operated with God, there would have been no Cain-worshipers. Abel's example of obedience would have been followed. Men might have worked out the will of God. They might have obeyed His law, and in obedience they would have found salvation. God and the heavenly universe would have helped them to retain the divine likeness. Longevity would have been preserved; and God would have delighted in the work of His hands (RH Dec. 27, 1898).",
