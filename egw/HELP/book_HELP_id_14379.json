A sanitarium near Nashville is greatly needed. Dr. Hayward and Brother Hansen have done and are doing a good work in Nashville, but they are in great need of better facilities. We had hoped the way would open for them to rent a roomy place near the city, but the way has not opened for them to do this. At present, they are working under great disadvantages, and they must have a building outside the city, with room enough to care for the patients who may come.",
