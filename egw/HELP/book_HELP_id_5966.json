    "word": "Those who really possess the religion of Jesus, will not be ashamed nor afraid to bear the cross before those who have more experience than they have. They will, if they earnestly long to be right, desire all the help from older christians they can get. Gladly will they be helped by them; and a heart that is warmed by love to God will not be hindered by trifles in the christian course. They will talk out what the Spirit of God works in. They will sing it out, pray it out. It is the lack of religion, lack of holy living that makes the young backward. Their life condemns them. They know they do not live as christians should, therefore they have not confidence toward God, or before the church.",
