    "word": "There is a heaven for us to win, and there is a great \"miserableness\" for us to shun. None of us desire to be sick.

We have none too much brain power, at the best; and that which we have, we want to keep in the best possible condition, in order that we may plan with the Master, and He with us, to help our fellow human beings in suffering.",
