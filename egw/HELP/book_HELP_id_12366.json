    "word": "He is a reproach to the cause, and it would be better if he had never embraced the third angel's message than to take the course he does--appear to be full of zeal in meeting and when you look for the fruits out of meeting they are not to be found. I saw that he was too dilatory. Much of his time that he should spend in laboring with his hands to support his family and to help the cause was idled away. I saw that he would have to give an account for his strength and time that he has idled away. He is just as accountable for his time and strength as those who have property are accountable for what God has given them. God has given strength to Brother Hungerford and he has made a bad use of it. He has not spent it to the glory of God, but has felt satisfied and easy if he could go a distance to meeting and idle away his time there when it were much better for him if he was at home laboring with his hands, for he would be no benefit in meeting.",
