    "word": "Well, you may inquire, How did the people look? They were nice looking, well dressed, an intelligent appearing company. We are now trying to see what can be done in securing meetinghouses. The Methodists are building them a new house. Their old one is for sale, but they have built the new very close to the old and they may object to Sabbathkeepers worshipping in this house so close to them. The Methodist house is much larger than the little Baptist church. But the Baptist location is good, two lots, room enough to build a parsonage and to add to the building. It will have to be enlarged, if purchased, at once, for there could not be seated more than one hundred or a few more in the Baptist church. I am hoping that the Lord will open the way for something to be done in this place. Help should be given to this place and why our people do not take in the openings of such places as Petoskey is beyond my comprehension.",
