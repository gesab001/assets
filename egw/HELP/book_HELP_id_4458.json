    "word": "Stewards\n \n\n     God has placed in our hands the means to carry forward His work.--God is constantly bestowing upon you the blessings of this life; and if He asks\n260\nyou to dispense His gifts by helping the various branches of His work, it is for your own temporal and spiritual interest to do so, and thus acknowledge God as the giver of every blessing. God, as the Master-worker, co-operates with men in securing the means necessary for their sustenance; and He requires them to co-operate with Him in the salvation of souls. He has placed in the hands of His servants the means wherewith to carry forward His work in home and foreign missions. But if only half the people do their duty, the treasury will not be supplied with the necessary funds, and many parts of the work of God must be left incomplete.--RH Dec. 23, 1890.",
