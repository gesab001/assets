    "word": "In the day of final award two classes will stand before the Judge of all the earth. To those who have failed to walk in the footsteps of Christ the words will be spoken, \"Depart from me, ye that work iniquity\" (Matthew 7:23). Those who have brought the pure, unadulterated truths of the Word of God into the practical life will hear the benediction, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant:...enter thou into the joy of thy lord\" (chap. 25:21). We can never enter the City of God until we have learned to die to self, and there dwells within the soul the spirit of Christ.--Manuscript 69, Sept. 12, 1909, \"The Helpers in Our Sanitariums.\"",
