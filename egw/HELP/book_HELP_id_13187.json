    "word": "1530\n     Elisha was true to principle, true to his God. His work bore the divine credentials. And in difficulty and trial God revealed himself to him as an ever-present helper. When the sons of the prophet were enlarging their abode, a miracle was wrought to save one of them from distress. When the king of Syria was preparing an ambush against Israel, his design was revealed by the prophet. The king, learning that it was Elisha that had defeated his armies, sent an armed host to apprehend him, but God delivered his servant. All these lessons are for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.",
