    "word": "Marian Davis and Ministry of Healing.--Do not worry about the book [The Ministry of Healing]. Wait until we get home. Be of good courage. The Lord lives and reigns. Be of good courage in Him. Trust the dear Saviour as a child trusts its parents. He loves you, and in your perplexities He will be your helper and your God. Be strong in the Lord; yea, be strong.",
