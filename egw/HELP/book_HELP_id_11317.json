    "word": "Finding a Building Site in Stanmore--Our brethren are working very hard to secure a lot for a meetinghouse in Stanmore, a suburb of Sydney. These lots cannot be obtained for less than six or seven hundred pounds sterling. We really need help, and if you can help us we would be very grateful; and if you can get help from any others, please do so. I expect to have to visit Sydney and Melbourne soon. There will be a general rally then and meetings will be held over two Sabbaths and Sundays. The weather is extremely hot in both these places.",
