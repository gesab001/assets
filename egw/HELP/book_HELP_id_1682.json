    "word": "Coworkers With God\n      Pray for Personal Friends.--God will do for us greater things than we can ask or think, if we will only confide in and trust Him fully. Shall we believe, shall we move forward in faith, in hope, in courage, clinging with firm grasp to the Mighty One? . . . Let all those who profess the present truth carry out its pure and holy principles in their lives. If our sisters would only feel that they can do very much, if they will consecrate themselves to God, they could be a great help. If they would talk and labor in heavenly wisdom among those with whom they are acquainted, they could do a good work.",
