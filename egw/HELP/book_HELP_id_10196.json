    "word": "It is the privilege of parents to instill in their children the principles of Christ, and while thus doing they themselves are learning lessons that will fit them for heaven. These lessons will assist us to wear the yoke of Christ. We shall find it perfectly easy, and thus we may find an open door to heaven, and light will emanate and shine upon our pathway. Thus every mother can receive help to faithfully discharge her duty to her children.",
