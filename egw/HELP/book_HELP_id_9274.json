    "word": "Patients should be treated with the greatest sympathy and tenderness. And yet the physicians should be firm, and not allow themselves, in their treatment of the sick, to be dictated by patients. Firmness, on the part of the physicians, is necessary for the good of the patients. But firmness should be mingled with respectful courtesy. No physician or helper should contend with a patient, or use harsh, irritating words, or even words not the most kindly, however provoking the patient may be. \n                                                                           16",
