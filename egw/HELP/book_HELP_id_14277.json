    "word": "Let no man despise the humblest of employments. Christ, the Majesty of heaven, assumed the nature of humanity, and for many years worked at the carpenter's trade with Joseph.

The Lord Jesus is an Educator, and He will constantly help our Brother and Sister Shireman to become better and still better fitted for their work.",
