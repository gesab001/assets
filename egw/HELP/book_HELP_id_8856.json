    "word": "May the Lord help you to carry the work forward in the name of the Lord God of Israel, saying, \"We shall triumph in the name of God.\" When you have faith, it pleases God. \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.\" James 1:5-7. Truth and light will shine into the hearts of those who say, \"We will triumph in the God of our salvation, and He will give us the victory.\"",
