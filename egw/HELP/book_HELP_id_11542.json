    "word": "My table is furnished with fruit in its season. For several months now we will have oranges, which we can get fresh from the trees.

I also bought ten dozen lemons. Oranges and lemons are the only fresh fruit that we can get at this season of the year. By the time these are gone, early peaches will make their appearance. We will get them about Christmas-time.",
