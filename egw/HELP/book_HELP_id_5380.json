    "word": "Elder Olsen is to be president of the General Conference and Brother Dan Jones, of Kansas, is to help him. Elder Haskell will serve until Brother Olsen shall come from Europe. [IN THE ABSENCE OF GEORGE I. BUTLER, PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE, ELDER HASKELL CHAIRED THE GENERAL CONFERENCE SESSION. SHORTLY AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE SESSION, W. C. WHITE WAS ASKED TO SERVE AS ACTING GENERAL CONFERENCE PRESIDENT, WHICH HE DID FOR NEARLY SIX MONTHS.] I cannot tell what the future may reveal, but we shall remain for about four weeks in Battle Creek and get out a testimony that should come out just now without delay. Then we can see how matters move at the great center of the work. We are determined to do all we can in the fear of God to help our people in this emergency.",
