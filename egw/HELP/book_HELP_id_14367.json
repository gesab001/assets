    "word": "Our perceptive facilities must be educated to learn what is truth and what is error, and we must plant our feet upon the platform of eternal truth. This is what God requires of us and of everyone. Respect and help your teachers, and do not worry them, but help them to help you. If you keep where they can see that their efforts are responded to, then they have courage and can help you, and you can all work together as members of Christ's family here below, and then you will become members of Christ's family above.",
