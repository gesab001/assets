    "word": "My brethren of wise judgment could have managed my book--Volume IV [SPIRIT OF PROPHECY, VOL. IV, THE PREDECESSOR OF THE GREAT CONTROVERSY.]--in such a way that relief would have been brought to me. They could have published a statement to the effect that this book had cost me much time and money to prepare and put on the market; and that, as I had pledged largely for the support of missions--no less than three thousand dollars--in addition to meeting other heavy expenses, the profits on the first edition of this book would go to the author to reimburse her for a portion of the heavy expense incurred; that the profits on the second edition would be divided between the canvassers and the author. Thus you could have helped me, but you did not.",
