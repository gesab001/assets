    "word": "Deferred for a Year.--The Lord did help and bless me in a signal manner during the conference in Melbourne. I labored, before I entered it, very hard, giving personal testimonies which I had written out one year before, but could not feel clear to send them. I thought of the words of Christ, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" (John 16:12). When I enclosed the communication all ready to mail, it seemed that a voice spoke to me saying, \"Not yet, not yet, they will not receive your testimony.\"--Letter 39, 1893.",
