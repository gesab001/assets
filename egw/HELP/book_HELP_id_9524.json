    "word": "Let those who have lived so long in places where there are large churches of believers, go out into the harvest-field to sow and reap for the Master. They will forget self in the desire to save souls. They will see so much work to do, so many fellow-beings to help, that they will have no time to look for faults in others. They will have no time to work on the negative side.",
