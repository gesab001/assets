    "word": "The Lord will not disappoint any who put their trust in Him.  He will be first and last and best in everything to us.  He will be a present help in every time of need.  In these last days of service we shall ... be held, and led, and protected, by the power of Christ.  May the Lord bless and strengthen you, that your last days may be your best days, fragrant with the softening, subduing influence of His love.  The Lord bless and keep you and give you repose in His love, is my most earnest desire for you, my brother.  - TSB 31-33 (Letter 70, 1898).",
