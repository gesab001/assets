    "word": "Paul's picture that is presented before us should cause us trembling and anguish of soul. This is the state of a large share of those who have the form of godliness in these last days. The doom of the withered fig tree has a personal application. Who cannot see the living counterpart in the men and women who claim to have great light, in advance of every other people on the face of the earth, whose daily life and unholy characters belie their profession of godliness? There is a manifestation of pride and selfishness in many ways, peevish fretfulness, frivolity, discontent, uncharitableness, and censoriousness, thinking evil, speaking evil of brethren. There is no inward crucifixion of sin. The mold of Christ is not upon them, leaves of profession to conceal their deformity, but no fruit. There is more hope of the open sinner than of such. The chambers of the soul are desecrated by sin to Satan's control. Will this people be Christians? Will they heed the counsel of Christ, be zealous, and repent? Will they have true contrition of heart? Will they humble their hearts before God before it shall be forever too late? Will they repent of their backslidings? May God help you just now, in this thy day, to confess your sins, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and your name retained in the Lamb's book of life.--Letter 16, 1888, pp. 15, 16. (To Brother Rice, April 30, 1888.) \n\n\n                                    -172-",
