    "word": "Wednesday, Jan. 5, 1859. Thought of remaining at home to prepare for my journey. At noon James said they needed help at the office. I went down to help them. . . While [I was] writing, Sister McClemule came in. I must leave to talk with her. Jenny, Mother, and Willie came next. Showed them the press. While [I was] folding, Sister Cornell came in and wished me to go down street to get some things. . . . Walked down, got the things, returned to Brother Smith's for supper, then home. . . . Found Father very cheerful at home. \n\n\n                                     -137-",
