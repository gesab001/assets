    "word": "I pray much in the night season, when the condition of the churches burdens me so that I cannot sleep. On one or two nights I walked the floor, unable to sleep until three o'clock in the morning. I tell you plainly that I do not like this wakefulness. I am trying to educate myself to sleep, and the Lord is helping me. For the last few nights, I have slept until three o'clock. But when I think of the peril of souls and of the state of our churches, I am so deeply moved and so burdened that I cannot sleep.--Letter 68, 1902. (To Brother and Sister D. H. Kress, April 28, 1902.) \n\nReleased October 31, 1973.",
