    "word": "Sister Hull, your case was shown me as being very critical. You may overcome. You can redeem the time. God pities you. I saw that you have grown \n\n\n                                    -101- \n\nup with the habit of exaggerating. You have talked much and are not careful to relate matters just as they are told you or just as they exist. You talk too much. You should reflect more and talk less. . . . I saw that God pities you. Your teachings in your youth were not what they should have been, and you have therefore the stronger effort to make now to overcome that which has grown with your growth and strengthened with your strength. But by watchfulness and prayer and the patient, persevering help of your brethren you can overcome. I saw that Brother Hull has had but little help at home to bear him up and he has been sinking for some time under discouragement. God help you to arise together and make powerful efforts for everlasting life.--Letter 20, 1862, pp. 1, 2. (To Mrs. Hull, circa 1862.) \n\nReleased January 23, 1974.",
