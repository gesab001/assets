    "word": "As a people we are being watched by the world, and we should conduct ourselves in such a way that men and women will be convinced that we have something that they have not. We need the help of all who are located here. If any have concluded that they can not throw their energies into this work, there is the world before them, and they can take it. God bids His people to order their lives by the living principles that moved Christ to sacrifice himself for the saving of the lost. The Son of God gave His life to redeem the youth. What shall we do for them? What shall we do for those older in years? My brethren, you need first to order your own lives by the plan of salvation, then gather with Christ with all the powers of your being. Then the Lord will work through your efforts.",
