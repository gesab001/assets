    "word": "We need to be less diffident about making known our needs to those who can help us in carrying forward the work. The Lord will surely acknowledge determined efforts made to help the people who are in need of help. We should study carefully the second chapter of Nehemiah which records Nehemiah's request of the king, and the king's liberal response to his plea. The experiences of Nehemiah teach us that God does not prohibit his people from asking men in power for favors to advance the cause of God. Much more might be received for the advancement of the cause of God from men who have abundant resources, if the Lord's servants would lay their necessities before them. In the work of erecting sanitariums and school buildings in foreign countries God designs that the highest authorities shall be appealed to for assistance. This work should be done with prudence, taking care to present it as something that is being done for the benefit of the people, and as a work of God.",
