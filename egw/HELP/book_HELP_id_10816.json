    "word": "MR No. 549 - Sarah Peck and Ellen White\n\n     I want you to write to me. I want you to tell me how you regard the consent of Sister White to let you serve, if you will, for a little while in the school at its commencement. Tell me plainly what you think of this. We must be true yoke-fellows now. I need the help you can give me. But I must close this letter now. I appreciate my workers very much. We shall consecrate ourselves without any reservation to God. In much love, (Signed) Ellen G. White.--Letter 26, 1898, p. 3. (To Sarah Peck, March 3, 1898.)",
