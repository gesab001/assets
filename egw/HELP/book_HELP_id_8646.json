    "word": "My Saviour, reveal Thyself to this people. Let Thy love be expressed. Oh, let it be revealed! Hold Thy people, that Satan may not have his will and way with them. Help them to press through all opposition, that at last they may lay their crowns at the feet of Jesus in the city of God; and Thy name shall have all the glory. Amen.--Review and Herald, July 16, 1908.",
