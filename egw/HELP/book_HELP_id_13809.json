    "word": "When the Lord has a genuine channel of light, there are always plenty of counterfeit. Satan will surely enter any door thrown open for him. He will give messages of truth mingling with the truth ideas of his own, prepared to mislead souls, to draw the mind to human beings and their sayings, and prevent it from holding firmly to a Thus saith the Lord. In God's dealing with His people, all is quiet; with those who trust in Him all is calm and unpretending. There will be simple, true, earnest believers in the Bible, and there will be doers of the word as well as hearers. There will be sound, earnest, sensible, waiting upon God. The believer will hang his helpless soul on Jesus Christ. Christ will be exalted. Working and praying, watching and waiting, is our position. We should not desire to be recognized and to have our work appreciated in the fullest measure. Heaven is the best and safest place in which to hear from the lips of our Redeemer the result of our work.",
