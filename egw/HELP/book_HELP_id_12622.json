    "word": "Mrs. E. G. White: I should like to pray. (Praying) Our heavenly Father, we come to Thee this evening, as our only Refuge, as our only Helper, as the only One who can save us from ourselves. Oh, my heavenly Father, Thou hast heard the words that I have tried to say to this people this afternoon. And I ask Thee, Lord, that Thou wouldst make the impression. \n\n\n                                     -379- \n\nThou alone canst break the iron bands of the heart. Thou alone canst cause the blind eyes to discern what sin is. Thou alone canst impress the understanding with a realization of the character that every soul must have and reveal in this world before he can be prepared for translation into the family of heaven. Oh, my Father, my Father, the blindness, the terrible blindness, that comes over the people, that they do not discern what manner of character Thou canst accept and what Thou wilt be compelled to reject! We ask Thee, Lord, that Thou wouldst work upon minds and hearts. Oh, that Thou wouldst impress upon all the terrible nature of sin, and how Thou dost regard sin.",
