    "word": "The work here [Washington] is moving forward in clear lines. It was important that we should be here to help the workers in council. In the work that is done on the buildings, no money is to be expended for display. The buildings are to be plain and modest. A mammoth sanitarium is not to be  erected; for this is not to be a modern Jerusalem. We have told the workers this plainly. We cannot expend all the means in one place. We must make careful, economical plans.--Letter 267, 1904, pp. 1, 2. (To Brother Hayward, July 24, 1904.)",
