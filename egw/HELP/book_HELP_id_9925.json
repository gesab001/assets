    "word": "Our Duty To Our Schools. \n\n     My brethren and sisters, why is so little being done to sell \"Christ's Object Lessons\"? Have you become weary in well-doing? Have all the families in your neighborhood been supplied with the book that is so full of helpful lessons, both for parents and for children? Are there not some who did not buy a copy last year who would buy one now? Why should we not go steadily forward with this work, until millions of homes are supplied with \"Object Lessons,\" and our schools are freed from debt?",
