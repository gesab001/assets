    "word": "Cooperation Urged for the Advancement of SDA Work in Europe--Now I was shown in America that there must be here [Europe] the very same growing in the work as there was there; that all should feel that they are under obligation to God to help in the work. Then these individuals will feel that the cause of God is a part of them. I was shown that there should be additional laborers in the field to carry forward the work. Brother Matteson has had upon him a tremendous load. He has not only been laboring in the \n\n\n                                 -77- \n\nfield, but has been doing a great amount of writing. Now Brother Olsen has come here to your conference and he can take hold with Brother Matteson, and Brother Matteson with him. They can thus help each other in carrying forward this work.",
