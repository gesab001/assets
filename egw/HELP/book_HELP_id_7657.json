    "word": "We are doing what we can, according to the light given, for Australia. A direct necessity is being met by the work of women who have given themselves to the Lord, and are reaching out to help a needy, sin-stricken world, who want the truth, but do not know that they want it. Personal evangelistic work is to be done. People are to be reached by house to house labour. The women who have taken up this work do everything but preach the gospel from the pulpit. They carry the gospel to the homes of the people in the highways and the byways. They read and explain the Word to families, praying with them, caring for the sick, relieving their temporal necessities. They present before families and individuals the purifying, transforming influence of the truth. They show \n94\nthem that the way to find peace and happiness and joy is to follow Jesus.",
