    "word": "Youth and Age Uniting Forces.--How touching to see youth and old age relying one upon the other: the youth looking up to the aged for counsel and wisdom, the aged looking to the youth for help and sympathy. This is as it should be. God would have the young possess such qualification of character that they shall find delight in the friendship of the old, that they may be united in the endearing bonds of affection to those who are approaching the borders of the grave.--ST Oct 19, 1888. (SD 161.) \n\n\n                                                       747",
