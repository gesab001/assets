    "word": "These things, if allowed, deaden the moral senses and blind the mind so that crime does not appear sinful.

She may have had no unlawful purpose or motive herself, but she has given encouragement to men who are tempted, and who need all the help they can get from those associated with them. By being circumspect, reserved, taking no liberties, receiving no unwarrantable attentions, but preserving a high moral tone and become dignity, much evil might be avoided.",
