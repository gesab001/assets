    "word": "Students, you are here to obtain an education that will help you to stand by the side of Christ in unselfish service. This is the highest education that you can possibly obtain. The Word of God declares, \"Ye are laborers together with God.\" \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\" [Philippians 2:12, 13]. As you stand firm for God, filled with courage and perseverance, constantly revealing self-denial, angels from heaven will come into this school. They will keep guard over you. Your health will be precious in God's sight, because you keep His commandments. \n\n\n                                    -331-",
