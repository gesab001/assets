I offered you this and told you it was a good, simple, and wholesome drink. I remember that Sister Ings made tea for you several times by special request. You said you had a headache and must have something to help it, and you said tea always had helped you. I told her I did not like to have her do this, for it was contrary to my principles. I asked her where she got the tea, and she said that a family who were on a camping-trip had stopped here and a Mr. Wallace who was not a believer was with them, and the party had tea and made it for him, and when they had gone the tea was found here, and she supposed they must have left it. I have not bought a penny's worth of tea for years. Knowing its influence, I would not dare to use it, except in cases of severe vomiting, when I take it as a medicine, but not as a beverage.",
