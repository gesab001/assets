    "word": "I am enjoying the pure air. I wish you could spend at least one month here and recruit up before the cold weather comes. I was never where I realized a purer air. I asked that Willie and you might spend a short time here. Willie can have all the help in writing that he will need, and then you could ride some and see what there is to Petoskey and surrounding places of resort. If this place should be thousands of miles away and the advantages be presented of advancing the truth, there would be thousands of dollars spent to take advantage of the opportunity presented. But as it is within arm's reach it has been passed by indifferently and nothing has been done. I think now is the time to send in workers, canvassers, and those who ought to have been here for three months in the past doing earnest work. But I have said so much on this point I will stop. I cannot do anything, only present the matters before you. I hope and pray that the Lord will create a decided interest in home missions that are so terribly neglected.",
