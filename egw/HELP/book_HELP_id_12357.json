    "word": "Talents are of value only as they are used to accomplish the design of God. He has given human beings opportunities and privileges that they may make the very most of themselves from a Bible standpoint. If our talents are wisely used, our improvement will be a blessing to ourselves and to others. But where the talent-value is looked at only from a desire to accumulate for selfish purposes, the design of God is not carried out, and serious loss to the Master follows. Those who might have been benefited and relieved fail to receive that help the Lord designed them to have.",
