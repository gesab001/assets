    "word": "Elder Butler, how can I express the thought of the strength that my faith has gained from the experience of trusting the Lord, and in venturing to do that which He has bidden me to do in writing and in standing before audiences large and small? These occasions are my witnesses that Christ is helping me. I endeavor at all times to speak in the simplicity that Christ gives me, and when on my feet before a congregation, I know beyond a question that Christ is revealed to me with such marked distinctness that there is no more excuse for doubt and fearfulness than if He stood revealed before the whole congregation. Truly I can say, \"I know in whom I have believed.\"",
