    "word": "Many things will come up to divert the minds of God's people from the great work to which they are called. May the Lord help them to labor in such a way that they will win the crown of immortal life. \u201cTake heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end; while it is said, Today if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.\u201d Hebrews 3:12-15.",
