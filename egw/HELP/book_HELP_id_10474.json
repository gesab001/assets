    "word": "My brother, the Jewish people are not the only ones who are being helped by your work. Our own people need the example thus set before them. I bid \n\n\n                                   -212- \n\nyou be of good courage. In your labors, do not wait for some great and wonderful opening, but seize the opportunities as they come. The power of truth will be vindicated as the servants of God make faithful use of the opportunities that present themselves for labor.",
