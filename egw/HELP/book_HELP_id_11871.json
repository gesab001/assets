    "word": "To every son and every daughter of God some work has been assigned, some part of the Lord's vineyard to cultivate. Growth in grace is shown by an increased ability to work for God. He who learns in the school of Christ will know how to pray and speak for the Master. Realizing that he lacks wisdom and experience, he places himself under the training of the great Teacher, knowing that only thus can he attain perfection in God's service. And daily he becomes better able to comprehend spiritual things. Every day of diligent labor finds him at its close better fitted to help others. Abiding in Christ, he bears much fruit.",
