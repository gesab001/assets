    "word": "We are not to follow human leading. Christ is our Leader. At all times and in all places, in every time of need, we shall find Him a present help. Because there are those professing to be Christians who dishonor Christ in thought, word, and deed, we are to give plainer evidence than ever before of our completeness in Him. We are to walk in the light of His countenance. We can each show that Christ is light, and that in Him is no darkness at all. If \n\n\n                                    -385- \n\nwe will submit to His guidance, He will lead us from the low level on which sin has left us to the loftiest heights of grace.",
