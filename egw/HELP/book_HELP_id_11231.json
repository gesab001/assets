    "word": "Do not be overanxious about anything. Go quietly about your duty which the day brings you. Do the best you can; ask God to be your helper. Do what you can, and do not neglect to pray and watch thereunto and in no case neglect your religious duties. Never let your studies interfere with your religious exercises. You want to be obtaining a more thorough knowledge of the will of God as well as to advance in the sciences. If one must be neglected, let it never be religious duties. Go on from day to day doing what you well can, and be content with that. You may say, I do the best I can today and leave what I cannot do without worriment or care. And when tomorrow comes I will, in the fear of the Lord, do what I can on the morrow. Thus from day to day pursue your course of duty, trusting in God to be your helper and to give you quick perception and heavenly wisdom that you may be fitted to honor Him with your talents.",
