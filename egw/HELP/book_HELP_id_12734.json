    "word": "Let us pitch our tent a day's march nearer home. Let us determine to \"cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord.\" Let us come to the waters of life, and freely drink of the health-giving stream. May God help us to strike at the root of the matter. We are liable to be content with mere surface work; but we should never rest at ease until we are joyful in the Lord; and then we shall desire to labor for the conversion of others, that they too may receive what we have received from the Life-giver.",
