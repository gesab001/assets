    "word": "This world is God's great field of labor. He has purchased those who dwell in it with the blood of His only begotten Son, and He means that His message of mercy shall go to everyone. Those who are commissioned to do this work will be tested and tried, but they are always to remember that God is near to strengthen and uphold them. He does not ask us to depend upon any broken reed. We are not to look for any human aid. God forbid that we should put man in the place where God should be. He has promised to help us, and in the Lord Jehovah is \"everlasting strength.\". . .",
