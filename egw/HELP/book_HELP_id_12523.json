    "word": "Now, we have been getting just a glimmering of faith. We have but a little of it. Yet it is so very hard for the mind that has been looking on the dark shadows, and that has been hanging memory's hall all through with disconsolate things and pictures that are draped in mourning, that it seems as though we cannot look upon anything else. But may God help to gather up the jewels of Christ. God help us that we may hang memory's hall all through with the rich promises of God, that when Satan shall come to cast his hellish shadow between us and the source of our strength we may just be armed; we have got the memorials all surrounding us--barricaded with the promises--and we can say, \"Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation\" [Habakkuk 3:17, 18].",
