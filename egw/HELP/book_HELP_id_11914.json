    "word": "Similar advice was given to my husband, that he should let others bear the burdens, while he could aid them by his advice, counsel, and experience. But he saw that others made mistakes and were not far-seeing and judicious, that elements of character were wanting in them, which he possessed to a large degree; therefore he waited for somebody fully competent to take his place, and kept on and on in much the same way as he had done, until he finally dropped \n\n\n                                  -290- \n\ninto the grave, and those men upon whom he did not dare to leave the burdens had to take them, and that without his advice, his words of counsel, and his experience, to help them. His voice might have been heard today if he had heeded the words of warning given.",
