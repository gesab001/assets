    "word": "Close the windows of the soul earthward and open them wide heavenward. If you let the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness flood the soul temple, you will not be cross or irritable in your home. If you put away from you tobacco and liquor and all that tends of intemperance, the Lord will help you to be cheerful and serene. He does not want us to live on the flesh of animals. He has something better for us--fruits and grains. He wants us to be strictly temperate. He wants us to teach our children to be temperate, to practice self-denial.",
