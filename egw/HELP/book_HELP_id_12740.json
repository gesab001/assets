    "word": "We are to put into practice the precepts of the law, and thus have \n\n\n              -251- \n\nrighteousness before us; the rearward will be God's glory. The light of the righteousness of Christ will be our frontguard, and the glory of the Lord will be our rearward. Let us thank the Lord for this assistance. Let us constantly stand in a position where the Lord God of heaven can favor us. Let us consider that it is our high privilege to be in connection with God--to be His helping hand.",
