    "word": "Upon examination, one satchel was missing. W. C. W. rushed back to the boat and to the waiting room, but it was not found. We thought we would have to stop over for a train, which was bad for us as it would bring us into Orebro on the Sabbath. There we stood with our luggage piled on the platform, undecided what to do. It came happily into our mind that the satchel must have been taken by mistake, and was on the very train we intended to take. In a moment or two all our luggage was again placed into the car which was occupied by two gentlemen. One talked imperfect English, and we were glad that he could speak as well, as Christine had left us the night before for Norway. This gentleman helped us much in every way he could, as we were making every arrangement to secure the missing satchel.",
