    "word": "The Specific Object \nof the camp-meeting is to lead the people to discern what they must do to inherit eternal life. If the time is given up largely to the education of canvassers and workers, the spiritual standard is not elevated before the people. Many are disappointed over the failure of their expectations in gaining help from the camp-meetings, but think that the order of things cannot be changed, and that they must submit to the existing state of affairs; but decided reforms are possible and essential. Methods must be discovered, plans must be carried out, whereby the standard shall be uplifted, the people taught how they may be purified from all iniquity, and may be elevated by adherence to pure and exalted principles. \n\n\n               How to Speak.",
