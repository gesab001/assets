    "word": "Those who advocate unpopular truth should be the most consistent in their lives, and should be extremely careful to shun everything like extremes. They should not labor to see how far they can take their position from other men, but, otherwise, to see how near they can come to those they wish to reform, that they may help them to the position which they so highly prize. If they will feel thus, they will pursue a course which will recommend the truth they advocate to the good judgment of candid, sensible men and women. They will be compelled to acknowledge that there is a consistency in the subject of health reform.",
