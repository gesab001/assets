    "word": "Minister especially to those made despondent by guilt.--Ministry does not consist alone in preaching. Those minister who relieve the sick and suffering, helping the needy, speaking words of comfort to the desponding and those of little faith. Nigh and afar off, souls are weighed down by a sense of guilt. It is not hardship, toil, or poverty that lowers and degrades humanity. It is guilt, wrong-doing. This brings unrest and dissatisfaction. Jesus would have His children minister to sin-sick souls. Those that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak until they become strong.--RH July 19, 1898.",
