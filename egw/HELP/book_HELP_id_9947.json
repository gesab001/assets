    "word": "The mighty Healer said: \"Live. I have put My Spirit upon your son, W. C. White, that he may be your counselor. I have given him the spirit of wisdom, and a discerning, perceptive mind. He will have wisdom in counsel, and if he walks in My way and works out My will, he will be kept, and will be enabled to help you bring before My people the light I will give you for them. Let your light so shine before men that they may see and understand, in a special manner, that the Lord has given a message to meet the emergencies that will arise. As you speak the words I give you, angels of heaven will be with you, to make impressions on the minds of those who hear.",
