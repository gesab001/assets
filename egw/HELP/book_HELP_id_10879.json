    "word": "I would be glad to spend much time at the Health Retreat, but with your present expense to furnish the tables, every additional one increases the outlay of means, and I prudently stay away. I hope that if you set so liberal a table, you will charge accordingly, that there may be a surplus of means. If nothing is gained to help forward the improvements that must be made, what is the use of going to all this trouble and perplexity. If the boarders are lessened by a plain, wholesome diet, let them be lessened. Watch all waste. Do not allow it. I know that there is great loss here. I must tell you, Bro. and Sr. ---, that you are too much afraid of the boarders; you try too hard to meet their every desire. I should not do this. I should set a good liberal table, not getting the most expensive food, but making the fare palatable by skill and care. I felt anxious that the Health Retreat shall be all that \n\n\n                                       -392- \n\nprudence, sharp foresight, and economy can make it.--Letter 5, 1884. (To the Matron of the St. Helen Health Retreat, February 5, 1884).",
