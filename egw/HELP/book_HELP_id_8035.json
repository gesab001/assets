    "word": "In the garden of Gethsemane, Christ prayed to His Father, saying, \u201cO my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.\u201d The cup which He prayed should be removed from Him, that looked so bitter to His soul, was the cup of separation from God in consequence of the sin of the world. He who was perfectly innocent and unblamable became as one guilty before God, in order that the guilty might be pardoned and stand as innocent before God. When He was assured that the world could be saved in no other way than through the sacrifice of Himself, He said, \u201cNevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.\u201d The spirit of submission that Christ manifested in offering up His prayer before God is the spirit that is acceptable to God. Let the soul feel its need, its helplessness, its nothingness, let all its energies be called forth in an earnest desire for help, and help will come.\u2014Review and Herald, Nov. 19, 1895.",
