    "word": "Monday, Fannie asked if I could pray with her. I told her, \"Yes.\" But when I came home, I was too feeble. I could not talk with her or pray with her. I shall not talk with her again if I can help it. She can talk fluently, has no lack of words, can talk six words to my one. She must no longer have the slightest connection with me. If I had only carried out my convictions two years ago, I should have done my duty. \n                                                                           44",
