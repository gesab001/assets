    "word": "If there is anything I can put into this work, that shall go. But there are many who are willing to give of their means, but they withhold themselves. Why is it we do not find more who give themselves to this work? It is because selfishness lies at the root of the matter. There are those who come to this college, and they come to it with the object of laboring in the field, but there has been so little effort, there has been so little appreciation of their object and purposes, so little zeal to help them, that they have become discouraged. And the attraction has been so very small, the help given them so little, that many have been very slow to devote themselves to the ministry. There have been young men who could have given themselves to the ministry.",
