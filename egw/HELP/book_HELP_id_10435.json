    "word": "MR No. 264 - A Message to the President of the General Conference\n\n     You are presented before me as bowed upon your knees in prayer, pleading in an agony of soul. You are praying aloud, saying, \"Lord, I look over the field, and there is so much to do to set things in order, so much left undone that ought to be done, that I am burdened and distressed beyond measure. O Lord, who is sufficient for these things? To whom shall I go but unto Thee? Thou hast the words of eternal life. I am utterly weak, and ignorant, and helpless. Where are the poor sheep of Thy pasture, who need to be fed and watched over; but I am not able, I cannot do this great work. Take it, O Lord, it is Thy work. I am only Thy weak instrument. I see so little done in the right spirit, in the spirit that will produce results, that I am disheartened, I do not know how to work.\"",
