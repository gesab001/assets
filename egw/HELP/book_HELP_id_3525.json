    "word": "Great wisdom should be exercised in selecting men and women as instructors in our sanitariums. They should be not only those who can speak intelligently on scientific questions, but men and women who have learned to be under the rule of the Spirit of God, and who obey the instructions of Christ. They should be able to give wise counsel in a kind and intelligent manner. Fretting and scolding will not benefit, but plain words spoken in a spirit of kindness will accomplish lasting results for good. The Lord will help all who truly desire to learn of Him.",
