    "word": "We must not go to work in building our institutions, until we shall carefully look the ground over and see whether we can complete that which we have in our mind to undertake. There is danger of making rash moves which will not bear the sanction of heaven, of erecting large buildings, and binding up a large amount of God's means that is needed at the very time in other branches of the work in sustaining our poverty-stricken missions that are directly engaged in the salvation of souls. This means invested in this important work may not bring the greatest honor and flattering praise to the one who invests it; but in the heavenly records every dollar is placed to their account as treasures laid up that they will come into possession of when Christ shall come. Let none flatter themselves that it is an easy way to erect and conduct an institution upon health reform principles. It is not an easy matter to run an institution where the sick of all classes shall be treated. Every such institution should have as its managers and helpers the very best talents that the world can produce. Then they will have an educating school and be thoroughly disciplined and fitted, that representatives shall be sent out to any part of the world to impart their knowledge to those who are ignorant, and who greatly need it. This drill is to be kept up, until men and women are prepared to do the very best kind of work as educators, as well as all the time to be learning themselves, disciplining their powers to obtain increased knowledge, that they may as stewards of God have wisdom \n                                                                           26\nand light, that they can impart, too, that they are connected with in any branch of the work.",
