    "word": "The charge given to Peter by Christ just before His ascension was, \u201cFeed My lambs, \u201cFeed My sheep;\u201d and this commission has been given to every minister and worker. But the work has been neglected. While something has been done for the education and religious training of the youth, there is still a great lack. Many more need to be encouraged and helped. \n115\nThere is not that personal labor given which the case requires. It is not the ministers alone who have neglected this solemn work of saving the youth; the members of the churches will have to settle with the Master for their indifference and neglect of duty.",
