    "word": "We have a wonderful truth, and our zeal and earnestness should be proportionate to the great truths we profess to love. Make yourselves friends. David exclaimed, \"The zeal of Thine house has eaten me up\" (Psalm 69:9). \"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord\" (Psalm 84:2). Christ declared that it was His meat and drink to do His Father's will. The zeal that comes through such sanctification of the truth makes the believer in the truth powerful, for he is the repository of sacred truth, and as he partakes of the truth he will be a helpful Christian. Zeal should always be uniform, manifesting a holiness of character.",
