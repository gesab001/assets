    "word": "To everyone who is walking in the light, one who is not walking in the light will be an object of solicitude and most earnest prayer. But the Lord does not sanction anyone in presenting the attitude of a moral iceberg. It is not the spirit of Christ that leads men to wrap about themselves the garments of self-righteousness, and to say in spirit, \"I am holier than thou.\" Those who are free to denounce, to find fault, to judge and condemn others are not working upon Christlike principles. They should rather have travail of soul for those who need their help, to go forth and seek the wandering lost sheep.",
