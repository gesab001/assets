    "word": "Ministers should not neglect physical exercise. They should seek to make themselves useful, and be a help where they are dependent upon the hospitalities of others. They should not allow others to wait upon them, but rather lighten the burdens of those who have so great a respect for the gospel ministry that they would put themselves to great inconvenience in doing for them that which they should do for themselves. The poor health of some of our ministers is because of their neglect of physical exercise in useful labor.",
