    "word": "To those who are tired of a life of sinfulness, but who know not where to turn to obtain relief, present the compassionate Saviour, full of love and tenderness, longing to receive those who come to Him with broken hearts and contrite spirits. Take them by the hand, lift them up, speak to them words of hope and courage. Help them to grasp the hand of Him who has said, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\" Isaiah 27:5.",
