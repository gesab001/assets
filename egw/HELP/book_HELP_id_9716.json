    "word": "Every man will at the Judgment receive according to the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or evil. Our Saviour bids us, \"Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\" If we encounter difficulties, and in Christ's strength overcome them; if we meet enemies, and in Christ's strength put them to flight; if we accept responsibilities, and in Christ's strength discharge them faithfully, we are gaining a precious experience. We learn, as we could not otherwise have learned, that our Saviour is a present help in every time of need.",
