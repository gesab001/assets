    "word": "Brother Underwood, you had all the responsibilities you could carry before you became interested in this Mount Vernon matter. This additional care will not help you to take a course calculated to win the confidence of your brethren. It will not help you to keep calm nerves and an even temper to do the work the Lord has for you to do. If you are a disappointed man, you will be a very unhappy man. In order to be highly useful, you need more of the love of Christ to subdue your own will. You do not feel under sound obligation to God to be patient and kind and \n                                                                           246\nrespectful toward your ministering brethren and toward every member of the church. They lose confidence in you and then your influence is crippled. You need the kindness, courtesy, meekness, and lowliness of Christ. You have many valuable qualifications that can be perfected for highest service if sanctified to God. You should feel the necessity of approaching your brethren with kindness and courtesy, not with harshness and severity. You do not realize the harm you do by your sharp, domineering spirit toward them. The ministers in your conference become disheartened, losing the courage they might have if you would give them respect, kindness, confidence, and love. By your manner of dealing you have separated the hearts of your brethren from you, so that your counsel has not had much influence over them for good. This is not as the Lord would have it. He is not pleased with your attitude toward your brethren.",
