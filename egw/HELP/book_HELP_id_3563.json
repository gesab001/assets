    "word": "Will Break Down Prejudice \n\n     As the medical missionary cares for the sick, if he is well equipped with knowledge and with instruments for putting that knowledge into practice, he will surely break down prejudice.

In His service the Lord will open doors whereby His word can find entrance.",
