    "word": "Those who believe Bible truth for this time will consider that there are men to be educated to work for their own colored people as missionaries, and they are not to feel that their sphere of labor must be for the whites, for they are to be educated and trained [to] become missionaries in their own borders.

All who will conscientiously, in the fear of God, set about the work of education of the colored are to be encouraged and helped.",
