    "word": "God holds us responsible for all that we might be if we would improve our talents; and we shall be judged according to what we ought to have been but were not; what we might have done but did not accomplish, because we did not use our powers to glorify God. For all knowledge that we might have gained but did not, there will be an eternal loss, even if we do not lose our souls. All our influence belongs to God. All that we acquire is to be used to His glory. All the property that the Lord has entrusted to us is to be held on the altar of God, to be returned to Him again. We are working out our own destiny. May God help us all to be wise for eternity.--Letter 15, 1890, pp. 6, 7. (To Brother Irwin, August 12, 1890.) \n\nReleased June 21, 1978.",
