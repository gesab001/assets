    "word": "It will be difficult to overcome prejudice, and to convince the unbelieving that our efforts to help them are disinterested. But this should not hinder our labor. There is no precept in the word of God that tells us to do good to those only who appreciate and respond to our efforts, and to benefit those only who will thank us for it. God has sent us to work in his vineyard. It is our business to do all we can. \u201cIn the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that.\u201d [Ecclesiastes 11:6.] We have too little faith. We limit the Holy One of Israel. We should be grateful that God condescends to use any of us as his instruments. For every earnest prayer put up in faith for anything, answers will be returned. They may not come just as we have expected; but they will come\u2014not perhaps as we have desired, but at the very time when we most need them. But O, how sinful is our unbelief! \u201cIf ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\u201d [John 15:7.]",
