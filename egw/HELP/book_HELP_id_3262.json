    "word": "These possibilities of the future were outlined at length by Mrs. White in communications addressed to the leaders of the cause of God who were assembling in General Conference early in 1899. \"Our brethren have not discerned that in helping us,\" she wrote to them concerning the value of maintaining strong training centers for workers in Australasia, \"they would be helping themselves. That which is given to start the work here, will result in strengthening the work in other places. As your gifts free us from continual embarrassment, our labors can be extended; there will be an ingathering of souls, churches will be established, and there will be increasing financial strength. We shall have a sufficiency not only to carry on the work here, but to impart to other fields. Nothing is gained by withholding the very means that would enable us to work to advantage, extending the knowledge of God and the triumphs of truth in regions beyond.\" [THE DAILY BULLETIN OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE, 1899, P. 131.]",
