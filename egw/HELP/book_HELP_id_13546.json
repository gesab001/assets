    "word": "I plead with you, Elder Reaser, to take your stand wholly on the right side. We cannot change the presidency without feeling a deep regret. If you will take your position firmly to counterwork the influence you have exerted against the Testimonies of the Spirit of God, then the Lord can accept you. But while you remain in an unsettled condition, having more confidence in your own judgment than you have in the counsel of the Lord, you are doing a work to undermine the confidence of the people in the work of the Lord. I must say to you, Elder Reaser, that there is need for much searching of self, for you have much prejudice to overcome. One seed of unbelief sown in the heart, will change the atmosphere of the soul. There is a far-reaching work to be done in counterworking the work of unbelief that has been done. If you will place yourself under the control of the Spirit of God, the Lord will help you to do this. Angels of God are by the side of those who choose to be taught of the Lord and who seek His counsel. Our workers need to counsel often together, that they may know what spirit is controlling them.",
