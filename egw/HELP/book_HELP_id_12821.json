    "word": "As a people we must stand together, refusing to be coerced into signing contracts binding themselves about in order to be favored. God says, \"Stand bravely for the right; follow Bible principles; and I will be with you as your helper.\" But when God's people play the cowards as they did at the meeting concerning Lincoln College, they show that they fear man more than they fear God. When God is with a man, that man receives power from on high, and can guide and direct, but when a man is controlled by another spirit, his wisdom is to be regarded and treated as foolishness.",
