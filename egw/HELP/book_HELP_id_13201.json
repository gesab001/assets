Nov. 9, 1899. \n\nDear Brother Hyatt:- \n     I have some things to say to you which must be said. The first difficulties with brother Philip Wessels were created by the confusion that came into Battle Creek from the Minneapolis meeting. Two years of opposition were brought in and at two general conferences a spirit prevailed among some of our leading men which was not inspired by God. Here were Brother Philip Wessels and his brother who afterward came into the possession of much property. Had the influence of the leading men of Battle Creek been pure and holy, what an influence would have gone forth from them to help and strengthen and settle the Wessels family. But disunion and rejection of light were the prevailing sins of those who had been long in the faith. They stood in stubborn defiance of truth and light and evidence, and the crooked paths made by them had an influence to unsettle the confidence of the Wessels brothers.",
