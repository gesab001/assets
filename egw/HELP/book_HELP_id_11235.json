    "word": "The Lord works with those who are sinners. These are the ones who need most the help of the great Physician; yet, like the lost piece of silver, they are unconscious of their state. The soul unaroused is in a state of impiety, even at an early age. The woman who begins her search for the piece of silver sweeps the house until she finds it. She removes everything that will obstruct her search. She seeks diligently until she finds it. Then, rejoicing in her success, she calls her friends together, saying, \"Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost\" (Luke 15:9). In every home let the candle be lighted. Fathers and mothers must bring the Word of God into their practical life if they would save the souls of their children.",
