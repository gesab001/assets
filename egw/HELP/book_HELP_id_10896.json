    "word": "MR No. 653 - Marriage Considerations\n\n     One about to marry a wife should stop to consider candidly why he takes this step. Is his wife to be his helper, his companion, his equal, or will he pursue toward her such a course that she cannot have an eye single to the glory of God? Will he venture to give loose rein to his passions and see how much care and taxation he can subject his wife to without extinguishing life, or will he study the meaning of the words, \"Whatsoever ye do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus?\"--Ms 152, 1899, p. 1. (\"The Temple of God Must Be Holy,\" October 31, 1899.)",
