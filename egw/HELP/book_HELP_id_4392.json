    "word": "Entreat rather than rebuke ministers in error.--Follow the instruction of the Word of God, in dealing with your ministering brethren. Paul says, \"Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father, and the younger men as brethren.\" There may be occasion to speak of their errors to those who have long been in the ministry, but let it be done as a matter of entreaty, and not rebuke. The younger ministers are to be treated as brethren, and may God help us that we may help one another. We must have a living connection\n58\nwith God. We must be clothed with power from on high by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, that we may reach a higher standard; for there is help for us in no other way.--RH Apr. 5, 1892.",
