    "word": "(454)     B.-274-'07          Sanitarium, Calif., Sept. 2, 1907. \n\nDear Brother Burden:- \n     I received your letter, and read it with much interest. The work you speak of that has been done for the W.C.T.U. is in harmony with the work that, before the Loma Linda property came into our hands, I was shown must be entered into. A grand work is to be done by our people for the W.C.T.U. The Lord has in that association precious souls, who will accept the truth and become one with our labors. These workers will be a great help to us in our efforts in temperance lines. And the education of our people have had in Bible truth and in a knowledge of the requirements of the law of Jehovah, they will impart to those who come in among us. Thus a union and sympathy will be created where in the past prejudice has existed.",
