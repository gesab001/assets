    "word": "\"Christ's Object Lessons\" was given as much for the advancement of the educational work in the South as for any other part of the world. My brethren and sisters, do you not want to help the work in the South by selling this book? Let all do what they can to help the work now in need of help in the Southern field. Schools are needed there. The small schools that have been established for the colored people are in need of help. Let every one bring to the treasury something that will place the schools on vantage-ground.",
