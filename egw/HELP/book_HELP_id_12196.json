Your self-confidence would be very strong, and any words I might offer would be as seed sown upon the rock. The Lord did not want you to employ your God-given time, and set your talents to work, in wrong channels. Your work has not set you in that line at all. Neither you nor any of your brethren had any work to do in arguing or writing or taking any part whatever in politics. God was dishonored by all who acted any part in politics.",
