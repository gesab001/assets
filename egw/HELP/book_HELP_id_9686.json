    "word": "I hope you can be with us when W. C. White is here, which will be in about two weeks. Then you can see just how matters stand, and do your part to make everything right. This is your first duty, and may the Lord help you that you shall not have run in vain, neither labored in vain. You need to be strong in God, and in the power of his might, not strong in your own strength. It is time that you gave your brethren and sisters, and the world, an example of what a Christian minister should be, both in the pulpit and out of the pulpit. You are not safe unless you are daily learning meekness and lowliness of heart in the school of Christ. Every day we need the \n\n\n                            [59] \n\nconverting, transforming grace of Christ upon our souls. Every day we need the Comforter that Christ promised to send after he should ascend to his Father. He said, \"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you . . . But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever things I have said unto you.\"",
