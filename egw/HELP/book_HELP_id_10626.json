    "word": "MR No. 400 - Counsel to E. R. Palmer\n\n     In the past I have felt perplexed about saying to you all that I desired to say for I feared you would not understand me. . . . The Lord has given you a special and important gift, in your experience as a canvasser, and your ability to teach others how to engage successfully in this work. You are not to become discouraged when you find that many do not see in all points as you do, and that there is a diversity of plans. The Lord has not given you the responsibility of governing the work, but He has given you wisdom as a teacher, and He will help you to help others to learn how to carry the canvassing work forward to success.--Letter 92, 1903, pp. 1, 2. (To Brother Palmer, May 21, 1903.) \n\nReleased January 16, 1975.",
