    "word": "A Prayer of Penitence\n      (Found in a Letter to a Member of the Wessels Family) \n     The language of our hearts should be: \u201cO Lord, righteousness belongeth unto Thee, but unto us who have departed from Thy counsel confusion of faces.\u201d What answer can we render to Thee? and how shall we be justified before Thee? We will return unto Thee; for Thy hand is stretched forth to help the penitent, who seek Thee with the whole heart. For Thy mercy's sake, thou hearest their cries.",
