    "word": "Remember that you will never reach a higher standard than you yourselves set. Set your mark high, and then step by step, even though it be by painful effort, by self-denial and self-sacrifice, ascend the whole length of the ladder of progress. Let nothing hinder you. Christ will be to you a present help in every time of trouble. Stand like Daniel, the faithful statesman, a man whom no temptation could corrupt. Do not disappoint your parents and friends. And there is another to be considered. Do not disappoint Him who so loved you that He gave His own life to cancel your sins. He says: \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" Remember this, If you have made mistakes, you certainly gain a victory if you see these mistakes, and regard them as beacons of warning. I need not tell you that thus you turn defeat into victory, disappointing the enemy and honoring your Redeemer.",
