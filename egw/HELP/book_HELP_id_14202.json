    "word": "Many find this difficult, it may be because they did not receive their education at home. They did not sufficiently realize that they were a part of the family firm. They did not think it was their duty to bring all the help possible into the family, just as did our Saviour. They were not taught the importance of making the life of Christ their life, and the character of Christ their character. In many cases the natural inclination of the children has been left to flow at liberty. They have been allowed to neglect the little things which they should do without being told. They have not been taught to bear burdens and to contradict natural inclinations.",
