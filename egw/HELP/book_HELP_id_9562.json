    "word": "Let the work in the Southern field go forward. Let no one say, Money is not needed in this field. . . . Let God's people begin at once to redeem their neglect. Let the gospel message ring through our churches, summoning them to universal action. . . . A good work has been done, and it has been done in the face of the most trying circumstances. The Lord calls upon us to come up to His help in this needy field. [GENERAL CONFERENCE BULLETIN, VOL. V, PP. 204, 205.] \n                                                                           66",
