    "word": "As to putting the book Education into some such way of circulation as Object Lessons, I do not expect anything of the kind. Let this book have its course, but my books are not to pass through the many hands that they have done. I have protested against it for many years. The tract societies are not helping me, but are detracting from the profits I should have. I have not and will not consent to have any donations made for me. I will not consent for my care to come in as one bit of an item to make you rally to work for me. You have got all on your hands that you should have and can possibly have.",
