    "word": "Many mothers fail to realize the importance of this branch of knowledge, and rather than have the trouble and care of instructing their children and bearing with their failures and errors, they prefer to do all the cooking themselves. And when their daughters make mistakes in their efforts, they send them away with, \u201cIt is no use; you can't do this or that. You perplex and trouble me more than you help.\u201d Thus the first efforts of the learners are repulsed, and the failure so cools their interest and ardor to learn that they dread another trial, and will propose to knit, sew, clean house,\u2014anything but cook. Here the mother was greatly at fault. She should have patiently instructed them, that they might, by practice, acquire skill and efficiency.",
