    "word": "Again Christ says, \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me.\" We are students in the school of Christ, to learn our duty, and this involves a duty to diligently search the Scriptures. In them God, through His prophets, has given instruction as to how to secure eternal life. Shall we be indifferent to this instruction? To understand the truth will require effort on our part, but we can gain that necessary knowledge with the help of Christ. He has died for us, He appreciates all our efforts, and He ever stands ready to assist those who are striving to gain the necessary knowledge.",
