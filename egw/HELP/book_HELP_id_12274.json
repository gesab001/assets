    "word": "Men in positions of influence, men who have ventured to assume responsibility, are dealing with human minds in a manner wholly unlike the manner in which Jesus dealt with human minds. Their friendship does not profit but rather weakens and destroys. The manner in which they deal with the erring has been represented to me under this figure--they are like a man in a boat who sees another struggling in the waves for his life. The drowning man tries to grasp hold of the boat to save his life, but instead of reaching out a helping hand to the perishing to lift him into the boat, he reaches down to break the drowning man's grasp, and leaves him to perish in the dark hungry waters. This represents the course of many.",
