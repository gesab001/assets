    "word": "It is in harmony with this instruction, that meeting-houses have been purchased and rededicated in Washington and in Nashville, while the publishing-houses and the sanitariums at these centers have been established away from the congested heart of the cities, as outpost-centers.

We are now given opportunity to advance in the opening providences of God by helping our brethren in these and many other important centers to establish the work on a firm basis, in order that it may be carried forward solidly. The Lord is calling upon us to \"strengthen the hands of the builders\" in many parts of the world.",
