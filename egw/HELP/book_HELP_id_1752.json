    "word": "BUT LUCINDA DID NOT DESTROY THE LETTERS AS REQUESTED. THUS THEY CAME INTO THE POSSESSION OF THE WHITE ESTATE IN 1973. THE ESTATE, BEING UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE FOUR LETTERS, LAID THEM ASIDE, AND DID NOT PLACE THEM IN THE REGULAR FILE. SINCE THEN, SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE WHITE ESTATE SHOULD HAVE BURNED THE LETTERS, IN HARMONY WITH ELLEN WHITE'S ORIGINAL REQUEST. BUT OTHERS HAVE FELT THAT THE LETTERS SHOULD BE PRESERVED, FOR TWO REASONS: 1. THE SITUATION CONFRONTING THE WHITE ESTATE IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH FACED LUCINDA HALL. LUCINDA WAS THE ONE WHO WAS ASKED TO BURN THE LETTERS. SINCE SHE DID NOT, THE WHITE ESTATE BOARD MUST CONSIDER THE REQUEST IN THE LIGHT OF ITS OWN SITUATION. CRITICS MIGHT ACCUSE THE ESTATE OF DESTROYING NOT MERELY THESE LETTERS, BUT OTHER CORRESPONDENCE AND MANUSCRIPTS; (2) THE ACCOUNT OF HOW ELLEN WHITE RELATED TO AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TIME IN HER LIFE COULD BE OF HELP TO INDIVIDUALS FACING SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES TODAY.",
