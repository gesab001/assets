    "word": "Books for Hospitals, Nursing Homes, and Orphanages.-- Please find out what is needed in the patients' library, and purchase the necessary volumes at my expense, as I desire to make a gift of them to the Sanitarium. I would wish these books for the patients' library to be in the best binding. Also, find out whether there is a set of my books in the helpers' library. If not, please buy a set for it, too. The binding of this set need not be the most expensive. Use your judgment in regard to this matter.",
