    "word": "That we may be fruitful in every good work, and increase in the knowledge of God, we are \"strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness.\" Let the nurses consider these words. Those who care for the sick should not go about with long faces, condoling with those who are suffering. Cheer them with words of comfort, hope, and joyfulness. Tell them that in Jesus Christ they have a greater Physician than any one connected with the Sanitarium. Let them understand that you who give them treatment are only finite beings, but that you have a living connection with God, and are there to help them to co-operate with Him in combating disease. Tell them that this institution is an object of the prayers of God's people. Show that God has filled your hearts with sympathy and tenderness for every suffering individual who is here.",
