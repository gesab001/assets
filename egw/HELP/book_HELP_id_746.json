    "word": "How to Counteract Discouragement \n\n     The servants of the Lord must expect every kind of  discouragement. They will be tried, not only by the anger, \n                                                                           240\ncontempt, and cruelty of enemies, but by the indolence, inconsistency, lukewarmness, and treachery of friends and helpers . . . Even some who seem to desire the work of God to prosper, will yet weaken the hands of His servants by hearing, reporting, and half believing the slanders, boasts, and menaces of their adversaries. . . . Amid great discouragements, Nehemiah made God his trust; and here is our defense. A remembrance of what the Lord has done for us will prove a support in every danger. \"He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\" And \"if God be for us, who can be against us?\" However craftily the plots of Satan and his agents may be laid, God can detect them, and bring to naught all their counsels.--Southern Watchman, April 19, 1904.",
