    "word": "May the Lord help us to seek Him with the whole heart, that we may find Him. He will not be trifled with. Those who, though having opportunity to find the true path, presumptuously depart from it, will some day, when too late, realize their terrible mistake. Eternal life is for those only who continue to obey God. For them Christ has purchased salvation. \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name\" [John 1:12].",
