    "word": "July 12. We had, I think, a very profitable visit with Brother and Sister Hansen. The Lord is surely drawing him to the light. I have borne a plain testimony to him both by pen and voice, and I have trembled in my soul as to how he would receive it. He told me through Brother Olsen that when he first read my letters written to him from Basel he could see but little light in them; the second time he read them he could see more; and the third time he could see still more, and he could receive it all; but had he moved upon his first impression he would have cast them aside as setting forth his case in a strong light that was not true. He has invited us to visit him in his home on the island, which he occupies in the summer. I have promised to go. I wish to draw nigh to him and help him all I can. King Oscar has a building on this same island which we shall visit. There are many things of interest connected with it that are desirable to see. The royal family spend some time there in summer.",
