    "word": "We left this young man, with all his natural and acquired ability, to think, believe, and act before God conscientiously. We now see that this was the best course. He has continued to attend our meetings and has been turned out from the college. Now will be the time to help him to help himself. This move of the officials in the college has affected other youth. Two young men of the same college have come to our meetings on the Sabbath. They became interested through reading the papers. They have been looking into the reasons of our faith, and although in a school called \"The Theological College,\" having a name to fit men to engage in the holy office of opening the Word of God to the people, our brethren state that they were astonished at such gross ignorance of Bible subjects, both in doctrines and the practical lessons of Christ. These young men have requested repeated interviews, which have been granted to them.",
