    "word": "We left Stanmore with all our luggage. Sister Peck was with us. We went a few stations beyond and had to go through the process of changing cars, but we missed the train and had to return to Stanmore. That night I spoke again under the tent, and the Lord helped me and blessed me. I spoke upon faith, and many souls said they were helped. I slept a few hours that night and next morning we made connections. We had a compartment all to ourselves, and I lay down like a tired child and slept until within a few miles of Cooranbong. I have spoken twice on Sabbath in our new chapel here. Sabbath was quite warm, and I suppose from what I know of America that February 5 was not very warm where you are.",
