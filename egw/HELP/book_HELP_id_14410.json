    "word": "In the common schools some things are taught that are a hindrance rather than a blessing. We need schools where the work of God is made the basis of education. The Madison Training School for teachers should have the hearty support of God's people. Therefore I ask you and your associates on the conference committee to act liberally in helping our brethren in Madison in this important work. \n                                (Signed) Ellen G.
