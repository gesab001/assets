    "word": "I am writing this to the parents among us because I greatly desire them to learn, and to teach to their children, the beautiful lessons that we must learn on earth before we can enter heaven. In everything you do ask yourselves, \"How will this help my children to prepare for the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for those who love Him?\" When the work in the home school is done as it should be, families will bring into the church such a noble unselfishness that heavenly angels will love to linger there. . . . Hearts will be refined and purified, made fit for the indwelling of the Lord Jesus.",
