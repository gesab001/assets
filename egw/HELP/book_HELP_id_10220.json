    "word": "Be watchful, be prayerful. Satan never sleeps. Be careful lest he gain advantage over you in your words or acts. Let the theme of your conversation be upon Bible subjects. Read your Bible much. Love the dear Saviour with all your heart and be daily learning in the school of Christ. Be guarded, not to speak hastily. You can know for yourself that your ways please God. Try to help Johnny. We want Johnny to be a humble, sincere Christian, walking in the footsteps of his dear father, traveling the path which leads to holiness.",
