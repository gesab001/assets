    "word": "My heart yearns to see you stand in the strength of the Mighty One. Will you, oh, will you take God at His word? Will you believe He means just what He says? I pray that your whole spirit and soul and body may be sanctified. Lie low at His feet, at the foot of the cross, subdued, broken, but taking hold of His strength, that is all that you need. I tell you, we must work in greater faith, we must fight the good fight of faith, we must break the force of Satan's suggestions, by living, actual faith. God has said it, and it will be done. His word is pledged, that He will be to you a present help in every time of need. Be strong in the Lord, yea, be strong.",
