    "word": "When I understood how the matter was, I had not a single question about the matter in my mind. I tell you, brethren, that in the place of withholding, you ought to give more liberally, for fields are opening everywhere. Souls are coming into the truth, and many of them never heard a discourse. \n\n\n                                    -166- \n\nI wish you could hear the pitiful appeals they are making to me.
