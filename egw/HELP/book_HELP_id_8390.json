    "word": "Not to Be Weary in Well-doing.--Many times our efforts for others may be disregarded and apparently lost. But this should be no excuse for us to become weary in well-doing. How often  has Jesus come to find fruit upon the plants of His care, and found nothing but leaves! We may be disappointed as to the result of our best efforts, but this should not lead us to be indifferent to others' woes and to do nothing. \"Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.\"--Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 525.",
