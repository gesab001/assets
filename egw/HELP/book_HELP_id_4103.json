    "word": "We have in our ranks too many who are restless, talkative, self-commending, and who take the liberty to put themselves forward, having no reverence for age, experience, or office.

Persons of this character do not think it detracts from their dignity to rise up before the ancient and to treat gray hairs with respect. . . .",
