    "word": "Three nights before the Review office burned, I was in an agony that words cannot describe. I could not sleep. I walked the room, praying to God to have mercy upon His people. Then I seemed to be in the Review office, with the men who have the management of the institution. I was trying to speak to them and thus to help them.

But the word of God forbids many of the things that you propose to do.\" At His first advent, Christ cleansed the temple. Prior to His second advent, He will again cleanse the temple. Why? Because commercial work has been brought in, and God has been forgotten. With hurry here and hurry there somewhere else, there was no time to think of heaven. The principles of God's law were presented, and I heard the question asked, \"How much of the law have you obeyed?\" Then the word was spoken, \"God will cleanse and purify His temple in His displeasure.\"",
