    "word": "I have dwelt upon this matter because this is a decided defect in your character.  The Lord has not been glorified by your laxness in dress.  It may seem to be but a small matter, but it is against the honor and glory of God. Men and women who are rich in grace and the influence of holiness will be circumspect in every matter that helps to give them influence.

We are nearing the close of time, and we must do all in our power to win souls for Christ's kingdom.  -- Letter 336, 1908.",
