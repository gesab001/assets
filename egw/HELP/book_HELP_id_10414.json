    "word": "I will say to my brethren in South Africa, There has not been that wisdom and keen foresight used in dealing with the Wessels family that there should have been. . . . True, they have not been free from mistakes and errors, but others, who have had much greater light, have revealed that they also erred. Have you given these brethren encouragement and wise, judicious \n\n\n                                       -396- \n\nhelp, or have you closed every avenue whereby they might be helped to be laborers together with God? Have you left them to drift whichever way they would? . . . Have you not crowded out their influence, that they might have no part or lot with you? Much more might have been done than has been done to bind them up with the work. . . . Lines of work could have been entered into that would have called the young men of the Wessels family to act a part in God's cause. Then they would not have drifted away into the world. . . .",
