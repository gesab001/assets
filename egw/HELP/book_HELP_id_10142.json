    "word": "The Lord is not pleased with the forbidding attitude that many have maintained toward the children in the Hobart church. They seem to have forgotten that children are the heritage of the Lord. They seem to have forgotten the words and the example of Christ, who took little children in His arms and blessed them. We should help and encourage those who are mothers of children by praying with and for them, for they are often in need of encouragement.",
