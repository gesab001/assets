But Edson, I hope you will not . . . let money, which is so important an item, slip through your hands without due and deliberate consideration. Live as plainly as we have taught and do not on any account become loose in regard to the principles of health reform. I need not tell you, Edson, that I have a thousand fears in regard to you. . . . Willie has been a great help to me. He is good and true, the best boy I ever knew.--Letter 4, 1866, pp. 1, 3. (To J. E. White, Sept. 22, 1866.)",
