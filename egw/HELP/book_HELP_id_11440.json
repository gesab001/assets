    "word": "I spoke Sabbath afternoon, and I speak to the youth tonight. May the divine aid be given me that the words spoken may not fall as water upon the rock. We need burden-bearers in every church--fathers and mothers who have a burden of prayer for their children, who will not cease their importunate entreaties until help and grace and salvation come to their children. God \n\n\n                              -401- \n\nlives and reigns. He will hear the humble prayers coming from contrite hearts. What we need in every church is more praying, more believing, less talking doubts, less grumbling, less murmuring, and a great deal more hope, courage, and perseverance. May God give us these things, for we are helpless without them.",
