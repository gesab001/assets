    "word": "This is applicable to many in our day. Light, clear, gospel light, has been given, but many of those occupying the highest positions of trust in connection with the work of God have not received the heaven-sent message. Having taken the place of instructors, they are not willing to humble themselves, and occupy the place of learners. There are too many today who are merely human moralists. A new element needs to be brought into their work. God's people must receive the warning, must listen to his commands, and go and labor for souls right where they are; for the people do not realize their peril and their great need of help.",
