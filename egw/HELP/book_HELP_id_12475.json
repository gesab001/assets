    "word": "I seemed to be taken away from myself, and to be in the presence of God. The question was, \"What have you done with the request of Fannie Bolton? You have been sorely tried, but your Saviour has been wounded and bruised and put to open shame by this deceived, deluded child. It is My will that you bear with her, forgive her, and help her. If she goes from you, Satan's net is spread for her feet. You alone can help her. She sympathizes with herself and will have those who do not walk in the light to view her case in a perverted light, to sympathize with her. And her own soul will be lost, and through her influence other souls will be deceived and lost. It is My will that you accede to her request. You are not to wait for an assurance of transformation of character. She does not have power to discern her own heart and the wily workings of the enemy. If she says she repents, if she reaches up her voice to you for help, My Spirit shall be with you.\"",
