    "word": "Importance of Bible Study. If medical students will study the word of God diligently they will be far better prepared to understand their other studies; for enlightenment always comes from an earnest study of the word of (768) God. Nothing will so help to give a retentive memory as a study of the Scriptures. Let our medical missionary workers understand that the more they become acquainted with God and with Christ, and the more they become acquainted with Bible history, the better prepared will they be to do their work.",
