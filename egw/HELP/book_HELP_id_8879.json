    "word": "Righteous, high-principled, God-fearing men will stand before him as capable of receiving his orders and of executing them with exactitude. The work of such men will bear the similitude of heaven. They will choose as their counselors and helpers only the good and faithful. Our God is a jealous God, and those who fear him, who live as if in his presence, as they surely are, will choose as counselors those who are pure and righteous, who understand the will of God, and who refuse to uphold unrighteousness or selfishness in themselves or in any one else, who will not oppress their fellow-men because they have it in their power to build up or to tear down, but who treat the humble as God treats them, showing them favor. When the heart is purified, refined by the Spirit of God, there will be fewer judgments pronounced upon others, and far more meekness and lowliness will be revealed.",
