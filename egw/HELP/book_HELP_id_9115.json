    "word": "In ministry to the poor there is a wide field of service for women as well as for men. The efficient cook, the housekeeper, the seamstress, the nurse,--the help of all is needed. Let the members of poor households be taught how to cook how to make and mend their own clothing, how to nurse the sick, how to properly care for the home. Let boys and girls be thoroughly taught some useful trade or occupation. M. H. 194.",
