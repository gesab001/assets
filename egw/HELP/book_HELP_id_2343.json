    "word": "Like a roaring lion, Satan is seeking for his prey. He tries his wiles upon every unsuspecting youth; there is safety only in Christ. It is through His grace alone that Satan can be successfully repulsed. Satan tells the young that there is time enough yet, that they may indulge in sin and vice this once and never again; but that one indulgence will poison their whole life. Do not once venture on forbidden ground. In this perilous day of evil, when allurements to vice and corruption are on every hand, let the earnest, heartfelt cry of the young be raised to heaven: \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?\" And may his ears be open and his heart inclined to obey the instruction given in the answer: \"By taking heed thereto according to thy word\" (Psalm 119:9). The only safety for the youth in this age of pollution is to make God their trust. Without divine help they will be unable to control human passions and appetites. In Christ is the very help needed. . . . You can say with the apostle: \"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us\" (Romans 8:37). Again; \"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection\" (1 Corinthians 9:27).",
