    "word": "Will those who shall read these words consider that they are to undertake good works, trusting wholly in Jesus Christ for His grace and sufficiency? You have the pledged word of God that He will be a present help in every time of need. Place all your moral and physical powers under the control of the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus, who gave His own life for you, will quicken your perceptions, as He has promised, in giving you the Comforter. The light will shine into your hearts, and you will be true soldiers in the army of the Lord.",
