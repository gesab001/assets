    "word": "June 18, 1892. The past night was one of great suffering. During the evening I had a coke fire in the grate. I awoke with a sense of suffocation and pressure for breath. I called for help. By mistake all the windows in my room had been left closed. I felt sick all over and very faint, and for a time I lost all sense of things about me. At last May Walling and Emily Campbell came to my help, and every effort was made to give me ease. But I was not entirely relieved for some time.",
