    "word": "God is a very present help in time of need. If you will put your trust in Him, He will make His goodness pass before you; He will lead you by His counsel. His Holy Spirit, His providences, the teachings of His word--all will be agencies in instructing you and leading you in the way of the Lord. God's promise to you is, \"I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee\" (Hebrews 13:5). Therefore you may say with humility, yet with firm confidence, \"This God is my God forever and ever.\"",
