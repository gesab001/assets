    "word": "We are living in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, and our nice and exact plans cannot always be carried out to the advantage of all. If we stand back upon our dignity, we shall fail to help those who need help the most. The servants of Christ should accommodate themselves to the varied conditions of the people. They cannot carry out exact rules, if they meet the cases of all. Labor will have to be varied to meet the people where they are. \u201cOf some have compassion, making a difference; and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.\u201d [Jude 22, 23.]",
