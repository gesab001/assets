    "word": "There are missions that must be supported. I remember when I was in Switzerland, how oppressed they were for want of means. Ask a man how much he is receiving for his labor, and he says $150 a year. He had five in his family and labored for that amount. Now, that man was pressed for the necessaries of life. You would think you were starving if you were living on that much. You do not know how it is. I know how it is. It will do you good to tell you. One-half of the world do not know how the other half is living. While you have the comforts of life, you ought to do God's will in helping others.",
