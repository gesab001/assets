    "word": "Christ was misunderstood by His brothers; for He was not like them. He worked to relieve every case of suffering that He saw, and He was always successful. He had little money to give, but He often gave His own humble food to those whom He thought more needy than Himself. His brothers felt that His influence went far to counteract theirs; for when they spoke harshly to poor, degraded souls with whom they came in contact, Christ sought these very ones, and spoke words of encouragement to them. If when in the family circle, He could do no more, He would as quietly and secretly as possible, give the wretched beings He was trying to help, the cup of cold water, and then place His own meal in their hands.--Manuscript 22, Feb. 20, 1898, \"Christ, the Great Missionary.\"",
