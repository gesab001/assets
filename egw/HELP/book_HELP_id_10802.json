    "word": "MR No. 531 - Letter to Lucinda Hall\n\n     It is five o'clock. I improve this opportunity while the yet nameless one is asleep. (Send him a name.) He needs much attention. Never did I miss you as now. We have had Addie Jones to help us but I should wish to be delivered from such help. She is just good for nothing; shall not keep her after this week. I employed her that Jenny might be released to take care of me and tend the baby; but instead of that Jenny did the washing and I was left without help until about four o'clock, and felt almost crazy with weakness. I told her to tell Jenny I must have help. She said to her, \"Sister White says she will want you this afternoon.\" That night I could not sleep and Monday was very weak and could not sleep Monday night.",
