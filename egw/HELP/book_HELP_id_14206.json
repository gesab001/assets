    "word": "We are in danger of spreading over more territory and starting more enterprises when we can possibly attend to properly. There is danger of our overdoing some branches of the work, and leaving some important parts of it to be neglected. To undertake a large amount of work and do nothing perfectly, would be a bad plan. We are to move forward, but must not be so far above the simplicity of the work that it will be impossible to look after the enterprise entered into without sacrificing our best helpers to keep things in order. Life and health must be regarded. While we should ever be ready to follow the opening providence of God, we should lay no larger plans, nor occupy more ground than there are help and means to bind off and work well, keep up and increase the interest already started. While there are broader plans and fields constantly opening for the laborers, our ideas and views must broaden in regard to the workers who are to labor to bring souls into the truth.\" \n\n\n                                              E.
