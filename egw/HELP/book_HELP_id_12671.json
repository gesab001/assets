    "word": "There was a desire on the part of the officers [magistrates] that Paul and Silas should quietly leave the jail; but Paul says No, you have scourged us, and though uncondemned you have imprisoned us; now take us out yourselves. That God lives today who wrought for Paul and Silas. May God help us to establish the fear of God in our homes. God help us that we may make straight paths for our feet. May God help us to help one another, and the Lord of Hosts will be with us and give us victory.--Ms 26, 1894 (MR 900.67).",
