    "word": "My brethren and sisters, I ask you to remember that money is needed to advance the work at the Glendale Sanitarium. Do you wish to act a part in the important work that the Lord has given you to do in that institution? Will you now do your best to help us to secure the necessary facilities for the advancement of that work? Intelligent, self-denying, self-sacrificing effort is now needed,--effort put forth by those who realize the importance of the Lord's work. The medical missionary work given us to do means much to every one of us. It is a work for soul-saving. Christian philanthropists should step forward just now to fulfil the gospel commission.",
