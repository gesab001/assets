    "word": "Those who have so many battles to fight must be strong for service. Gain strength and help from the Source of all power. If we trust in the Lord, we shall triumph in the warfare against unseen foes, but if we trust in our own strength, we shall surely meet with defeat. The armor is prepared. Put it on, and fight bravely for the Lord.--Letter 67, April 25, 1902, \"To My Brethren in Positions of Responsibility in the Pacific Press.\"",
