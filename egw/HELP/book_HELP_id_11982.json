    "word": "Look at the state of things as it exists today. How little thought of God or heaven there is among the people. Entire families are brought up with no knowledge of God. And your children that God has given you, what are you doing for them? Are you bringing them up in the fear of the Lord? These little children can be educated from their very babyhood to love and honor God; and if you train them in this way, then you will see that God is helping you in your feebleness. In the morning you want to teach your children that God is your trust. Teach them that they are living for the future immortal life, and not for this world. You want to bring God into your house and family. You want to feel that not one impatient word will be uttered in your family. You want to carry an influence that is heavenly, and act as though you believed that Christ is coming. Many act as though riches were indispensable. Why, riches cannot save your soul. Looks cannot save your soul. It is a humble confession of all your sins that will bring you into favor with your heavenly Father.",
