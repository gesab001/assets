    "word": "Saturday, January 11, 1873:--We rested well last night. This Sabbath morning opens cloudy. My mind is coming to strange conclusions. I am thinking I must lay aside my writing I have taken so much pleasure in, and see if I cannot become a scholar. I am not a grammarian. I will try, if the Lord will help me, at forty-five years old to become a scholar in the science. God will help me. I believe He will.--Ms 3, 1873, p. 5. (Diary, January 1 to 31, 1873.)",
