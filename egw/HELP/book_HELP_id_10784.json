    "word": "We desire to see the healing power of God in this sanitarium. Let those who are sick have hope and courage to bring their cases to the Master. The angels of God are here. While the physicians and the helpers are doing everything they can on your behalf, Christ Himself is the Healer of your diseases. He it is who combats the disease you have brought on yourself by an imprudent, sinful course of action. He, the Sin-bearer, is the only One who \n\n\n                                    -377- \n\ncan successfully combat disease. Oh, link up with the Great Physician! He is ready to place His everlasting arms underneath you.--Ms 102, 1901, p. 14. (Sermon, September 21, 1901.)",
