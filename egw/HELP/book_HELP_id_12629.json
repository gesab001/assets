    "word": "In spite of our errors, our continual backsliding, the voice of the long-suffering Saviour is heard inviting us, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" To the needy, the fainting, those who are weighed down with burden and care and \n\n\n                 -2- \n\nperplexity, the invitation is, \"Come.\" It is Christ's glory to encircle us in the arms of His mercy and love, and bind up our wounds, to sympathize with those who need sympathy, and strengthen those who need strength. When we have been almost ready to sink, we have sent up the earnest cry, \"Lord, save, or I perish,\" and how sweet it has been to find His hand stretched out to save. He has been to us just what He promised, a present help in every time of need.",
