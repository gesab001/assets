    "word": "Let the leading men in the General Conference and the presidents of our state conferences go to those who have been under temptation, and try to help them. Talk with Brethren Paulson and Sadler, and help them to press the Battle to the gates. Talk with them alone, and do all in your power to disabuse their minds. We see with what determined effort Satan is working, and we are to labor with heart and mind and soul and strength to win others to Christ.",
