    "word": "Many years ago, while my husband was still alive, we visited St. Helena, and helped to select the piece of land on which this sanitarium has been built. As my husband looked over the valley, he said, \"Wife, if we ever have an institution here, we will build a house where from every window we can look upon the beautiful scenery \n\n\n               -258- \n\nthat is all around us.\" Ever since that time, I have looked upon this place with great delight. Those who come here may be benefited, and greatly blessed by the Lord, if they will cooperate with Him. True, you will feel keenly, at first, the deprivation that comes with the putting away of injurious habits; but reformation will result in restoration of health. I would choose health in preference to indulgence of appetite.",
