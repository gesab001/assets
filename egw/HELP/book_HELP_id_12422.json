    "word": "Tuesday, December 22, 1885, Basel, Switzerland, Ellen White to Edson & W.C. White \n\n\n     Dear Children, Edson and Willie: . . . Tell her [Marian Davis] [MARIAN DAVIS (1847-1904) WAS A HIGHLY SKILLED SECRETARY AND LITERARY ASSISTANT TO ELLEN WHITE. SHE WORKED FOR ELLEN WHITE FROM 1879 UNTIL 1904, HELPING TO PRODUCE MANY BOOKS, INCLUDING THE DESIRE OF AGES.] I just one minute ago read the letters in which she has specified the improvements to be made in articles for Volume 1. I thank her. Tell her that she has a point about Zedekiah's having his eyes put out. That needs to be more carefully worded--also the rock, when the water flowed--something in reference to this. I think I can make the articles specified more full. . . .",
