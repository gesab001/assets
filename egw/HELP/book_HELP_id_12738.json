    "word": "Students, try to make the most of yourselves. Christ has paid an infinite price for you, and you cannot afford to disappoint Him by neglecting to avail yourselves of the opportunities for self-improvement presented to you. Cultivate a spirit that is calm, kind, gentle, tender. By doing this you can learn so much the more rapidly, because you are not troubled over something that somebody has said in regard to you. When we come into a position where we can help one another, we shall have the satisfaction of knowing that we have done our best.",
