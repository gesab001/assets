    "word": "I do not feel that any evidence presented to these men will have the least effect upon them. In McCullagh's case, no new evidence can be given as to the truthfulness of the mission and work the Lord has given His servant to do. He has had the light. This apostasy has been permitted, that it may be faithfully written out in the true light, that the church at Adelaide may be helped to plant their feet upon the Rock of Ages and not on shifting sand. And this experience is to be a warning to others. Those who could ignore all the evidences God had given them in the recent camp meeting, and change that blessing into a curse, should tremble for the safety of their own souls. Their candlestick will be removed out of its place unless they repent. The Lord has been insulted. The standard of truth of the first, second, and third angels' messages has been left to trail in the dust. If the watchmen are left to mislead the people in this fashion, God will hold some souls responsible for a lack of keen discernment to discover what kind of provender was being given to His flock.",
