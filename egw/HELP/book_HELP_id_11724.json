    "word": "The Lord has been pleased to present this matter before me in clear lines. Fever cases need not be treated with drugs.

The Lord will bless the physician who depends on natural methods, helping every function of the human machinery to act in its own strength the part the Lord designed it to act in restoring itself to proper action.",
