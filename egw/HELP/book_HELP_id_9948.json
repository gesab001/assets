    "word": "We should study the life of Christ, as recorded in the Bible, and seek to follow His methods of labor. If we follow our human plans, we shall hinder instead of help the work. \"He that is not with Me,\" said Christ,\"is against Me, and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\" Our will must be in subjection to the divine will. Our ways must be patterned after Christ's ways. Ms. 57, 1903, p. 1. (\"An Appeal for Consecration and Service,\" n. d.)",
