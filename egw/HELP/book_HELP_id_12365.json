    "word": "God help you, strengthen and comfort you, is my prayer. Look up always. Jesus is a risen Saviour. He is not in Joseph's tomb with a great stone rolled before the door. We have a living, risen Christ, who stands at the head of His church. I hope our people will hang their helpless souls upon God. He can bear your weight. He can carry all your burdens.",
