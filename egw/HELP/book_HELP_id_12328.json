    "word": "A letter came to me last night from Elder Haskell stating that the land, a beautiful spot, is now secured. I do not know the price, but I think they offered it cheaper than any we had yet looked at. Now the process of building goes forward. In eight days we leave here for Melbourne to spend some weeks there speaking to the people under the tent. And now I again invite you to help us and be my agent to get what help you can from others. In much love to you, my sister, Brother Zelinsky, and Sister Ings.--Letter 8, 1898. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nFebruary 28, 1991. Entire Letter.",
