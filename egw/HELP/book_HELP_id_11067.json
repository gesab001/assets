    "word": "I send these few words to you regarding Stephen Belden in Norfolk Island. He was sustained there by the Conference. I thought it best for him to be near us in Sunnyside and therefore was at the expense to have him leave his island home. After a time Elder Nobbs urged him so persistently to come back to the island, stating that they needed him there as a counselor and as one who could enlighten them in many ways and act a part in their meetings. I read these letters and finally gave my consent, saying that I would see that the New South Wales Conference would help him to about two or three dollars per week. I think it should be three at least. Brother Nobbs is now sick and upon Stephen Belden falls the burden of holding the fort until there can be some man sent.",
