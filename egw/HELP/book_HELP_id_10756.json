    "word": "In the long history presented before me, I can see the dangerous path that you have been traveling. You have boasted of your study of science. But from the light that God has given me, I know that you might better, far better, have become a fool in the eyes of the world, than to accept such science as you cherish, and use it as you have done,--to blind the mind and the judgment of those who were connected with you. Your scientific knowledge has been used by you to help you in acting a part similar to the part that Satan acted in the heavenly courts. Step by step you have been wandering away from God, working out plans instigated by the arch deceiver.--Letter 319, 1905, pp. 2, 3. (To J. H. Kellogg, June 2, 1905.)",
