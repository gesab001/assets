    "word": "There are many who err, and who feel their shame and their folly. They look upon their mistakes and errors until they are driven almost to desperation. These souls we are not to neglect.

Let a helping hand then be held out . . . as was the Elder Brother\u2019s hand to the sinking Peter. Speak hopeful words, words that will establish confidence and awaken love.",
