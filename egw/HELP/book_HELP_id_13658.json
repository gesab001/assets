    "word": "Arise, Shine \n\n     Let those who have a knowledge of the truth arise and shine. \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet.\" No longer mutilate the truth. Let the soul cry out for the living God. Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils. The Comforter will come to you, if you will open the door to Him. \"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in every time of need.\"--MS. 51, 1901. \n\n                                               -",
