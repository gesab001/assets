    "word": "MR No. 468 - Early Childhood Education\n\n     Special light has been given me in regards to why we may accomplish much more for the master by the establishment of many small sanitariums, than by the building up of a few large institutions. In these large medical institutions there will be gathered together many who are not very sick, but who, like tourists, are seeking rest and pleasure. These will have to be waited on by our nurses and helpers. Young men and young women who from their earliest years have been shielded from evil associations, are thus brought into contact with all classes of worldlings, and are influenced to a greater or less extent by what they see and hear. Many become like those with whom they associate, losing the simplicity and the modesty that Christian fathers and mothers have guarded and cherished by careful instruction and honest prayer.--Letter 244, 1903, pp. 1, 2. (To \"Sanitarium Managers and to Parents,\" typed November 5, 1903.)",
