    "word": "Monday, January 27, 1868. Arose at four o'clock. Left the comfortable home of Brother Root about five o'clock. . . . Rode five miles to Brother Buck's. Ate our breakfast with them. Brother Buck gave each of us a five-dollar bill. We thank him for his liberal gift. . . . Made no further stop until we passed through Greenville. Received our mail and passed on to our home. Found no help. Prepared our own dinner. We felt glad to find Willie \n\n\n                                     -150- \n\nnot sick. We left him with bad cold. Brother Corliss had taken good care of everything, and we prize him much.",
