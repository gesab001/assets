    "word": "April 7.--The precious subjects open to my mind well. I trust in God and He helps me to write. I am some twenty-four pages ahead of Mary. she does well with my copy. It will take a clear sense of duty to call me from this work to camp meetings. I mean to finish my writings on one book, at any rate, before I go anywhere. . . . The East will not see me for one year unless I feel that God calls me to go. He has given me my work. I will do it, if I can be left free.--Letter 4, 1876.",
