    "word": "Well, here I am sick in bed with malaria and rheumatism which first attacked the heart and has now spread over my entire body. I do not feel any burden of my own case. I am too thoroughly sick to try to get up my will power or to present my case to God in faith. I simply do not care. I long for rest. I have wrestled for the victory until I have fallen wounded and bruised and crippled, not by the weapons of the enemy, but those of my own brethren. Perhaps some think, Well, if Sister White was really doing the work of the Lord He would have sustained her. But if they would look, a little and reason from cause to effect, they would feel the rebuke of God upon them for joining the enemy's efforts, stirred from a power from beneath. They did the very work Satan wanted them to do; now let me rest. I have no burden of anxiety to recover. I am a suffering invalid. Just let me be. If I receive strength I will try and do something here in California. But I do hope you will visit California yourself. I hope that you will see that there must be a different set of gifts brought in here, and I hope it will not be long before we shall see help coming. \n\n\n                                       (Signed) Ellen G.
