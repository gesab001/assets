    "word": "Will we come down from our position of self-righteousness, and as little children take hold of God's work? Will we be willing to be taught and led of Him? With tottering steps we are just beginning to walk. In time we shall learn to take firmer steps, but now we are liable at any moment to stumble and fall. From the highest to the lowest, we each have spiritual weaknesses and troubles similar to the weaknesses and troubles of helpless children. And as these experienced children cannot place their dependence upon one another, but must depend on their parents, so we must learn not to hang our helpless souls on any human being, but cling to the One mighty to save. Man's policy is valueless. We must individually depend upon God for strength and guidance.",
