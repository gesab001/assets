    "word": "The Christian pilgrim cannot be sour, gloomy, depressed. It is a misrepresentation of the Christian faith to be surly, unreasonable, or sour in spirit. My brethren and sisters, no longer cherish such a spirit. Heed the apostle's admonition to provoke one another unto love and good works. How can you do this?--By conscientious, consistent behavior. Occasionally pause to sum up the results of such a course, to ascertain whether it is the wisest course to pursue. You will find that careful regard for one another's needs, kindly words of sympathy, and thoughtful assistance in helping others in their work, encourages not only them, but yourselves as well, because you thus become laborers together with God.",
