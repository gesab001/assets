    "word": "The Work in All Lands. \n\n     The work for the relief of our schools should be taken up by our people in all countries. Let it be entered upon by our churches in Australasia. Our school there is in need of help, and if our people will take hold of the work unitedly, they can do much toward lifting the burden of debt; they can encourage the hearts of those who are laboring to build up this, the Lord's instrumentality, and they can aid in extending its influence of blessing to far heathen lands and to the islands of the sea.",
