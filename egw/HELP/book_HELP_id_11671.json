    "word": "My heart is stirred within me. I want to say to the dressmaker who has taken her position, I will help you to go to Battle Creek and learn all you can, and see if some way will not open for her. One is a school teacher. She is not in the best of health and may have to leave her school. Another is an artist and has an excellent situation in the city, and can keep the Sabbath. If I had money, I know what I would do--I would help young men and women of talent to qualify them to become workers in the cause of God. But my hands are bound. I can do nothing, and this grieves me to the heart. This is a hard place for those who want to keep the Sabbath.",
