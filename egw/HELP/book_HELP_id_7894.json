    "word": "In the work of applying ourselves to help others, we may gain most precious victories. We must devote ourselves with untiring zeal, with earnest fidelity, with self-denial and with patience to the work of encouraging those who need to develop. Kind, encouraging words will do wonders. There are many who, if a constant, cheerful effort is put forth in their behalf, without faultfinding or continual chiding, will show themselves susceptible of improvement. . . .",
