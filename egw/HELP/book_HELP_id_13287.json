    "word": "July 13, 1900 \n\nMy dear Brethren, \n\n\n     I wish you to understand me correctly. The Lord has given special light that you must not pattern after Dr. Kellogg in doing the line of work that he is doing; for God has not given you that work to do. Neither has he given to Dr. Kellogg the work in which he has spent much time and money, to the robbery of fields that were destitute of means and destitute of helpers. He is bringing in an accumulating burden, by which he is creating not producing, but consuming. God has not called upon us to use the treasures of His house thus, to set His money flowing in streams which call forth such an outlay of time, money and workers. \n\n\n                                   - 44 -",
