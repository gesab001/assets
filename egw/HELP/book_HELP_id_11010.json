    "word": "MR No. 763 - Ellen White and the Church in Adelaide, South Australia\n\n     We are now to spend two or three months in Adelaide, seven hundred miles from here. The climate is excellent there and the church needs help. In Australia, it is the next largest church to Melbourne. Elder [A. G.] Daniells is on the ground now. He has been trying to find a suitable house for us to set up housekeeping there, and help him in a series of meetings. His health is not good at the present time, and we dare not have him take the whole labor upon himself. We go to Adelaide next Monday.--Letter 54, 1892, p. 1. (To J. E. White, September 22, 1892.)",
