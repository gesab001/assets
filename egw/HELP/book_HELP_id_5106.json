    "word": "Brother L should move more cautiously.  Men who are not of our faith obtain means of him upon various pretenses.  He trusts them, believing them to be honest. It will be impossible for him to get back all the means he has let slip out of his hands into the enemy's ranks.  He could make a safe investment of his means by aiding the cause of God, and thus laying up for himself treasures in heaven.  Frequently he is unable to help when he would, because he is crippled, and cannot command the means to do so.  When the Lord calls for his means, it is frequently in the hands of those to whom he has lent it, some of whom never design to pay, and others feel no anxiety in the matter.",
