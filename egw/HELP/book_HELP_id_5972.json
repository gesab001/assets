    "word": "The animals exposed to the tempest rushed toward man, choosing the society of human beings, as though expecting help of them. \n                                                                           72\nSome of the people would bind their children and themselves upon powerful beasts knowing that they would be tenacious for life; and would climb the highest points to escape the rising water. The storm does not abate its fury--the waters increase faster than at first. Some fasten themselves to lofty trees upon the highest points of land, but these trees are torn up by the roots, and carried with violence through the air, and appear as though angrily hurled, with stones and earth, into the swelling, boiling billows. Upon the loftiest heights human beings and beasts would strive to hold their position until all were hurled together into the foaming waters which nearly reached the highest points of land. The loftiest highs are at length reached, and man and beast alike perish by the waters of the flood.",
