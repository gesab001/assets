    "word": "You may be teachers in more ways than one. Your efforts to exert a helpful influence in the school will be a great help to the preceptors and teachers in their daily work. You may lift from them a heavy burden of anxiety, that they \n\n\n                                    -294- \n\nhave to carry for the many youth that are placed in their care. In such an experience you will find a great blessing, and those who are willing to cooperate with the members of the faculty in maintaining a wholesome influence in the school will gain for themselves a most precious experience. When the teacher sees that you are trying to help him, his heart is greatly cheered. By setting a correct example yourselves, you may be a help to others in forming correct habits. The Lord will help everyone who shall seek to be an example of propriety.",
