    "word": "This has given me such a sadness and grief to know that there are those who have just had their hearts filled with prejudice. And they listen for every word they can catch. Why, there, there it is; they are Perfect. Who says they are perfect? Who claims it? We claim God has given us light in the right time. And now we should receive the truth of God--receive it as of heavenly origin. When we come together to examine the Scriptures, let us have the spirit of Christ. When a point is proven, Oh, they will not acknowledge a word. Why, they see no light, but pour it in, question after question. Well, not one point is settled. They do not acknowledge they have met that point; but pour in a whole list of questions. Now, brethren, we want to know what it is to examine the Scriptures, as those who want light, and not as those who want to shut out the light. May God give us His Holy Spirit here this morning, and may He give us His spirit day by day. We want to walk humbly with God. We want to stand in the light of His countenance. We want the meekness of Christ. God help us that we may learn in the school of Christ every day.",
