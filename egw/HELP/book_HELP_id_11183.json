    "word": "Lessons to Be Learned From Agricultural Process--As they cultivate the soil, the students are to learn spiritual lessons. The plow must break up the fallow ground. It must lie under the rays of the sun and the purifying air. Then the seed, to all appearance dead, is to be dropped into the \n\n\n                                  -178- \n\nprepared soil. Trees are to be planted, seeds for vegetables sown. And after man has acted his part, God's miracle-working power gives life and vitality to the things placed in the soil. In this agricultural process, there are lessons to be learned. Man is not to do slothful work. He is to act the part appointed him by God. His industry is essential if he would have a harvest.--Ms. 71, 1898, p. 2. (\"Come Up to the Help of the Lord,\" June 14, 1898.)",
