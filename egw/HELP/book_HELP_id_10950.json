    "word": "MR No. 710 - SDA's and Politics\n\n     Set Talents in Right Channels.--When your letter came to me on the subject of gold and silver, a political question, I knew that I could not help you by any words that I might say. Your self-confidence would be very strong, and any words I might offer would be as seed sown upon the rock. The Lord did not want you to employ your God-given time, and set your talents to work in wrong channels. Your work has not set you in that line at all. . . .",
