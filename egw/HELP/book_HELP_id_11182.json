Our school should be located where the students can receive an education broader than that which the mere study of books will give. They must have such a training as will fit them for acceptable service if they are called to do pioneer work in mission fields, either in America or in foreign countries. There must be land enough to give an experience in the cultivation of the soil and to help largely in making the institution self-supporting. . . . \n\n\n                                  -176-",
