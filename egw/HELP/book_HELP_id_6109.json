    "word": "Those who have been guilty of requiring so much labor of God's servants, and burdening them with trials, which belonged to themselves to settle, will have to give an account to God for all the time and means that has been spent to gratify themselves, thereby satisfying the enemy. They should be in a situation to help their brethren. They should never defer their trials and difficulties to burden a whole meeting, or wait until some of the messengers come to settle them. But get right before God, have the trials all out of the way, and be prepared to hold up the hands of the laborers, instead of weakening them. \n                                           E. G. W.",
