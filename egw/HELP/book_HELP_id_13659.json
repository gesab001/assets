    "word": "We need and must have fresh supplies every day. And how many souls we may help by communicating to them. All heaven is waiting for channels through whom can be poured the holy oil to be a joy and refreshing to others. We may work continuously and solidly, so that our work may abide, if Christ is abiding with us. I have no fears of any person making blundering work, if he will only become one with Christ. The divine fullness will flow through the consecrated human agent, to be given forth to others. Linked with the unchanging Jesus Himself, there is a representation of Christ in character. Truth, our Saviour continually insisted upon, must be sought after, found, and given to others. He, our Lord and Saviour, insisted that we should sell all to secure the treasure. Self-sacrifice must be seen in this path at every step. There is to be no lifting up of self, not a thread of self-seeking; for this always separates from Christ. . . .",
