    "word": "After we returned from the East [Dec. 21, 1863], I commenced to write [Spiritual Gifts] Volume III,  expecting to have a book of a size to bind in with the testimonies which help compose [Spiritual Gifts] Volume IV. As I wrote, the matter opened before me and I saw it was impossible to get all I had to write in as few pages as I at first designed. The matter opened and Volume III was full. Then I commenced on Volume IV, [VOLUME IV CONTINUED THE OLD TESTAMENT HISTORY FROM THE BUILDING OF THE SANCTUARY TO SOLOMON, 119 PAGES, FOLLOWED BY A 40-PAGE CHAPTER ENTITLED \"HEALTH\" AND THEN SELECTIONS FROM THE TESTIMONIES, BEING A REPRINT OF A MAJOR PORTION OF NOS. 1 TO 10, IN ALL 160 PAGES.] but before I had my work finished, while preparing the health matter for the printers, I was called to go to Monterey. We went, and could not finish the work there as soon as we expected. I was obliged to return to finish the matter for the printers, and we left an appointment for the next week.",
