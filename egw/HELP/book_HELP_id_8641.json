    "word": "There have been altogether too many looking in upon their own trials and difficulties. But when they forget self, and look upon the suffering necessity of others, there will be no time to magnify their own griefs. Earnest work for the Lord is a recipe for mind ailments; and the helpful hand to lift the burdens Christ has borne for all His heritage will lessen our burdens, and they will not seem worth mentioning. True, honest work will give healthy action to the mind by giving healthy action to the muscles. It is the constant manufacturing of ills and burdens that kills. We are to be content to bear the strain of daily duties; and the great pressure of tomorrow's liabilities--leave these cares for the time when we must take them.",
