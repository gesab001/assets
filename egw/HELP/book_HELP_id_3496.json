    "word": "Be Steadfast \n\n     It is not safe to be occasional Christians. We must be Christlike in our actions all the time. Then, through grace, we are safe for time and for eternity. The experimental knowledge of the power of grace received in times of trial is of more value than gold or silver. It confirms the faith of the trusting, believing one. The assurance that Jesus is to him an ever-present Helper gives him a boldness that enables him to take God at His word, and trust Him with unwavering faith under the most trying circumstances.",
