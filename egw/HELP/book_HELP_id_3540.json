    "word": "Physicians in our health institution have many and weighty responsibilities. Their only safety is in keeping their thoughts and impulses under the control of the Great Teacher. They have golden opportunities for doing good; they can guide and mold the many and varied minds with which they are brought in contact. They should take a stand for God. Show men and women connected with the Institute how pure and noble they may become; show them that you have firm confidence in God, and that He is your Source of strength, that you are resting wholly upon the promises. Fulfill your duty with promptness, while claiming your heavenly Father's help to overcome all weakness of character. With the hand of faith grasping the arm of divine power, put your whole being into your work.--Letter 6a, 1890.",
