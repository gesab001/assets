    "word": "I hope all you that are praying children will endeavor to live your prayers. Pray in faith, believing that Jesus hears you. Jesus loves to have children pray to Him. Believe in and trust Him. When you are tempted to speak impatiently, lift up your heart in prayer--silent prayer, if it is not convenient for you to go by yourself. Jesus knows every trial that you bear, every self-denial that you may make, and He can appreciate just how much it \n\n                                     -126- \ncosts you every time to give up your will and way to the desire of others. And Jesus is ready to help when you call upon Him for help.",
