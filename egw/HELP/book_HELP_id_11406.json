    "word": "I am glad that you and I can be a blessing to others by helping forward the work in these new fields. We shall never regret the help that we can afford to render by making donations and loans to needy fields. I am so glad I made the donation of the book, Christ's Object Lessons. It is having a large sale, and the money thus secured is relieving our schools in every place. These schools are a necessity. Our children must be educated to work intelligently. Parents should be more careful to instruct their children in Bible truths, impressing the lessons on their minds. My heart yearns after the children. Schools should be established by our churches. If the brethren and sisters practice self-denial and self-sacrifice, they can have schools, maintaining them by their influence and their means.",
