    "word": "Co-operation Between Our Schools and Sanitariums \n\n     I have been shown that there are decided advantages to be gained by having our schools located near our sanitariums, that the students may receive the benefits of the instruction given to the nurses, and may witness the \n\n\n                                   - 30 - \n\nresults of faithful work done for those who need help and counsel. The benefits of hearty co-operation extend beyond physicians and teachers, students and sanitarium helpers. When a sanitarium is built near a school, those in charge of the educational institution have a grand opportunity of setting a right example before those who all through their life have been easy-going idlers, and who have come to the sanitarium for treatment. The patient will see the contrast between the idle self-indulgent lives that they have lived, and the lives of self-denial and service lived by Christ's followers. They will learn that the object of medical missionary work is to restore, to correct wrongs, to show human beings how to avoid the self-indulgence that brings disease and death.",
