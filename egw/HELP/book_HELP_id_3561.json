    "word": "Encourage the Workers \n\n     We now ask those who shall be chosen as presidents of our conferences to make a right beginning in places where nothing has been done. Recognize the medical missionary work as God's helping hand. As His appointed agency it is to have room and encouragement. Medical missionaries are to have as much encouragement as any accredited evangelist. Pray with these workers. Council with them if they need counsel. Do not dampen their zeal and energy. Be sure by your own consecration \n                                                                           241\nand devotion to keep a high standard before them. Laborers are greatly needed in the Lord's vineyard, and not a word of discouragement should be spoken to those who consecrate themselves to the work.--MS. 33, 1901.",
