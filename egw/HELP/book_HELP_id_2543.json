    "word": "You should never be surprised, you should never be without your armor on. Be prepared for any emergency, for any call of duty. Act promptly. God would have you minute men. Many times workers are too precise, too calculating. While they are getting ready to do a great work, the opportunity for doing a good work passes unimproved. The worker moves on as though the whole burden rested upon himself, a poor, finite man, when Jesus is ready to carry him and his burden too. Brethren, trust self less, and Jesus more. He is willing to save the souls for whom we labor. Because he lives to intercede for us, we shall see of his great power. He \u201cis able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.\u201d [Ephesians 3:20.] Jesus wants us to ask for help; he wants us to cast our helpless souls on him; and he will give us according to our faith.",
