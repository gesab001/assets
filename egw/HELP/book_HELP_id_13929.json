Kress: \n\n\n     I realize that a place like Loma Linda needs experienced men and women to conduct the work in its different departments. But the Lord is willing to work with all who will commit their ways to Him, and who will be led by the Holy Spirit. All are to be workers with Christ. He commits to His true followers the power of persuasion, the power of His grace and truth, a deep and constant love for His work in home and foreign fields. He gives them hearts that are in earnest and gathering with Christ. With helpers possessing such gifts as these, the medical missionary work cannot be without fruit.",
