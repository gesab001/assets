    "word": "Good Illustrations\n \n\n     Christ's figures and illustrations help make the truth plain.--Christ has the right and power to lay all human agencies and influences under tribute in His work for humanity. He uses human instrumentalities, and He does not destroy the individuality of His servants. He puts the Holy Spirit upon them, and shuts them in with Himself, and they have the mind of Christ, and become co-workers with Him. He presents before their minds figures and illustrations with which they are familiar, to make plain the truth He wishes them to communicate, and the Holy Spirit assists them in the use of these figures and illustrations.--BE Aug. 19, 1895.",
