    "word": "The Lord is much displeased by the attitude of some who have thought they were building up the church by murmuring because constant ministerial efforts were not made for the church. They have acted selfishly, as did the elder brother. They have not the spirit of Christ who left the ninety and nine in the fold and went to seek the lost sheep. Instead of using their strength and talents in the work of helping the minister to carry the burden, instead of wearing the yoke of Christ, they have expressed unjust sentiments, speaking as though the church had been robbed of labor it should have had. God has heard their words and has seen their attitude.",
