    "word": "We had a home, and as we found those who were in affliction and had no home, we would open our home to them and let them share our comforts. One widow \n\n\n                                   -137- \n\ncame to me and said, \"I don't know what to do with my children; I cannot make them obey me.\" There was a wealthy man living by her side, and at one time he took me out to show me his buildings and he said, \"I have not room for all my goods.\" Then he said, \"I do not know what will become of that poor widow across the way; another winter she will have to suffer.\" I turned to him and said, \"What about your granaries? Has not God given you this to help the widow and the fatherless?\" Well now, many are just as thoughtless as that.",
