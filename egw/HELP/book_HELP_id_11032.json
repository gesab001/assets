    "word": "Ellen White Needs Help with Children--We thank you for your letter. We hope it will be the first of many which we shall hereafter receive. We miss you very much. We are at a loss to know what to do with our children. There is no one to look after them and you know what children are without an eye over them. . . . I am tired after writing, too much so to be troubled with their chatter and to hear them read or to prepare them work. They are worse now than orphans. I shall try to see if Sister Jones will board them; and then I am afraid they would be ruined with indulgence and playing with Bertie. Addie has no reserve or genuine modesty now. What shall I do? I am trying to get my writings off as fast as possible. I make haste slowly. . . .",
