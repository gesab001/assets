    "word": "Colporteurs are meeting with encouraging success in the sale of our books. The light is thus brought to the people, while the colporteur--who in many cases has been thrown out of employment by accepting the truth--is enabled to support himself, and the sales are a financial help to the office. In the days of the Reformation, monks \n\n38 \n\nwho had left their convents, and who had no other means of support, traversed the country, selling Luther's works, which were thus rapidly circulated throughout Europe. Colportage work was one of the most efficient means of spreading the light then, and so it will prove now.--LS 304, 305.",
