    "word": "God's servants are not to exhaust their time and strength in working especially for those whose whole lifetime has been devoted to the service of Satan, till the entire being is corrupted. As the outcasts come--and they will come, as they came to Christ--we are to forbid them not. We are to reach out to them a helping hand. But God calls for workers to reach those of the higher classes, who, if converted, could in turn work for those of their own standing. He desires to see converted talent and converted influence in the ministry enlisted in His service. The Lord is working upon men and women of talent and influence, leading them to connect with those who are giving the last message of mercy to the world.",
