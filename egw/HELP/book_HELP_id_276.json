    "word": "He heard the footsteps of the mob in search of Him, and said, \u201cRise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray Me.\u201d{CSA 33.10} \nNo traces of His recent agony were visible as Jesus stepped forth to meet His betrayer. Standing in advance of His disciples He said, \u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d They answered, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cI am He.\u201d As these words were spoken, the angel who had lately ministered to Jesus moved between Him and the mob. A divine light illuminated the Saviour\u2019s face, and a dovelike form overshadowed Him. In the presence of this divine glory, the murderous throng could not stand for a moment. They staggered back. Priests, elders, soldiers, and even Judas, fell as dead men to the ground. . . . {CSA 33.11} \n34\nJesus had opportunity to escape, but He remained, calm and self-possessed. As one glorified He stood in the midst of that hardened band, now prostrate and helpless at His feet. The disciples looked on, silent with wonder and awe.",
