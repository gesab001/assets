    "word": "Fulfill Your Responsibility to the Unfortunate.-- It is strange that professed Christian men should disregard the plain, positive teachings of the Word of God and feel no compunctions of conscience. God places upon them the responsibility of caring for the unfortunate, the blind, the lame, the widow, and the fatherless; but many make no effort to regard it. In order to save such, God frequently brings them under the rod of affliction, and places them in positions similar to those occupied by the persons who were in need of their help and sympathy but who did not receive it at their hands.--Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 517. \n                                                                           244",
