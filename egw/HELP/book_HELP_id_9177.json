    "word": "The Lord Jesus invites us to become laborers together with Him. His we are, and He has claims upon all that we possess. By our willingness to help in His work, we may show our love for Him. I appeal to our people just now to send large gifts and offerings to the work in Washington that the buildings necessary for our work there may be erected immediately. For many years, because of a lack of clear, spiritual eyesight, this work has been neglected, but it is now to be earnestly carried forward.",
