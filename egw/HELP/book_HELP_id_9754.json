    "word": "All who profess to be children of God should unceasingly bear in mind that they are missionaries, in their labors brought in connection with all classes of minds. There will be the aristocratic, the proud, the vain, the frivolous, the independent, the complaining, the desponding, the discouraged, the fanatical, the egotistical, the selfish, the avaricious, the pharisaical, the timid, and the sensitive ones; the elevated in mind, and the courteous in manners; the dissipated, the uncourteous, and the superficial; in fact, every grade of character will be found among the patients at the Sanitarium. Those who come to this asylum, come because they need help; and thus, whatever their station or condition, they acknowledge that they are not able to help themselves. These varied minds cannot be treated alike; yet all, whether they be rich or poor, high or low, dependent or independent, need kindness, sympathy, and love. By mutual contact, our minds should receive polish and refinement. We are dependent upon one another,--closely \n                                                                           29\nbound together by the ties of human brotherhood. \n\n\n  \"Heaven forming each on other to depend, \n   A master, or a servant, or a friend, \n   Bids each on other for assistance call, \n   Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all.\"",
