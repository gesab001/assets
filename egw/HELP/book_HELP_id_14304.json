    "word": "Brother B. keep your heart stayed upon the Lord. He lives and reigns. He is our general. Look not to man. Believe not every report that comes to you. Be as a man who has ears, but hears not, and eyes, but sees not. David says, \"I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. Thus was I as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. \"Let the watchman of God keep their own counsels. They will be troubled as they bear their message, but the Lord will help them.",
