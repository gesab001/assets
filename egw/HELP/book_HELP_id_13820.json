    "word": "My brother and sister, be of good courage. Let your hearts be glad and rejoice. There is no need for us to complain; for the Lord is the strength of His people. You may be surprised to hear words that you have heard from _____, but I am not at all surprised. This is the development of the man when the spirit that is counter to the Spirit of God comes upon him. In him as he is at the present time, you have a representation of a man who is not under the molding influence of the Spirit of God. The Lord accepts no such demonstrations of bitterness. They do not become the man, when the Lord has been so gracious to him, helping him in the time of his distress.",
