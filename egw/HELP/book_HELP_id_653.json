    "word": "Timothy a Mere Youth When Chosen \n\n     Paul saw that Timothy was faithful, steadfast, and true, and he chose him as a companion in labor and travel. Those who had taught Timothy in his childhood were rewarded by seeing the son of their care linked in close fellowship with the great apostle. Timothy was a mere youth when he was chosen by God to be a teacher; but his principles had been so established by his early education \n                                                                           32\nthat he was fitted to take his place as Paul's helper. And though young, he bore his responsibilities with Christian meekness.--The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 203, 204.",
