    "word": "MR No. 705 - Faithful Ministers Needed\n\n     There is need of a great reformation in our ranks. The ministers who are drawing pay from the conference need to ask themselves the question \"Am I a faithful worker? Am I a spiritual help to the church?\" There are those who demand high wages for their labors, but who bring few souls into the truth to stand steadfast and true to its principles. It is time for our ministers to humble their hearts before the Lord, and bear a straight, convincing testimony to the people. It is time for them to labor earnestly to increase the membership of the churches, leading all to a thorough understanding of the truth for this time. The Lord wants living members in His church, men and women who will encourage one another in faithful service.-- Letter 172, 1908, p. 5. (To the Officers of the General Conference, May 26, 1908.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 19, 1979",
