    "word": "Everything is to be shaken that can be shaken. God is going to shake the heavens and the earth. He declares, \"Therefore will I shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of His fierce anger\" (Isaiah 13:13). Deep and solemn truth must now be proclaimed, to prepare the way of the Lord. We are not to pay court to wealthy men in order to receive their help. We are not to yield to the temptation to obliterate the distinctive features of the message that is to be proclaimed to arouse the world from its deathlike slumber.",
