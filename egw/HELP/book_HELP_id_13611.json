    "word": "I would like to inquire what progress has been made in the raising of means for the purchase of the land. My investment was not made in order to lessen the responsibility of others who should help. Do what you can to encourage those who have money that they can use in the cause, to use it wisely and not let it slip away into speculation. Secure pledges from those who have not money in sight. We need special wisdom to move out at the right time. I thank the Lord that He encouraged me to walk by faith, and I pray that He will help you to show others their privilege in this matter.",
