    "word": "We find the Health Retreat is quite well filled up with patients. There are also patients in the house of Sister Foelhurst. I remained so short a time at the Health Retreat, being delayed nearly an entire day on the journey, that I am not well informed as to its conveniences. If you feel like having Alice go there, I think they will do their utmost for her. I find no place where she could have two rooms and cook for themselves. There are so many who have children that they dread to have an additional child in the family. Brother and Sister Harris were not retained at the Health Retreat. I have no doubt [that] if you were willing to take the means, you would expend it wisely in sending Alice to Battle Creek. She might be placed in the institution or in a cottage, and have all things convenient and favorable. She could take treatment, and would be helped and made quite comfortable, and we hope quite well. But if you do not do this, send her as soon as possible to St. Helena.",
