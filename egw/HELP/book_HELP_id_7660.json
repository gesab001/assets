    "word": "Poor, helpless, and needy, we come to Thee, not because of our righteousness, but for Thy righteousness sake, O Lord. We beseech Thee not to send us away empty. Our souls, our bodies, are Thy property. Thou has bought us with a price. Not because we are worthy, but for the sake of Thine own Son, strengthen us, that we may put on the garment of Thy righteousness.",
