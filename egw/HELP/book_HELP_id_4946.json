    "word": "We are none of us excusable, under any form of trial, for letting our hold upon God become loosened. Although the compassion of man may fail, still God loves and pities, and reaches out His helping hand. God's everlasting arms encircle the soul that turns to Him for aid.... God loves to have His children ask Him, and trust Him to do for them those things which they cannot do for themselves.--Signs of the Times, May 19, 1898.",
