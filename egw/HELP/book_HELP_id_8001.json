    "word": "You have the fear of God before you, and you will have a trembling lest you will depart from the counsels of God. There will be that trembling. You will be working out your own salvation all the time with fear and trembling. Does it rest here? No, let us hear how the divine power comes in: \"For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure\" (verse 13). Here are man's works, and here are God's works. They both cooperate. Man cannot accomplish this work without the help of the divine power.",
