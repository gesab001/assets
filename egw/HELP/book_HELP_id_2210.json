    "word": "Christ desires to use the youth in His service. He needs missionaries. The barren fields all over the world call to heaven for laborers. If the youth will give themselves to God, He will give them wisdom and knowledge, preparing them for service. If they will consecrate themselves to Him, He will make them vessels unto honor, into which He can pour the precious oil of the Spirit, to be imparted to others. God's helping hand--this is what you may be if you will yield yourselves to His keeping.",
