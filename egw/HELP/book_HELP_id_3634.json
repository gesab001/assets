    "word": "\"To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey.\" If we indulge anger, lust, covetousness, hatred, selfishness, or any other sin, we become servants of sin. \"No man can serve two masters.\" If we serve sin, we cannot serve Christ. The Christian will feel the promptings of sin, for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit; but the Spirit striveth against the flesh, keeping up a constant warfare. Here is where Christ's help is needed. Human weakness becomes united to divine strength, and faith exclaims, \"Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\"",
