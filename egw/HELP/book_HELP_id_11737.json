    "word": "Jesus has stood in your midst in Switzerland, in assemblies and congregations, ready to speak the life-giving word and make the spiritually dead alive by His power; but He has been hindered in this work by your questionings and doubts. Your jealousies, your suggestions, have many of them been prompted by a disposition to have your own way and will. You entreated the Lord to send you help. He heard your cry and came to your relief by sending His servants. And He has been waiting for you to roll away the stone of unbelief from the door of your own hearts before He can do His work.",
