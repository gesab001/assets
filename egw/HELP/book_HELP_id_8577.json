    "word": "January 3, Monday.--Went to the office. Called in to Brother Loughborough's and to my sister's. Wrote seven pages to Doctor Naramores, then took dinner to my sister's. Had a good interview with my father and mother. Went to the office again after dinner, and wrote four pages to Brother Orton's family. Also wrote four pages to Brother Howland's family and wrote to Sister Ashley, and Brother Collin's \n                                                                           323\nfamily. Paid widow Cranson $1.00 for making a couple of shirts. Paid Sister Bognes $1.00 for making a coat. She was unwilling to take it, but I felt it duty to hand it to her. She is poor and sickly. May the Lord pity and care for her. Said Jesus, \"The poor always ye have with you.\" May the Lord rid us of selfishness and help us to care for other's woes and relieve them.",
