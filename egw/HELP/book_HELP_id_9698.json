    "word": "\"We would have all to understand when canvassing for 'Christ's Object Lessons' that they are doing a work that is essential to be  done for the school which should now be going up. The Lord will help each one who will pray and work, and work and pray. The light which I have tried to present before our people is that we must arouse ourselves from sleep, and feel an interest in the school that is to be built up at Berrien Springs. Do not let this matter of erecting suitable buildings fade away from your interest. It is for this purpose that the sale of 'Christ's Object Lessons' should now be vigorously carried forward. Let our prompt action enable the interested ones to make successful the work of moving our school out of Battle Creek.\"",
