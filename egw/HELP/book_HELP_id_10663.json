    "word": "Parents should help their children in this good work, bringing their little ones to the Lord as an offering. Patiently and lovingly they should teach their children that Jesus is their best friend. Let parents take up their neglected duties, and bring their children to Christ. Let them make no delay. If parents did their duty in the fear of the Lord, there would be more children serving in the army of the Lord, being trained and educated to do His will.",
