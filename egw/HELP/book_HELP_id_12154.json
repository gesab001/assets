    "word": "Too often parents give to the world the time and attention that belong to their children. If they would realize the responsibility resting on them, if they would do all in their power for their children, God would work with them, by His Spirit impressing the children's minds. The Lord will not do the work He has given parents to do. But He will be their helper, cooperating with every sincere, unselfish effort they make.",
