    "word": "The young helpers must not be left to be led away from the truth by the unbelievers with whom they are brought in contact. Faithful watchmen are needed in Battle Creek, to sound forth the warning, giving the trumpet a certain sound. We are not to stand by passively, seeing souls exposed to temptation, without doing anything to help them. There is a work to be done for believers and unbelievers, that those who will listen to the truth may have an opportunity to hear and understand. Those who go to Battle Creek, for whatever reason, are souls for whom the Lord gave his only begotten Son.",
