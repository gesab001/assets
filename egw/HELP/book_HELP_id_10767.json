    "word": "MR No. 492 - Work of SDA Pioneers in Scandinavia\n\n     My brother, I have been shown that Elders _____, _____, and yourself have displayed a great lack of wise generalship. You yourself have not developed talent and trained helpers to take hold with you and assist in the work, as you might have done. You have the idea that no one can labor so well as you can. While you have too much to do, others have too little. You do not give others an opportunity to improve in efficiency by practical experience.",
