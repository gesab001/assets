    "word": "As the wrestling ones urge their petitions before God, the veil separating them from the unseen seems almost \n633\nwithdrawn. The heavens glow with the dawning of eternal day, and, like the melody of angel songs, the words fall upon the ear, \u201cStand fast to your allegiance. Help is coming.\u201d Christ, the almighty victor, holds out to his weary soldiers a crown of immortal glory; and his voice comes from the gates ajar: \u201cLo, I am with you. Be not afraid. I am acquainted with all your sorrows; I have borne your griefs. You are not warring against untried enemies. I have fought the battle in your behalf, and in my name you are more than conquerors.\u201d",
