    "word": "God has a purpose in leaving men in their weakness when they turn from Him to follow the dictation of human minds. He wants them to learn where only true light and wisdom dwells. The Lord pities our weakness; he is grieved because of the error that has come in, because of the education that has been given to believers to look to men for wisdom and help. He wants his people to learn lessons of faith and trust in Him, and to stand in the strength of Israel's God. \n\n                                               -",
