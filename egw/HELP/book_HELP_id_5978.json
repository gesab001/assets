    "word": "Two years longer Joseph remained in his gloomy prison. The Lord gave Pharaoh \n                                                                           149\nremarkable dreams. In the morning the king was troubled because he could not understand them. He called for the magicians of Egypt, and the wise men. The king thought that they would soon help him to understand these dreams, for they had a reputation of solving difficulties. The king related his dream to them, but was greatly disappointed to find that with all their magic and boasted wisdom, they could not explain them. The perplexity and distress of the king increased. As the chief butler saw his distress, all at once Joseph came into his mind, and at the same time a conviction of his forgetfulness and ingratitude, \"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day.\" He then related to the king the dreams which he and the chief baker had, which troubled them as the dreams which now troubled the king, and said, \"And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams, to each man according to his dream he did interpret. And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was. Me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\"",
