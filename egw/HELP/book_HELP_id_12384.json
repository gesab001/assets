    "word": "When our children fall into sin and everyone draws away from the misguided youth and would condemn him in an unsparing manner, should not the father and mother show a remarkable tenderness, not making sin appear the less grievous and abhorrent, but helping the inexperienced youth to recover himself? Should not your son who has erred be encouraged to consider that if he returns to his father, confessing his sin, he will be freely and fully pardoned and his disgrace covered with your own pitying love? I know that parents feel very keenly the shame of the wrongdoing of a child that has dishonored them, but does the erring one wound and bruise the heart of the earthly parent any more than we as the children of God bruise our heavenly Parent who has given us and is still giving us His love, inviting us to return and repent of our sins and iniquities and He will pardon our transgression?",
