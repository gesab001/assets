    "word": "\"That ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.\" The Word does not say, \"Count it all joy when ye fall under temptations,\" but \"when ye fall into temptations.\" It is not necessary, because you fall into temptations, that you should fall under them. But it is a comfort to know when you fall into temptation that you are sons and daughters of God, and that the trying of your faith worketh--ill will, murmuring, fretfulness? No, patience! And this is an evidence to us that we are sons and daughters of God, if the trying of our faith worketh patience. But Jesus will help us because we look to God for our support and strength in every emergency.",
