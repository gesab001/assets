    "word": "If we are determined not to be separated from the Source of our strength, Jesus will be just as determined to be at our right hand to help us, that we shall not be put to shame before our enemies. The grace of Christ can accomplish for us that which all our efforts will fail to do. Those who love and fear God may be surrounded with a multitude of cares and yet not falter or make crooked paths for their feet. God takes care of you in the place where it is your duty to be. But be sure, as often as possible, to go where prayer is wont to be made.",
