    "word": "I have words of encouragement for the workers in the South. Self-denial and self-sacrifice have been shown by them in their work. God will strengthen them in every effort they make to advance his kingdom, if they will walk in His way, and do His will. He will give them true happiness. The Lord is their helper. He will prepare the way before them. Misrepresentation and falsehood have done their baleful work, but the Lord declares if his workers will walk humbly with him, he will go before them, and will enable them to do a true work, a work that will ensure their happiness, honor, and usefulness. Hitherto the Lord has helped them. They are under His guidance. They are to put their trust in God, regulating their expenditures according to His directions. Whether they eat or drink, or whatsoever they do, they are to do all to the glory of God.",
