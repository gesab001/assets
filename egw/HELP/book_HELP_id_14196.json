    "word": "Life in Medical Missionary Work. \n\n                 \"Sunnyside\" Cooranbong, May 19, 1898. \n\nDear Brother Irwin: \n         (. . . . . . . . . . .) \n     I hope that now, as never before, you will all, ministers and church-members, come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty powers of darkness. But I have written so much matter that I need not write largely to you. I will inquire why some of our ministerial brethren are so far behind in proclaiming the exalted theme of temperance? Why is it that greater interest is not shown in health reform? There are many who nourish and keep alive a constant prejudice against Dr. Kellogg. He is doing a large work. Why do they not fill their places in the ministry as well and as zealously as he is filling his place? Why do not the ministers of our churches do the very work that ought to have been done years ago? I am glad that someone has taken up the work which has been so neglected.",
