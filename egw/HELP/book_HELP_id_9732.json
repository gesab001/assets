    "word": "Poor Bro. Gregory; he felt the influence of the Spirit of God, but was deficient in experience. He did not turn fully from his old habits and customs. There is no concord between Christ and Belial. Bro. Gregory failed to make God his strength continually, and his feet have slipped. You might have helped him if you had had hold from above, as you should have had. But your course of inactivity, your manner of conversation, your influence, has strengthened him in his backsliding, and quieted the voice of conscience within him. Your course has not been a reproof to him in his downward track. You could do good, were you living for God.",
