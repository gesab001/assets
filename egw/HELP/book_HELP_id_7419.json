    "word": "The time has not come for us to work as if there were no prejudice. Christ said: \"Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\" Matthew 10:16. If you see that by doing certain things which you have a perfect right to do, you hinder the advancement of God's work, refrain from doing those things. Do nothing that will close the minds of others against the truth. There is a world to save, and we shall gain nothing by cutting loose from those we are trying to help. All things may be lawful, but all things are not expedient.",
