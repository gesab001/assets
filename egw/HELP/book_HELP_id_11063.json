    "word": "The Lord loves to hear our prayers, and He would have us receive the things we ask of Him, but if we have no faith then we receive nothing.

We need to encourage a vivid sensibility of our obligations to be missionaries indeed. The Holy Spirit must be with us if we would make a correct impression upon souls.",
