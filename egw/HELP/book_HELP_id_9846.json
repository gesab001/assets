    "word": "In a most remarkable manner, the Lord wrought upon the heart of Marcus Lichtenstein, and directed the course of this young man to Battle Creek, that he should there be brought under the influence of the truth, and be converted, and united to the Office of publication, and should obtain an experience. His education in the Jewish religion would qualify him to prepare publications. His knowledge of Hebrew would be a help to the Office in the preparation of publications to gain access to a class that otherwise could not be reached. The gift God gave to the Office in Marcus was no inferior gift. His deportment and conscientiousness were in accordance with the principles of the wonderful truths he was beginning to see and appreciate.",
