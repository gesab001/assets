    "word": "Head Physician to Be Free from Smaller Responsibilities \n\n\n     The head physician in any institution holds a difficult position, and he should keep himself free from smaller responsibilities; for these leave him no time for rest. He must not gather to himself work that he should not do. He should have sufficient reliable help; for he has trying work to perform. He must bow in prayer with the suffering ones and lead his patients to the great Physician. If as a humble suppliant he seeks his God for wisdom to deal with each case, his strength and influence will be greatly increased. With a sense of God's pure truth in his heart and mind, he is better qualified to perform critical operations, which mean life or death to the afflicted ones.",
