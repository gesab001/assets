    "word": "Edson, don't be in great haste to leave for Trall's. Make the most of your time. Elder [Merritt] Kellogg will start for Trall's November 8, and will get to Battle Creek November 15, and will leave for Trall's November 20. He is writing to Trall that he is coming from California with one more to accompany him, and in Battle Creek will be joined by several and to hold on and not commence his lectures till he gets there with his company. Brother Kellogg has a library of the textbooks and other books that you need. He says you can have the use of these books. One can read to the company and all be benefited. He will be a great help to you all as he is one term in advance of you. He will be a father to you, an excellent counselor; he is humble and has the cause of God at heart. We hope that you will take Brother Kellogg's counsel.--Letter 19, 1872. (To Edson and Emma White, October 25, 1872.)",
