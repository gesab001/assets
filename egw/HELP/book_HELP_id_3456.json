    "word": "Both thought and action will be necessary if you would attain to perfection of character. While brought in contact with the world, you should be on your guard that you do not seek too ardently for the applause of men and live for their opinion. . . .

In the midst of confusion and temptation in the worldly crowd you may, with perfect sweetness, keep the independence of the soul.",
