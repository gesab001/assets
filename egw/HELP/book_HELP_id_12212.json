    "word": "The work you have hold of is only a piece of the work God would have done. Say to your students, I can give you only what the Lord has given me. As you go forth from this school, look to God as your companion, your counselor. Whether you preach the Word, whether you teach in our schools, whether you practice as a physician, whether you cultivate the soil or follow a trade, look to the Lord as your guide, your helper, your friend.",
