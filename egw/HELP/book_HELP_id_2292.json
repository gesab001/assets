    "word": "God has given inquiring minds to youth and children. Their reasoning powers are intrusted to them as precious talents. It is the duty of parents to keep the matter of their education before them in its true meaning; for it comprehends many lines. They should be taught to improve every talent and organ, expecting that they will be used in the service of Christ for the uplifting of fallen humanity. Our schools are the Lord's special instrumentality to fit up the children and youth for missionary work. Parents should understand their responsibility, and help their children to appreciate the great privileges and blessings that God has provided for them in educational advantages.",
