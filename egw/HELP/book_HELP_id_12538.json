    "word": "Now let us bring eternity into our reckoning. Let us live for God every day. We do not know at what time our period of life closes and He \n\n\n                                       -184- \n\nwill come to us saying, \"Give an account of thy stewardship.\" We each have a work to do. I will tell you when He will come to our world: After the gospel of His kingdom has been brought to all parts of the earth; and you had better be in a hurry. God help us to be faithful in the discharge of our duty to preach the gospel to all people, tongues, and nations; that we may arouse to our God-given responsibilities; that we may divest ourselves of every particle of selfishness; that there may be no money expended in flowers or feathers, or in decoration of the body; you cannot afford it. It may be at the cost of a soul. The time that you occupy in self-serving you want to be seeking to open your Bible to awaken the souls that are perishing around you out of the truth, that are ready to die.",
