    "word": "My husband's death was a heavy blow to me, more keenly felt because so sudden.  As I saw the seal of death upon his countenance, my feelings were almost insupportable. I longed to cry out in my anguish.  But I knew that this could not save the life of my loved one, and I felt that it would be unchristian to give myself up to sorrow.  I sought help and comfort from above, and the promises of God were verified to me.  The Lord's hand sustained me.  It is a sin to indulge, without restraint, in mourning and lamentation.  By the grace of Christ, we may be composed and even cheerful under sore trial.",
