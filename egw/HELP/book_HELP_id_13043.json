    "word": "I thank the Lord for health, I thank the Lord for freedom. Why your particular case agonized my soul so continuously I cannot define. Again and again have I seen that blindness was upon you to an alarming degree. I give you up to the hands of Jesus, and then think I have not more to say, not another word, then I find my soul torn with anguish and I am weeping and praying with strong cryings and tears, Take not thy Holy Spirit from him; O, let something from Thy spirit break this spell. . . . O, that you would surrender your will to God's will, O, that you would tremble at his work. Where is your preparation to be obtained that you may stand in the day of the Lord? No where but low at the foot of the cross. O, it is not too late for wrongs to be righted. Do not confer with flesh and blood. Do not say, There are some things I do not understand. Of course there are. Your mind is \n                                                                           800\nclouded, but take one step that you do see, then you can see another. O, kindle your taper from the divine altar before it is everlastingly too late! Remove the stumbling blocks at once without any delay. When God helps you you will be helped to see your own weakness and the inefficiency and the glory and majesty of Christ. The voice of God calls you as it did Elijah, Come out of the cave and stand with God and hear what he will say unto you. When you will come under the divine guidance, the comforter will lead you into all truth. The office of the Holy Spirit is to take the things of Christ as they fall from his lips and infuse them as living principles into the hearts opened to receive them. Then we will know both the Father and the Son.",
