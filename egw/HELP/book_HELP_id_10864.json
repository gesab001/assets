    "word": "The power of Christ to stay disease has been revealed in the past in a remarkable manner. Before we were blessed with institutions where the sick \n\n\n                                    -268- \n\ncould get help from suffering, by diligent treatment and earnest prayer in faith to God, we carried the most seemingly hopeless cases through successfully. Today the Lord invites the suffering ones to have faith in Him. Man's necessity is God's opportunity.",
