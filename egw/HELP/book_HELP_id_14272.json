    "word": "\"And now the work has begun at Nashville. This is in order of the Lord. Nashville is the place for a beginning to be made in the publishing work. In this place there were buildings that could be secured at much less than the original cost. A building suitable for the work was purchased at a very low rate, and the work of publishing was commenced. The Lord provided excellent helpers. Some of these came of their own accord and gave themselves to the work. Who moved them to do this?--The Lord Jesus Christ. He inspired them with a desire to engage in the work, and prepared them for it.",
