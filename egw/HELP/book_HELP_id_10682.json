    "word": "MR No. 421 - Appeal to Workers in San Francisco\n\n     We did think last week that we must leave Battle Creek and go to the Pacific Coast, but we dared not move suddenly or impulsively; there was too much at stake. We have repeatedly had seasons of prayer over the subject, and have not yet dared to move. It may be our duty to remain here until after next camp meeting season, unless we are especially needed upon the Pacific Coast, to help things along there.",
