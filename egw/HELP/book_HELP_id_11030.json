    "word": "Ellen Glad Edson and Emma Are With James--I am glad Edson and Emma are with you. They now have an opportunity to redeem the past and to show, by submitting their judgment and their ideas, that they have reformed. God bless these dear children, and may they be a blessing to you and a great comfort to you. They can be a great help, a great blessing, and in filling the place that they can well fill, God will bless them and be a strength to them. I wish often I could come where you are for a short time.-- Letter 47, 1874, p. 2. (To James White, July 23, 1874.)",
