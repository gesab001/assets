    "word": "Christ is our example, our inspiration, our exceeding great reward. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" 1 Corinthians 3:9. God is the Master Builder, but man has a part to act. He is to co-operate with God. \"We are laborers together with God.\" Verse 9. Never forget the words: \"together with God.\" \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Philippians 2:12, 13. The miracle-working power of Christ's grace is revealed in the creation in man of a new heart, a higher life, a holier enthusiasm. God says: A new heart also will I give you.\" Ezekiel 36:26. Is not this, the renewal of man, the greatest miracle that can be performed?
