{"word": "We are closely to examine ourselves. . . . We should plead with God for spiritual eyesight, that we may discern our mistakes and understand our defection of character. If we have been critical and condemnatory, full of faultfinding, talking doubt and darkness, we have a work of repentance and reformation to do. We are to walk in the light, speaking words that will bring peace and happiness. Jesus is to abide in the soul. And where He is, instead of gloom, murmuring, and repining, there will be fragrance of character.\\97Review and Herald, June 12, 1894.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 62}
