{"word": "The Open and Shut Door\n     Sabbath, March 24th, 1849, we had a sweet and very interesting meeting with the brethren at Topsham, Me. The Holy Ghost was poured out upon us, and I was taken off in the Spirit to the City of the living God. Then I was shown that the commandments of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, relating to the shut door, could not be separated, and that the time for the commandments of God to shine out, with all their importance, and for God's people to be tried on the Sabbath truth, was when the door was opened in the Most Holy Place of the Heavenly Sanctuary, where the Ark is, containing the ten commandments. This door was not opened until the mediation of Jesus was finished in the Holy Place of the Sanctuary in 1844. Then, Jesus rose up and shut the door in the Holy Place, and opened the door in the Most Holy, and passed within the second vail, where he now stands by the Ark, and where the faith of Israel now reaches.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ExV", "page": 24}
