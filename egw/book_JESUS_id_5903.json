{"word": "The truths most plainly revealed in the Bible have been involved in doubt and darkness by learned men, who, with a pretense of great wisdom, teach that the Scriptures have a mystical, a secret, spiritual meaning not apparent in the language employed. These men are false teachers. It was to such a class that Jesus declared, \\93Ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God.\\94 [Mark 12:24.] The language of the Bible should be explained according to its obvious meaning, \n599\nunless a symbol or figure is employed. Christ has given the promise, \\93If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine.\\94 [John 7:17.] If men would but take the Bible as it reads, if there were no false teachers to mislead and confuse their minds, a work would be accomplished that would make angels glad, and that would bring into the fold of Christ thousands upon thousands who are now wandering in error.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 598}
