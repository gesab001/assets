{"word": "Living Success Versus Money.--As we bring ourselves into right relationship with God we shall have success wherever we go; and it is success that we want, not money--living success, and God will give it to us because He knows all about our self-denial. He knows every sacrifice that we make. You may think that your self-denial does not make any difference, that you ought to have more consideration and so on. But it makes a great difference with the Lord.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 612}
