{"word": "If we desire the blessing promised to the obedient, we must observe the Sabbath more strictly. I fear that we often travel on this day when it\n268\nmight be avoided. In harmony with the light which the Lord has given in regard to the observance of the Sabbath, we should be more careful about traveling on the boats or cars on this day. In these matters we should set a right example before our children and youth. In order to reach the churches that need our help, and to give them the message that God desires them to hear, it may be necessary for us to travel on the Sabbath; but so far as possible we should secure our tickets and make all necessary arrangements on some other day. When starting on a journey we should make every possible effort to plan so as to avoid reaching our destination on the Sabbath.", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 267}
