{"word": "In these children who were brought in contact with him, Jesus saw the future men and women who should be heirs of his grace and subjects of his kingdom, and some of whom would become martyrs for his name's sake. He knew that these children would listen to him and accept him as their Redeemer far more readily than would the grown people, many of whom were worldly wise and hard-hearted. In his teaching he came down to their level. Although he was the Majesty of heaven, he did not disdain to answer their questions, and simplify his important lessons to meet their childish understanding. He planted in their expanding minds the seeds of truth, which in after years would spring up, and bear fruit unto eternal life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 66}
