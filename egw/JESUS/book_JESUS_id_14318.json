{"word": "The disciples were overwhelmed with sorrow at the death of Christ. They forgot that He had told them it was to take place. They were without hope. Neither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly accepted the Saviour while He was living. But they had listened to His teachings, and had closely watched every step of His ministry. Although the disciples had forgotten the Saviour's words foretelling His death, Joseph and Nicodemus remembered them well. And the scenes connected with the death of Jesus, which disheartened the disciples, and shook their faith, only proved to these rulers that He was the true Messiah, and led them to take their stand firmly as believers in Him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SJ", "page": 150}
