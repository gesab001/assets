{"word": "The Lord loves you. The Lord is of tender compassion. His promise is, \"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you\" (James 4:8). When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up for you a standard against him. Bear in mind that Jesus Christ is your hope. In the sad, discouraging things that shall come to you at any time, Christ says to you, \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me\" (Isaiah 27:5).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 245}
