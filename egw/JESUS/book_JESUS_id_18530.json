{"word": "Jesus says, \"Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you.\" Gather up every ray, pass not one by. Walk in the light. Practice every precept of truth presented to you. Live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, and you will then follow Jesus wherever He goeth. When the Lord presents evidence upon evidence and gives light upon light, why is it that souls hesitate to walk in the light? Why do men neglect to walk in light to a greater light?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 32}
