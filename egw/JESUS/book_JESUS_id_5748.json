{"word": "Let men beware lest they neglect the lesson conveyed to them in the words of Christ. As he warned his disciples of Jerusalem's destruction, giving them a sign of the approaching ruin, that they might make their escape, so he has warned the world of the day of final destruction, and has given them tokens of its approach, that all who will may flee from the wrath to come. Jesus declares, \\93There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations.\\94 [Luke 21:25; Matthew 24:29; Mark 13:24-26; Revelation 6:12-17.] Those who behold these harbingers of his coming are to \\93know that it is near, even at the doors.\\94 [Matthew 24:33.] \\93Watch ye therefore,\\94 [Mark 13:35.] are his words of admonition. They that heed the warning shall not be left in darkness, that that day should overtake them unawares. But to them that will not watch, \\93the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.\\94 [1 Thessalonians 5:2-5.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 38}
