{"word": "Lessons need to be learned by all who shall step into places where they are to be proved and tested by God, to see whether they shall be registered day by day as faithful and true stewards of God's entrusted talents. Have they shown that they have the fear of God before them, whether they are dealing with superiors, inferiors, or equals?

Yoked up with Christ, they can be more than conquerors through Him.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 328}
