{"word": "Jesus Discerned Man's Infinite Possibilities.--\"God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\" John 3:17. Looking upon men in their suffering and degradation, Christ perceived ground for hope where appeared only despair and ruin.

Souls tempted, defeated, feeling themselves lost, ready to perish, He met, not with denunciation, but with blessing. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 267}
