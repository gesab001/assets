{"word": "It is a great thing to believe in Jesus. We hear many say, \\93Believe, believe, all you have to do is to believe in Jesus.\\94 But it is our privilege to inquire, What does this belief take in, and what does it comprehend? There are many of us who have a nominal faith, but we do not bring that faith into our characters. The statement is made that the devil believed and trembled. While he was in heaven, he believed that Christ was the Son of God, and when upon this earth he was in conflict with Him here on the field of battle. He believed on Christ, but could this save him? No; because he did not weave Christ into his life and character. We must have that faith that works by love and purifies the soul, and this belief in Christ will lead us to put away everything that is offensive in His sight.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 220}
