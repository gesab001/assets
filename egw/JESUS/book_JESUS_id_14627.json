{"word": "\"Then the devil taketh Him up into the Holy City, and setteth Him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto Him, If Thou be the Son of God, cast Thyself down: for it is written, \n                                                                           286\nHe shall give His angels charge concerning Thee: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone.\" What did he leave out the other part for, which says, \"to keep thee in all thy ways\"? While Christ was in the ways of God, no harm could come to Him. Jesus said of Satan, he found \"nothing in Me.\" This temptation of Satan to Christ was a dare. Satan said, \"If\" Thou be the Son of God. What would have been gained if Christ did as Satan asked Him to do? Nothing. Christ meets him with \"It is written.\" Satan saw he could do nothing there.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 285}
