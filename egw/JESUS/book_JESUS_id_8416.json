{"word": "Your life is precious in the sight of God. He has a work for you to do. It is not unfolded to you now, but just walk on trustingly without a single word because this would grieve the dear Jesus and show that you were afraid to trust Him. Lay your hand in His. He is reaching over the battlements of heaven for it to be laid confidingly in His. Oh, what love, what tender love has Jesus manifested in our behalf. The Bible promises are the pinks and the roses and the lilies in the garden of the Lord.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 808}
