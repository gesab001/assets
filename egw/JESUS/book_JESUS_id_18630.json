{"word": "But though the prince of darkness will work to cover the earth with darkness, and with gross darkness the people, the Lord will manifest His converting power. A work is to be accomplished in the earth similar to that which took place at the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the days of the early disciples, when they preached Jesus and Him crucified. Many will be converted in a day; for the message will go with power. It can then be said: \"Our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost\" (1 Thessalonians 1:5). It is the Holy Spirit that draws men to Christ; for He takes of the things of God, and shows them unto the sinner. Jesus said: \"He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you\" (John 16:14).--Review and Herald, Nov. 29, 1892.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 126}
