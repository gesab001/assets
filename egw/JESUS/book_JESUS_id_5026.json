{"word": "The heart of the true minister is filled with an intense longing to save souls. . . . He watches for souls as one that must give an account. With his eyes fixed on the cross of Calvary, beholding the uplifted Saviour, relying on His grace, believing that He will be with him until the end, as his shield, his strength, his efficiency, he works for God. With invitations and pleadings, mingled with the assurances of God's love, he seeks to win souls to Jesus, and in heaven he is numbered among those who are \"called, and chosen, and faithful\" (Revelation 17:14).", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 28}
