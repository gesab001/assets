{"word": "Jesus does not lose sight of His people who have so many discouragements to encounter. It requires little effort to float with the popular current, but those who would gain the immortal shores must struggle against wind and tide. There is a form of Christianity--a spurious article--which has no reformative energy. Its possessors delight to oppose and decry the faith of others.

Their religious experience runs in the corrupt channel of the world.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 359}
