{"word": "What a prayer is this! How evident it is that sinners in the household are not to be treated with indifference, but that the Lord looks upon them as the purchase of His blood. In every household where the unconverted are, it should be the work of those who know the Lord to work in wisdom for their conversion. The Lord will surely bless the efforts of parents, as in His fear and love they seek to save the souls of their households. The Lord Jesus is waiting to be gracious.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 136}
