{"word": "I praise the Lord this morning for the peace I enjoy. There is perfect rest for me in the Lord. I trust in His love. Why should we not rest in the love of God, the assurance of His word? What saith Jesus? \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" What can be more positive than this promise? \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). Then come; let us who believe in Jesus Christ not delay a moment, but come.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 158}
