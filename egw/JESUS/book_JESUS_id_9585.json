{"word": "As the palm tree, drawing nourishment from fountains of living water, is green and flourishing in the midst of the desert, so the Christian may draw rich supplies of grace from the fountain of God's love, and may guide weary souls, that are full of unrest and ready to perish in the desert of sin, to those waters of which they may drink, and live. The Christian is ever pointing his fellow men to Jesus, who invites, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.\" John 7:37. This fountain never fails us; we may draw, and draw again.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 331}
