{"word": "The manifestation of the Holy Spirit was similar to its manifestation in the days of Samuel and Saul in the school of the prophets. On one occasion the showers of grace were outpoured, and all that were gathered together were prophesying. Saul drew near, and though when he came, he was filled with a restless, envious, jealous spirit because of David, yet he caught the spirit that was animating those who were praising God, and he also sang praises. The word of inquiry went out, \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\" The Lord would be glorified if hallelujahs of rejoicing were heard in our schools. The willing and obedient who have received the teaching of the Holy Spirit will rejoice in the Lord, saying, \"O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy endureth forever.\" If the people of God rightly appreciated the temporal and spiritual blessings which the Lord has poured upon them through Jesus Christ, continual praise would be upon their lips. We have had an experience in being relieved from spiritual bondage similar to that of the Israelites who were set free from the bondage of Egypt. Have we not had chains of oppression broken, and Red Seas of impossibilities opened up before us? Have we not \n                                                                           80\nbeen fed with manna from heaven? Have not the words of Christ come home to the soul, \"This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world\"? We are to feast continually upon this heavenly manna. We are to drink continually of the water of life. Jesus says, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 79}
