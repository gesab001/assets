{"word": "The religion of Jesus Christ makes us better men and better women. . . .Christ came to our world to reshape the deformed character of humanity. It was a very crooked character. God wants us to be His sons and His daughters. He wants us, during the hours of probation here, to be fitted up with all these graces that He has presented \\93according as his divine power hath given unto us all things.\\94 Nothing is withheld that pertains unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him that hath called us to glory and virtue. Then the rich promise is that we shall be partakers of the divine nature. This means everything to us, to be a partaker of the divine nature.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 206}
