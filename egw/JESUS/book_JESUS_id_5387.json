{"word": "All who are followers of Christ should deal with one another exactly as we wish the Lord to deal with us in our errors and weaknesses; for we are all erring, and need his pity and forgiveness. Jesus consented to take human nature, that he might know how to pity, and how to plead with his Father in behalf of sinful, erring mortals. He volunteered to become man's advocate, and he humiliated himself to become acquainted with the temptations wherewith man was beset, that he might succor those who should be tempted, and be a tender and faithful high priest.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 94}
