{"word": "Christ claimed to be the Only Begotten of the Father, but men encased in unbelief, barricaded with prejudice, denied the Holy and the Just One. He was charged with blasphemy, and was condemned to a cruel death, but He burst the fetters of the tomb, and rose from the dead triumphant, and over the rent sepulcher of Joseph He declared, \"I am the resurrection, and the life\" (John 11:25). All power in heaven and in earth was vested in Him, and the righteous will also come forth from the tomb free in Jesus. They shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead. \"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father\" (Matthew 13:43).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 271}
