But the principal cause of their trials, is an unsubdued heart, which makes self so sensitive, that it is often crossed.

Ever keep Jesus in your mind, that he is your example, and you must tread in his footsteps. Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame. He endured the contradiction of sinners against himself. He for your sins, was once the meek slain lamb, wounded, bruised, smitten and afflicted.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ExV54", "page": 32}
