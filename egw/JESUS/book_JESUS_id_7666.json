{"word": "Preparation for Their Work\n     Very much more efficient work can be done in the canvassing field than has yet been done. The canvasser should not rest satisfied unless he is constantly improving. The Lord desires every one to improve to the utmost the talents committed to his trust. He desires the workers in His cause to study His word diligently, that its practical teaching may have a positive bearing upon their lives. The faithful, youthful Timothy was taught by experienced men of God's appointment how to study \n17\nthe word and how to explain it. Paul, his father in the gospel, speaking by the Holy Spirit, addressed him in the words: \\93Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.\\94 \\93Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\\94 \\93Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.\\94 \\93And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\\94 2 Timothy 2:1, 15; 1:13; 2:2, 3. Here is a thought that we should do well to ponder. Timothy was to make the very best use of his powers in hearing the word of the Lord from the lips of Paul. This instruction he was faithfully to preserve, and entrust to men who would impart the principles of truth.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MC", "page": 16}
