{"word": "Jesus is our advocate, our High Priest, our Intercessor. Our position is like that of the Israelites on the Day of Atonement. When the High Priest entered the most holy place, representing the place where our High Priest is now pleading, and sprinkled the atoning blood upon the mercy seat, no propitiatory sacrifices were offered without. While the priest was interceding with God, every heart was to be bowed in contrition, pleading for the pardon of transgression.--The Signs of the Times, June 28, 1899.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "7ABC", "page": 482}
