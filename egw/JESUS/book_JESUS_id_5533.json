{"word": "Well would it be for us if we could always remember Calvary, where Jesus bore the terrible burden of the sins of the world. In his expiring agony hear him exclaim, \\93My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!\\94 [Matthew 27:46.] and remember that he endured the hiding of his \n420\nFather's face, that it might not be forever hidden from fallen man. He endured shame, cruel scourging, insult, and mockery, that we might be reconciled to God and rescued from endless death. If our minds dwell upon these themes, our conversation will be in heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, and even vain thoughts will seem out of place.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 419}
