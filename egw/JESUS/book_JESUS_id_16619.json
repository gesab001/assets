{"word": "Our Saviour withstood on every point the test of temptation, and in this way He has made it possible for man to overcome. Now, there is enough in this idea, in this thought, to fill our hearts with gratitude every day of our lives.

He took our nature that He might become acquainted with the trials wherewith man should be beset, and He is our mediator and intercessor before the Father.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 32}
