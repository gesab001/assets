He has not cast them off. When Mary Magdalene told them she had seen the Lord, she repeated the call to the meeting in Galilee. And a third time the message was sent to them.

Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see Me.\"--DA 793 (1898).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 70}
