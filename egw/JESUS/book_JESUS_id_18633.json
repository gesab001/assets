{"word": "Jesus is our atoning sacrifice; we can make no atonement for ourselves, but by faith we can accept the atonement that has been made. \"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God\" (1 Peter 3:18). \"Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, . . . but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot\" (1 Peter 1:18, 19). \"The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin\" (1 John 1:7). It is by virtue of this precious blood that the sin-stricken soul can be restored to soundness. While you are putting up your petition to God, the Holy Spirit applies the faithful promises of God to your heart.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 133}
