{"word": "Many nights during the past nine months I was enabled to sleep but two hours a night, and then at times darkness would gather about me; but I prayed, and realized much sweet comfort in drawing nigh to God.  The promises, \"Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you\" (James 4:8), \"When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him\" (Isaiah 59:19), were fulfilled to me. I was all light in the Lord.  Jesus was sacredly near, and I found the grace given sufficient, for my soul was stayed upon God, and I was full of grateful praise to Him who loved me and gave Himself for me.  I could say from a full heart, \"I know whom I have believed\" (2 Timothy 1:12). \"God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it\" (1 Corinthians 10:13).  Through Jesus Christ I have come off more than conqueror, and held the vantage ground.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "RY", "page": 143}
