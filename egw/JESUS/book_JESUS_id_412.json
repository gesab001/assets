{"word": "77\n     Above all things, seek God while in health, that he may be your support and strength if you should be sick or dying. Your parents have the deepest interest for you. But we cannot repent of your sins for you. We cannot take you to heaven. God alone in his love and infinite mercy can save you, and Jesus, the dear Saviour, invites you to his loving arms.  He offers you salvation freely, if you will believe in him, love him, and render cheerful obedience. Do so, dear children. \\93They that seek Me early, shall find Me.\\94 May the Lord lead you, dear children, to his own fold.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AY", "page": 77}
