{"word": "I will pray for you, but for Christ's sake seek the meekness, the simplicity, and the love of Jesus. Let His love break down every barrier. Come close to your brethren. You need not countenance wrongdoing in a single instance, but you can impress hearts that you long to co-operate with Christ in saving the souls for whom He has died. I entreat you to seek God. I urge you to open the door of your heart and let the love and tender compassion of Christ in, and then let it out in tender words and offices of love. May the Lord give you wisdom is my prayer.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 73}
