{"word": "Last night a heavy burden rested upon me in regard to the great work that is to be done. It is a work that calls for the exercise of all the capabilities that men possess. Will you not exercise your capabilities in a way that will bring you into perfect union with Jesus Christ? As parents and teachers we are to cooperate with the divine Teacher. We are to labor to restore to men and women the sense of moral obligation which has been lost. Let every parent now cooperate with the divine plan, and thus become laborers together with God.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 71}
