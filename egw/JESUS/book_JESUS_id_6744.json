{"word": "\"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world\" (Matthew 25:34). Do we want this benediction? I do, and I believe you do. May God help you that you may fight the battles of this life and gain a victory day by day and at last be among the number that shall cast their crowns at Jesus' feet and touch the golden harps and fill all heaven with sweetest music. I want you to love my Jesus.... Do not reject my Saviour, for He has paid an infinite price for you. I see in Jesus matchless charms, and I want you to see these charms.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 369}
