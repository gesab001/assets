{"word": "The disciples of Christ will be fitted by His grace for every trial and test as he strives for perfection of character. By looking away from Jesus to some other one, or to something else, he may sometimes make mistakes; but as soon as he is warned of his danger, he again fastens his eyes upon Jesus, in whom his hope of eternal life is centered, and he plants his feet in the footprints of his Lord, and travels on securely. He rejoices, saying, \"He is my living intercessor before God. He prays in my behalf. He is my advocate, and clothes me with the perfection of His own righteousness. This is all I require to enable me to bear shame and reproach for His dear name's sake. If he permits me to endure persecution, He will give me grace and the comfort of His presence, so that His name shall be thereby glorified\" (Review and Herald, May 12, 1896). \n                                                                           111", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 110}
