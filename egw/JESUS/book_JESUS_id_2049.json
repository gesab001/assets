{"word": "Christ Values Deeds of Love \n\n     Christ values acts of heartfelt courtesy. When any one did Him a favor, with heavenly politeness He blessed the actor. He did not refuse the simplest flower plucked by the hand of a child, and offered to Him in love. He accepted the offerings of children, and blessed the givers, inscribing their names in the book of life. In the Scriptures, Mary's anointing of Jesus is mentioned as distinguishing her from the other Marys. Acts of love and reverence for Jesus are an evidence of faith in Him as the Son of God.-- DA 564.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 145}
