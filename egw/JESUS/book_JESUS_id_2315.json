{"word": "Chap. 25 - Literature in the Closing Work\n\n     The End of All Things at Hand.--The great and wonderful work of the last gospel message is to be carried on now as it has never been before. The world is to receive the light of truth through an evangelizing ministry of the Word in our books and periodicals. Our publications are to show that the end of all things is at hand. I am bidden to say to our publishing houses: \"Lift up the standard; lift it up higher. Proclaim the third angel's message, that it may be heard by all the world. Let it be seen that 'here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.' Revelation 14:12. Let our literature give the message as a witness to all the world.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CW", "page": 177}
