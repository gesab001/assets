{"word": "In all our afflictions Jesus was afflicted, and the Captain of our salvation was made perfect through suffering. In this life we shall be proved to see whether or not we shall be able to bear the test of God. Satan's temptations will come upon us, and we shall be tried, but the question of most importance to us is Shall we be overcome? or shall we be overcomers? . . . Like our great Example, we may be able to meet Satan with the weapon of God's Word, saying to him as he tempts us to do evil, \"It is written\" (Matthew 4:4).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 370}
