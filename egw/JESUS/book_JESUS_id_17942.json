{"word": "The more you preserve your Christian integrity to know and understand for yourself the way of life and salvation, the less of the worldly mold will be upon you. The more you know of Jesus, the more you will desire to know, and the more ignorant you will feel that you are in regard to things of eternal interest. We want the right spirit, the teachable spirit, willing to learn in Christ's school the lessons of humility and meekness. \"Learn of me,\" said the heavenly Teacher, \"for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:29, 30).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 34}
