{"word": "If you come into close relationship to Jesus Christ you see wondrous things out of His law that are not now seen. The softening, subduing influence of the Spirit of God upon human hearts and minds will make the true children of God to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Christian culture will be carried on in every heart worked by the Holy Spirit. There will be a soft, subdued spirit in all those who are looking unto Jesus. The love of Jesus always leads to Christian courtesy, refinement of language, and purity of expression that testify the company we are with--that like Enoch we are walking with God. There is no storming, no harshness, but a sweet fragrance in speech and in spirit.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 198}
