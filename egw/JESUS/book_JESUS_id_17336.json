{"word": "Our time here is short at best, and we want every move we shall make to tell in the strengthening and the advancement of the cause of God. . . . Let your cry be to God, Convert my inmost soul. Plead with God for the transforming power of His grace. Hold fast to your Saviour as did Jacob, until God shall not only reveal to you yourself, but shall reveal to you Himself, and you shall see in Jesus a strength and support, a brightness and power you have never sensed and realized. . . . If your faith perseveringly grasps the promises, you will prevail. This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 334}
