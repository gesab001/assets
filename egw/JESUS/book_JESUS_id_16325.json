{"word": "God has given us Jesus, and in Him is the revelation of God. Our Redeemer says: \"If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him.\" \"Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, \n                                                                           170\nye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.\" If we know God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, unspeakable gladness will come to the soul. Oh, how we need the divine presence! For the baptism of the Holy Spirit every worker should be breathing out his prayer to God. Companies should be gathered together to call upon God for special help, for heavenly wisdom, that the people of God may know how to plan and devise and execute the work.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 169}
