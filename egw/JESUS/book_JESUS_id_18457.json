{"word": "One may say, \"I have no opportunity to obtain money, but I will set apart myself. I will educate and train myself that no opportunity shall be allowed to pass unimproved. I have always kept myself busy, but after all I have not felt a satisfaction in the way my time has been occupied. I see now as never before that very much of my time has been employed in doing nothing but those things that pleased myself. Now I desire to please God, and I will give a portion of my time in doing real service for the Master. I will visit the sick, I will train myself to have an interest and sympathy for the suffering ones, and I will add if possible some favors to make them more comfortable. Through this means I can reach their hearts and speak a word as the servant of Jesus Christ. Thus I can cultivate the art of ministering, and may win souls to Jesus.\" Can you not see that Jesus will say, \"Well done\" to this line of ministry?--Letter 12, 1892. \n                                                                           168", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 166}
