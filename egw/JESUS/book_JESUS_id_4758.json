{"word": "Those who cherish doubts will boast of their independence of mind; but they are far enough from possessing genuine independence. Their minds are filled with slavish fear, lest some one as weak and superficial as themselves should ridicule them. This is weakness, and slavery to the veriest tyrant. True liberty and independence are found in the service of God. His service will place upon you no restriction that will not increase your happiness. In complying with His requirements, you will find a peace, contentment, and enjoyment that you can never have in the path of wild license and sin. Then study well the nature of the liberty you desire. Is it the liberty of the sons of God, to be free in Christ Jesus? or do you call the selfish indulgence of base passions freedom? Such liberty carries with it the heaviest remorse; it is the cruelest bondage.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 88}
