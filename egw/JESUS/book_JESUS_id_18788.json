{"word": "The Lord Jesus acts through the Holy Spirit; for it is His representative. Through it He infuses spiritual life into the soul, quickening its energies for good, cleansing it from moral defilement, and giving it a fitness for His kingdom. Jesus has large blessings to bestow, rich gifts to distribute among men. He is the wonderful Counselor, infinite in wisdom and strength; and if we will acknowledge the power of His Spirit, and submit to be molded by it, we shall stand complete in Him. What a thought is this! In Christ \"dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him\" (Colossians 2:9, 10).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 344}
