{"word": "The work will be similar to that of the day of Pentecost. As the \\93former rain\\94 was given, in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing of the precious seed, so the \\93latter rain\\94 will be given at its close, for the ripening of the harvest. \\93Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord; his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\\94 [Hosea 6:3.] \\93Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God; for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain.\\94 [Joel 2:23.] \\93In the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\\94 \\93And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\\94 [Acts 2:17, 21.] The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies which were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close. Here are \\93the times of refreshing\\94 to which the apostle Peter looked forward when he said, \\93Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out [in the investigative Judgment], when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus.\\94 [Acts 3:19, 20.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 611}
