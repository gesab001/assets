{"word": "To tell tempted souls of their guilt in no way inspires them with a determination to do better. . . . Hold up before them the possibilities that are theirs. Point them to the heights to which they may attain. Help them to take hold upon the mercy of the Lord, to trust in His forgiving power. Jesus is waiting to clasp them by the hand, waiting to give them power to live a noble, virtuous life.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 89}
