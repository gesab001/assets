{"word": "Chap. 47 - The Truth as It Is in Jesus\n[THIS\nARTICLE APPEARED IN THE REVIEW AND\nHERALD, JUNE 17, 1890.]\n\n     In giving His only-begotten Son to die for sinners, God has manifested to fallen man love that is without a parallel. We have full faith in the scripture that says, \"God is love\" (1 John 4:8); and yet many have shamefully perverted this word, and have fallen into dangerous error because of a false interpretation of its meaning. God's holy law is the only standard by which we can estimate divine affection. If we do not accept the law of God as our standard, we set up a standard of our own. God has given us precious promises of His love, but we are not to ascribe to Jehovah a tenderness that will lead Him to pass over guilt and wink at iniquity.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 311}
