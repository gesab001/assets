{"word": "Christ says, I am at thy right hand to help thee. What more could we in our weakness desire? Shall we go to one another with all our troubles, telling human beings the temptations we have and how weak we are? The Saviour is standing at our right hand, offering to lift us up, that we may \"sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\" Ephesians 2:6. But so often we turn away from Him and His promises, and tell our troubles to those who, like ourselves, are but mortal, with troubles which only Christ can bear. . . . Let us no longer dishonor God by turning from Him to human inefficiency. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 325}
