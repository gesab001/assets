{"word": "The Pharisees had gathered close about Jesus as he answered the questions of the scribe. He now turned to them and put them a question: \"What think ye of Christ? Whose son is he?\" Jesus was evidently testing the faith of the Pharisees in his divinity, whether they regarded him simply as a man, or the divine Son of God. A chorus of voices answered simultaneously, \"The son of David.\" This was the title which prophecy had given to the Messiah. When Jesus had revealed his divinity by his mighty miracles, when the sick were healed and the dead restored to life, the people had marveled and inquired among themselves, \"Is not this the son of David?\" The Syrophenician woman, blind Bartimeus, and many others had cried aloud to him for help, \"Thou son of David, have mercy on me!\" Only a few hours before, while riding into Jerusalem, he had been hailed with joyful \"Hosannas to the son of David, Blessed is He who cometh in the name of the Lord,\" and the little children in the temple had that day echoed the same glad shouts.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 55}
