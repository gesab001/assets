{"word": "Those who have received a false education do not look heavenward. They cannot see the One who is the true Light, \"which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" They look upon eternal realities as phantoms, calling an atom a world, and a world an atom. Of many who have received the so-called higher education, God declares, \"Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting,\"--wanting in a knowledge of practical business, wanting in a knowledge of how to make the best use of time, wanting in a knowledge of how to labor for Jesus.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 468}
