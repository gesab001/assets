All profess to be Christ's followers; but while one class walk in humility and meekness, learning of Jesus, the other show that they are not doers of the Word, but hearers only.

The latter are indulging their own lusts, and becoming the servants of Satan. \n                                                                           259", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 258}
