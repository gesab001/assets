{"word": "Christ does not weigh character in scales of human judgment. He says, \"I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me\" (John 12:32). Every soul who responds to this drawing will turn from iniquity. Christ is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto Him. He who comes to Jesus is setting his feet upon a ladder that reaches from earth to heaven. Teach it by pen, by voice, that God is above the ladder; the bright rays of His glory are shining upon every round of the ladder. He is looking graciously upon all who are climbing painfully upward, that He may send them help, divine help, when the hand seems to be relaxing and the foot trembling. Yes, tell it, tell it in words that will melt the heart, that not one who shall perseveringly climb the ladder will fail of an entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour \n                                                                           182\nJesus Christ; those who believe in Christ shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of His hand.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 181}
