{"word": "\"Grace and peace\" will be multiplied \"through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.\" Here is the Source of all spiritual power, and faith must be in constant exercise, for all spiritual life is from Christ. Knowledge of God inspires faith in Him as the only channel to convey heaven's blessing to the soul, elevating, ennobling, refining the soul, as--through the knowledge of God--it is brought up to the high attainment of glory and virtue. \"According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 67}
