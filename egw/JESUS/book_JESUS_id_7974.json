{"word": "Many Converted and Healed \n\n     Every sincere Christian bows to Jesus as the true Physician of souls. When he stands by the bedside of the afflicted, there will be many not only converted, but healed. If through judicious ministration the patient is led to give his soul to Christ, and to bring his thoughts into obedience to the will of God, a great victory is gained.--R.H., May 9, 1912.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 197}
