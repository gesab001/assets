{"word": "As we walk with Jesus in this life, we may be filled with His love, satisfied with His presence. All that human nature can bear, we may receive here.

For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters.\" Revelation 7:15-17. \n                                                                           368", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 367}
