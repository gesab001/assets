{"word": "We profess to be pilgrims and strangers on earth, journeying to a better country, even an heavenly. If we are indeed but sojourners here, traveling to a land where none but the holy can dwell, we shall make it our first business to become acquainted with that country; we shall make diligent inquiry as to the preparation needed, the manners and character which we must have in order to become citizens there. Jesus, the King of that land, is pure and holy. He has commanded His followers, \"Be ye holy; for I am holy\" (1 Peter 1:16). If we are hereafter to associate with Christ and sinless angels we must here obtain a fitness for such society.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 169}
