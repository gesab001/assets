{"word": "13, 14, 29-32. Satan Filled With Frenzy.--The heavenly heralds aroused all the wrath of the synagogue of Satan. He followed the steps of those who had charge of the infant Jesus. He heard the prophecy of Simeon in the temple courts, who had long been waiting for the consolation of Israel. The Holy Ghost was upon him and he came by the Spirit into the temple. Taking the infant Saviour in his arms, he blessed God, and said, \"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.\" Satan was filled with frenzy as he saw that the aged Simeon recognized the divinity of Christ (RH Oct. 29, 1895).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1116}
