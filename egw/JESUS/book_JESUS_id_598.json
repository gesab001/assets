{"word": "Age of No Consequence.--An eminent divine was once asked how old a child must be before there was reasonable hope of his being a Christian. \"Age has nothing to do with it,\" was the answer. \"Love to Jesus, trust, repose, confidence, are all qualities that agree with the child's nature. As soon as a child can love and trust his mother, then can he love and trust Jesus as the Friend of his mother. Jesus will be his Friend, loved and honored.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 486}
