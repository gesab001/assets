{"word": "The fact that human beings can please God is a wonderful incentive for us to make the most persevering, intense efforts, efforts which are proportionate to the value of the object that we are seeking to gain. \\93We are labourers together with God: ye are God\\92s husbandry, ye are God\\92s building.\\94 . . . Enoch walked with God. He was not satisfied with his own companionship. He walked with God. He pleased God. The Lord is not pleased when those whom He has created are sinners. We are ever to walk with God and learn of Jesus Christ, who has overcome every temptation wherewith we are beset. He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 53}
