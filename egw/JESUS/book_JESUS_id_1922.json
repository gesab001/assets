{"word": "The Physician Can Point to Jesus \n\n     The physician can do a noble work if he is connected with the Great Physician. To the relatives of the sick, whose hearts are full of sympathy for the sufferer, he may find opportunity to speak the words of life; and he can soothe and uplift the mind of the sufferer by leading him to look to the One who can save to the uttermost all who come to Him for salvation.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 333}
