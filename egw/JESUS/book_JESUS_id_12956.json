{"word": "Jesus replied to them with solemn dignity: \"My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready. The world cannot hate you; but \n                                                                           338\nme it hateth, because I testify of it that the works thereof are evil. Go ye up unto this feast; I go not up yet unto this feast, for my time is not yet full come.\" The world loved those who were like itself; but the contrast between Christ and the world was most marked; there could be no harmony between them. His teachings, and his reproofs of sin, stirred up its hatred against him. The Saviour knew what awaited him at Jerusalem, he knew that the malice of the Jews would soon bring about his death, and it was not his place to hasten that event by prematurely exposing himself to their unscrupulous hatred. He was to patiently await his appointed time.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 337}
