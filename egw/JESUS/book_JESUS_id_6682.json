{"word": "We should remember that all make mistakes; even men and  women who have had years of experience sometimes err. But God does not cast them off because of their errors; to every erring son and daughter of Adam He gives the privilege of another trial. The true follower of Jesus manifests a Christlike spirit toward his erring brother. Instead of speaking in condemnation, he remembers the words, \"He which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins\" (James 5:20).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 290}
