{"word": "In all His Godlike deeds, the world's Redeemer declares, \"I can of mine own self do nothing.\" \"This commandment have I received of my Father.\" John 5:30; 10:18. All I do is in fulfillment of the counsel and will of My heavenly Father. The history of the daily earthly life of Jesus is the exact record of the fulfillment of the purposes of God toward man. His life and character were the unfolding or representation of the perfection of the character that man may attain by becoming a partaker of the divine nature, and overcoming the world through daily conflicts.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 114}
