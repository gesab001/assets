{"word": "Chap. 78 - God's Love for Sinners\n\n     Dear Brother P: I see by your letter that you are in a state of unbelief, questioning whether there is hope in your case. As Christ's ambassador I would say to you: Hope thou in God.\" He so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Now cannot you take courage from this gracious promise? Satan may tell you many times that you are a sinner; but you can answer: True, I am a sinner; but Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.\"'", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 629}
