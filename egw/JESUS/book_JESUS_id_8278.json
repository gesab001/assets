{"word": "Counsel to a Wife Regarding Personal Relationships. --I am instructed by the Lord to say to you, \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able\" (Luke 13:24). The Lord asks you to keep close to Him. Speak as He would speak, and act as He would act. Do not let anyone prejudice your mind and lead you to speak unadvisedly. Keep your own soul pure and clear and your thoughts elevated and sanctified. Do not praise or exalt people to their injury, neither be hasty to condemn those whom you think are not acting wisely. Let all see that you love Jesus and trust in Him. Give your husband and your believing and unbelieving friends evidence that you desire them to see the beauty of truth. But do not show that painful, worrying anxiety which often spoils a good work.--Lt 145, 1900.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 435}
