{"word": "Jesus said to his disciples, \\93Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.\\94 [Matthew 11:29.] I would plead with those who have accepted the position of teachers, first to become humble learners, and ever to remain as pupils in the school of Christ, to receive from the Master lessons of meekness and lowliness of heart. Humility of spirit, combined with earnest activity, will result in the salvation of souls so dearly purchased by the blood of Christ. The minister may understand and believe the theory of truth, and be able to present it to others; but this is not all that is required of him. \\93Faith without works is dead.\\94 [James 2:20.] He needs the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. A living faith in Christ will bring every action of the life and every emotion of the soul into harmony with God's truth and righteousness.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 28}
