{"word": "Christ will appear to the discerning eye the perfection of attractive loveliness; then His mould will be upon mind and heart, and will be revealed in the character. The impress of the divine mind should be made upon the heart, and manifested in the life. Come to Jesus in your need, pray in living faith, hold fast to the hand of divine power, believe, only believe, and you will see the salvation of God. If you will be taught, God will teach you; if you will be led, He will lead you to fountains of living waters. The Saviour invites you, \\93Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\\94 Some for whom you labour will wish to have the work done in their own way, thinking their way is best; but if you have the spirit, the meekness of Christ, if you show respect and love for one another, God will enable you to perfect the work in a manner that will please Him. Show that you yourselves are willing to be taught.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 26}
