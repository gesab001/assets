{"word": "The  Mother of James and John\nMark 10:35-41. \n     James and John presented by their mother a petition  requesting that they might be permitted to occupy the highest positions of honor in Christ's kingdom. The Saviour answered, \"Ye know not what ye ask.\" Mark 10:38. How little do many of us understand the true import of our prayers! Jesus knew the infinite sacrifice at which that glory must be purchased, when He, \"for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame.\" Hebrews 12:2. That joy was to see souls saved by His humiliation, His agony, and the shedding of His blood.--SL 56 (1883).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 66}
