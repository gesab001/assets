{"word": "A Progressive Work \n\n     Sanctification is a progressive work. The successive steps are set before us in the words of Peter: \"Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ\" (2 Peter 1:5-8). \"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ\" (verses 10, 11).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SL", "page": 94}
