{"word": "Spirit and Life for the Colored People \n\n\n     The psalmist says, \"The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\" Heavenly intelligences are close by the side of every one who is seeking to open the Word of God to the understanding of the simple, or to those who are really desirous of becoming acquainted with the will of God. Those who open the Scripture to others should teach them the Word of life, realizing the solemn, sacred work that they are doing; for they are bringing souls in contact with God and with Jesus Christ, whom He has sent. Any trifling, jesting, or joking over the Word of God is dishonoring to Him, and leaves an influence that is anything but good upon the mind. But if we desire to enlarge a man's mind, let us turn his attention to the Scriptures. In the Bible we behold Him who is the way, the truth, and the life. Through understanding the Word of God, efficiency is obtained for both the practical and the religious life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SW", "page": 51}
