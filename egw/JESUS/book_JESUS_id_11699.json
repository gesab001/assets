Beware of False Prophets.-- In these days of peril we are not to accept everything that men bring to us as truth. As professed teachers from God come to us declaring that they have a message from God, it is proper to inquire carefully, How do we know that this is truth? Jesus has told us that \"false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many.\" But we need not be deceived; for the Word of God gives us a test whereby we may know what is truth. The prophet says, \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\"", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 951}
