{"word": "The blessed Bible gives us a knowledge of the great plan of salvation, and shows us how every individual may have eternal life. Who is the author of the book? -- Jesus Christ. He is the True Witness, and He says to His own, \"I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.\" The Bible is to show us the way to Christ, and in Christ eternal life is revealed. \n                                                                           309\nJesus said to the Jews and to those who pressed about Him in great multitudes, \"Search the Scriptures.\" The Jews had the word in the Old Testament, but they had so mingled it with human opinions, that its truths were mystified, and the will of God to man was covered up. The religious teachers of the people are following their example in this age.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 308}
