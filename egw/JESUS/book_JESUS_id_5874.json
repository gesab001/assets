{"word": "483\n     As the books of record are opened in the Judgment, the lives of all who have believed on Jesus come in review before God. Beginning with those who first lived upon the earth, our Advocate presents the cases of each successive generation, and closes with the living. Every name is mentioned, every case closely investigated. Names are accepted, names rejected. When any have sins remaining upon the books of record, unrepented of and unforgiven, their names will be blotted out of the book of life, and the record of their good deeds will be erased from the book of God's remembrance. The Lord declared to Moses, \\93Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.\\94 [Exodus 32:33.] And says the prophet Ezekiel, \\93When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, . . . all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned.\\94 [Ezekiel 18:24.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 483}
