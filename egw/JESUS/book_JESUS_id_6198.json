{"word": "93\nTHOSE THE REDEEMED HAVE TAUGHT ABOUT JESUS.\\97The redeemed will meet and recognize those whose attention they have directed to the uplifted Saviour. What blessed converse they have with these souls! \\93I was a sinner,\\94 it will be said, \\93without God and without hope in the world, and you came to me and drew my attention to the precious Saviour as my only hope.\\94 . . . Others will say, \\93I was a heathen in heathen lands. You left your friends and comfortable home and came to teach me how to find Jesus and believe in Him as the only true God. I demolished my idols and worshiped God, and now I see Him face to face. I am saved, eternally saved, ever to behold Him whom I love.\\94RH January 5, 1905 quoted in ML 353.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 93}
