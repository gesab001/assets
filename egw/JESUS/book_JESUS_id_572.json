{"word": "Chap. Forty-Six - Evils of Indulgence\n\n     True Love Is Not Indulgent.--Love is the key to a child's heart, but the love that leads parents to indulge their children in unlawful desires is not a love that will work for their good. The earnest affection which springs from love to Jesus will enable parents to exercise judicious authority and to require prompt obedience. The hearts of parents and children need to be welded together, so that as a family they may be a channel through which wisdom, virtue, forbearance, kindness, and love may flow.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 271}
