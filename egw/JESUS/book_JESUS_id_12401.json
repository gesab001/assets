{"word": "Besides the written word, Jesus studied the book of nature, finding delight in the beautiful things of his own creation. He was in sympathy with humanity in all its varied joys and sorrows. He identified himself with all,--with the weak and helpless, the lowly, the needy, and the afflicted. In his teaching, he drew his illustrations from the great treasury of household ties and affections, and from nature. The unknown was illustrated by the known; sacred and divine truths, by natural, earthly things, with which the people were most familiar. These were the things that would speak to their hearts and make the deepest impression on their minds.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 64}
