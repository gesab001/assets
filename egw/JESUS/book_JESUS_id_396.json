{"word": "Chap. Eighty-Seven - Pen Pictures of the New Earth\n\n     Visions of Future Glory.--With Jesus at our head we all descended from the city down to this earth, on a great and mighty mountain, which could not bear Jesus up, and it parted asunder, and there was a mighty plain. Then we looked up and saw the great city, with twelve foundations and twelve gates, three on each side, and an angel at each gate. We all cried out, \"The city, the great city, it's coming, it's coming down from God out of heaven!\" And it came and settled on the place where we stood. Then we began to look at the glorious things outside of the city. There I saw most glorious houses, that had the appearance of silver, supported by four pillars set with pearls most glorious to behold. These were to be inhabited by the saints. In each was a golden shelf. I saw many of the saints go into the houses, take off their glittering crowns and lay them on the shelf, then go out into the field by the houses to do something with the earth; not as we have to do with the earth here--no, no. A glorious light shone all about their heads, and they were continually shouting and offering praises to God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AH", "page": 546}
