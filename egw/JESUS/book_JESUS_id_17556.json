Therefore Jesus was \\93in all points tempted like as we are\\94 (Hebrews 4:15). He endured every trial to which we are subject. And He exercised in His own behalf no power that is not freely offered to us. As man, He met temptation, and overcame in the strength given Him from God. He says, \\93I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart\\94 (Psalm 40:8).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 55}
