{"word": "In the warning to \"watch and pray,\" Jesus has indicated the only safe course. There is need of watchfulness. Our own hearts are deceitful; we are compassed with the weaknesses and frailties of humanity, and Satan is intent to destroy. We may be off our guard, but our adversary is never idle. Knowing his tireless vigilance, let us not sleep, as do others, but \"watch and be sober.\" The spirit and influence of the world must be met, but they must not be allowed to take possession of the mind and heart.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 409}
