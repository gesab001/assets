For the time will come when they will not endure \n                                                                           17\nsound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.\" [2 Timothy 4:1-5.] In this charge every minister has his work outlined,--a work that he can do only through the fulfilment of the promise that Jesus gave to His disciples, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end.\" [Matthew 28:20.]", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW", "page": 16}
