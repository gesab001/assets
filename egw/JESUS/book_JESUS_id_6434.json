{"word": "Jesus presented the Father as one to whom we could give our confidence and present our wants. When we are in terror of God, and overwhelmed with the thought of His glory and majesty, the Father points us to Christ as His representative. What you see revealed in Jesus, of tenderness, compassion, and love, is the reflection of the attributes of the Father. The cross of Calvary reveals to man the love of God.

By the mouth of the prophet He said, \"I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee\" (Jeremiah 31:3).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 18}
