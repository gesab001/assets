{"word": "You are reproducing your own character in others. You may express many things that will create in other minds a course of thought which will lead them into false paths.

You may outlive your doubts, and through repentance toward God and faith in Jesus Christ escape from the snare of the fowler.

Here is a harvest some must reap. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 137}
