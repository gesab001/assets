{"word": "176\nJESUS\\92 DISCIPLES WERE IMPRESSED BY HIS PRAYER HABITS.\\97\\93The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\\94 Not for Himself, but for others, He lived and thought and prayed. From hours spent with God He came forth morning by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. Daily He received a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit. In the early hours of the new day the Lord awakened Him from His slumbers, and His soul and His lips were anointed with grace, that He might impart to others. His words were given Him fresh from the heavenly courts, words that He might speak in season to the weary and oppressed. \\93The Lord God hath given me,\\94 He said, \\93the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 176}
