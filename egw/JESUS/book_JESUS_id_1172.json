{"word": "\"And,\" said my father, warming with his subject, \"the inspired Paul wrote a letter to encourage his brethren in Thessalonica, saying: 'To you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power; when He shall come to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all them that believe . . . in that day.' 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10. 'For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\n44\nWherefore comfort one another with these words.' 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 43}
