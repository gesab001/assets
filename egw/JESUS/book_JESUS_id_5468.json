{"word": "Take up the work anywhere and everywhere. Do that which is the nearest you, right at your own doors, however humble and uncommended it may seem. Work only for the glory of God and the good of men. Let self sink out of sight, while with earnest purpose and solemn prayers of faith you work for Him who has died that you might live. Go to your neighbors one by one, and come close to them till their hearts are warmed by your unselfish interest and love. Sympathize with them, pray for them, watch for opportunities to do them good, and as you can, gather a few together and open the word of God to their darkened minds. Keep watching, as he who must render an account for the souls of men, and make the most of the privileges that God \n337\ngives you of laboring with him in his vineyard. Do not neglect speaking to your neighbors, and doing them all the kindness in your power, that you may \\93by all means save some.\\94 [1 Corinthians 9:22.] We need to seek for the spirit that constrained the apostle Paul to go from house to house, pleading with tears, and teaching \\93repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\\94 [Acts 20:21.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 336}
