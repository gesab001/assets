{"word": "We should not try to lessen our guilt by excusing sin. We must accept God\\92s estimate of sin, and that is heavy indeed. Calvary alone can reveal the terrible enormity of sin. If we had to bear our own guilt, it would crush us. But the sinless One has taken our place; though undeserving, He has borne our iniquity. \\93If we confess our sins,\\94 God \\93is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\\94 1 John 1:9. Glorious truth!\\97just to His own law, and yet the Justifier of all that believe in Jesus. \\93Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth not His anger forever, because He delighteth in mercy.\\94 Micah 7:18.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 299}
