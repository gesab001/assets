{"word": "We must, if we overcome, use the means placed within our reach. We must put on the Lord Jesus Christ. By faith we must clothe ourselves with the righteousness of Christ and put no confidence in our own merits. Many are seeking to be present at the marriage supper of the Lamb in their own citizen's dress, discarding the robe woven in the loom of heaven and prepared for all at infinite cost, as a free gift to His guests that shall eat of His supper. We must wear the livery of heaven. We must be clothed in Christ's righteousness and go to warfare at His expense and under His bloodstained banner, or we are none of His.--Manuscript 41, Oct. 9, 1890, \"Diary: Labors at Adam's Center.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 296}
