{"word": "O that the bowed head might be lifted, that the eyes might be opened to behold Him, that the ears might listen to His voice! \"Go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen.\" . . . Mourn not as those who are hopeless and helpless. Jesus lives, and because He lives we shall live also. From grateful hearts, from lips touched with holy fire, let the glad song ring out, Christ is risen! He lives to make intercession for us.

Believe, and thou shalt see the glory of God. \n                                                                           184", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 183}
