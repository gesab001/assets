{"word": "Those who profess to be Christians, but do not follow in the footsteps of Christ, make of none effect His words, and obscure the plan of salvation. By their spirit and deportment they virtually say, \"Jesus, in Your day You did not understand as well as we do in our day, that man can serve God and mammon.\" These professors of religion claim to keep the law of God, but they do not keep it. Oh, what would the standard of true manhood have become had it been left in the hands of man! God has lifted His own standard--the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus; and the experience that follows complete surrender to God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.--Review and Herald, Aug. 19, 1890.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 65}
