{"word": "This incident is full of instruction. Jesus, the world\\92s Redeemer, is drawing close to the time when He will give His life for a sinful world.

But Christ could appreciate the gift as an expression of her love, and Mary\\92s heart was filled with perfect peace and happiness.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 252}
