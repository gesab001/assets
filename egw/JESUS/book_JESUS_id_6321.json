{"word": "Oh, my brethren, put on the whole armor of God, and move with wisdom and intelligence. Do not work weeks and months to bring around a condition of things that will bind you hand and foot so that you cannot engage in the warfare as bold soldiers of Jesus Christ, and then mourn and complain because your circumstances are such that you cannot give yourselves wholly to the work. It is not God who lays upon you this burden. He has given you reason, and he wants you to use it. He would not have you arrange things at home so that when you go out to labor your minds will be continually upon your families. Before you make any move with reference to your families, he would have you consider carefully whether you are piling up burdens that will hinder you from engaging in his work. I have felt sad as I have heard different individuals tell how difficult it was for them to give themselves to the work of God. They do not like to consider the steps that they have taken to place themselves in this position. If God should work a miracle to bring them out of this position, they would go right to work to bring about another similar state of things. Such do not feel the necessity of counseling with God; they prefer to follow their own inclination and judgment.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 128}
