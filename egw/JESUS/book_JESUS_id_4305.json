{"word": "It is because of the directions I have received from the Lord that I have the courage to stand among you and speak as I do, notwithstanding the way in which you may look at the medical missionary work. I wish to say that the medical missionary work is God's work. The Lord wants every one of His ministers to come into line. Take hold of the medical missionary work, and it will give you access to the people. Their hearts will be touched as you minister to their necessities. \n                                                                           524\nAs you relieve their sufferings, you will find opportunity to speak to them of the love of Jesus.--Counsels on Health, p. 533.
