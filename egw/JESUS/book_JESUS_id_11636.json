{"word": "(Acts 4:12; Hebrews 7:25; 9:22; 1 John 1:7-9.) Faith in the Blood of Christ.--God is approached through Jesus Christ, the Mediator, the only way through which He forgives sins. God cannot forgive sins at the expense of His justice, His holiness, and \n                                                                           913\nHis truth. But He does forgive sins and that fully. There are no sins He will not forgive in and through the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the sinner's only hope, and if he rests here in sincere faith, he is sure of pardon and that full and free. There is only one channel and that is accessible to all, and through that channel a rich and abundant forgiveness awaits the penitent, contrite soul and the darkest sins are forgiven.", "paragraph": 9, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 912}
