{"word": "Every soul is under obligation to live a Christian life. Our individuality, our talents, our time, our influence, our abilities, all given to us of God, are to be rendered back to Him in willing service. The aim and object of life is not to secure temporal advantages, but to make sure of the eternal advantages. God claims your soul, your body, your capabilities; for He has bought them by His own precious blood, and they all belong to Him. It is robbery to withhold yourself from God. . . . The question of importance to us is, Is our life interwoven with that of Jesus?", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 30}
