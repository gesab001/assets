{"word": "Smoking Clergymen.--How many there are who minister in the sacred desk, in Christ's stead, and are beseeching men to be reconciled to God, and are exalting the free gospel, who are themselves slaves to appetite, and are defiled with tobacco. They are daily weakening their nerve brain power by the use of a filthy narcotic. And these men profess to be ambassadors for the holy Jesus.--Health Reformer, December, 1871.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 69}
