All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works; for they say, and do not.\" The scribes and Pharisees claimed to be invested with divine authority similar to that of Moses. They assumed to take his place as expounders of the law and judges of the people. As such they claimed all deference and obedience from the people. But Jesus admonished his hearers to do that which the priests taught according to the law; but not to follow their example; for they neglected the duties which they taught others to observe.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 58}
