{"word": "Argumentative Sermons \n\n     The many argumentative sermons preached, seldom soften and subdue the soul. . . . It should be the burden of every messenger to set forth the fullness of Christ. When the free gift of Christ's righteousness is not presented, the discourses are dry and spiritless; the sheep and lambs are not fed. Said Paul, \"My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power\" (1 Corinthians 2:4). There is marrow and fatness in the gospel. Jesus is the living center of everything. Put Christ into every sermon. Let the preciousness, mercy, and glory of Jesus Christ be dwelt upon; for Christ formed within is the hope of glory.--Letter 15, 1892.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 158}
