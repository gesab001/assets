{"word": "Then I feel so intensely for souls who are willfully departing from light and knowledge and obedience to God\\92s holy law. As Adam and Eve believed the lie of Satan, \\93Ye shall be as gods,\\94 so these souls hope through disobedience to rise to greater heights, to gain some flattering position. I am so anxious that, while others are sleeping, I spend hours in prayer that God will work in mighty power to break the fatal deception upon human minds and lead them in simplicity to the cross of Calvary. Then I quiet myself with the thought that all these souls are purchased by the blood of the Lord Jesus. We may have love for these souls, but Calvary testifies how God loves them. This work is not ours, but the Lord\\92s.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 17}
