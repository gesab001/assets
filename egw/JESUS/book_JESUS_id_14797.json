{"word": "Christ is the source of our strength. He is the Vine, we are the branches. We must receive nourishment from the living Vine. Deprived of the strength and nourishment of that Vine, we are as members of the body without a head and are in the very position which Satan wishes us to be in, that he may control us as pleases himself. He works \"with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.\" Spiritualism is a lie. It is founded upon the great original lie, \"Ye shall not surely die.\" Thousands cut off the Head, and the result is the members act without Jesus for their head, and another guides the body. Satan controls them.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1T", "page": 301}
