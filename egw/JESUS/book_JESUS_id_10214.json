{"word": "We are all sinful, and of ourselves are unable to do the words of Christ. But God has made provision whereby the condemned sinner may be freed from spot and stain. \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\" \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" But while Christ saves the sinner, He does not do away with the law which condemns the sinner....The law shows us our sins, as a mirror shows us that our face is not clean. The mirror has no power to cleanse the face; that is not its office.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 55}
