{"word": "Those who read and listen to the sophistries that prevail in this age do not know God as He is. They contradict the Word of God, and extol and worship nature in the place of the Creator. While we may discern the workings of God in the things He has created, these things are not God. . . . The physical creation testifies of God and Jesus Christ as the great Creator of all things. \"All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men\" (John 1:3, 4). The psalmist bears witness, \"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard\" (Psalm 19:1-3). . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 278}
