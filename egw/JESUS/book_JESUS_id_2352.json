{"word": "For twelve years of His life He had walked the streets of Nazareth, and worked with Joseph at his trade, carefully performing the duties that devolved upon a son. Hitherto He had not given indications of His peculiar character, or made manifest the nature of His mission to earth as the Son of God. But upon this occasion He made known to His parents the fact that He had a higher, holier mission to perform than they thought, for He had a work to do which had been committed to Him by His heavenly Father. Mary knew that\n53\nJesus had disclaimed relationship to Joseph, and claimed His sonship to the Eternal. She was perplexed; she did not fully comprehend the meaning of the words herself when He referred to His mission. She questioned in her mind as to whether anyone had told Jesus that Joseph was not His true father, but that God was His Father. Mary pondered these things in her heart.--YI, July 13, 1893.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 52}
