The word of God has denounced it: no drunkard shall enter the kingdom of God. What would you recommend to cure such an appetite? You would not say, \"You may use strong drink moderately. Continue within bounds, but never indulge to excess.\" You would rather say, \"There is no such thing as helping you unless you co-operate fully with my efforts, and sign the pledge of total abstinence.
