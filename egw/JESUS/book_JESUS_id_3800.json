{"word": "Being confident of this very thing, that He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. . . . Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; and in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake. Philippians 1:6, 27-29.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 26}
