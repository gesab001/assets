{"word": "STRENGTH TO OVERCOME TEMPTATION GIVEN TO THOSE WHO PRAY.\\97All are accountable for their actions while in this world upon probation. All have power to control their actions if they will. If they are weak in virtue and purity of thoughts and acts, they can obtain help from the Friend of the helpless. Jesus is acquainted with all the weaknesses of human nature, and, if entreated, will give strength to overcome the most powerful temptations. All can obtain this strength if they seek for it in humility.\\97(Child Guidance, 466, 467.)", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 48}
