{"word": "When Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted, He was led by the Spirit of God. He did not invite temptation. He went into the wilderness to be alone, to contemplate His mission and work. By fasting and prayer He was to brace Himself for the bloodstained path He must travel. But Satan knew that the Saviour had gone into the wilderness, and he thought this was the best time to approach Him. Weak and emaciated from hunger, worn and haggard with mental agony, Christ\\92s \\93visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men.\\94 Now was Satan\\92s opportunity. Now he supposed that he could overcome Christ.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 192}
