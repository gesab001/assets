{"word": "\"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" With \n                                                                           173\nGod all things are possible. Truth, set home to the heart by the Spirit of God, will crowd out the love of riches. The love of Jesus and of riches cannot dwell in the same heart. The love of God so far surpasses the love of riches that the possessor breaks away from his riches and transfers his affections to God. Through love he is then led to minister to the wants of God's cause. It is his highest pleasure to make a right disposition of his Lord's goods. Love to God and his fellow men predominates, and he holds all that he has as not his own, and faithfully discharges his duty as God's steward. Then can he keep both the great commandments of the law: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\" \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" In this way it is possible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. \"And everyone that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1T", "page": 172}
