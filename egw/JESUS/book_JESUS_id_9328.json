{"word": "\"Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge\"--knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus, knowledge of the great plan of salvation. To be ignorant of God's commandments and laws will not excuse a soul. He will not dare to plead around the throne of God, \"I did not know the truth. I was ignorant.\" The Lord has given His Word to be our guide, our instructor, and with this heavenly enlightening there is no excuse for ignorance. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 68}
