{"word": "Love Between the Father and the Son a Type.-- However much a shepherd may love his sheep, he loves his sons and daughters more. Jesus is not only our shepherd; He is our \"everlasting Father.\" And He says, \"I know Mine own, and Mine own know Me, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father\" (John 10:14, RV). What a statement is this!--the only-begotten Son, He who is in the bosom of the Father, He whom God has declared to be \"the man that is my fellow\" (Zechariah 13:7)--the communion between Him and the eternal God is taken to represent the communion between Christ and His children on the earth!--DA 483 (1898).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 250}
