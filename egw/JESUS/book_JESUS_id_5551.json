{"word": "There is a great work before us. The world is to be warned. This work calls for the exercise of all the talents that God has intrusted to our keeping. He has given us abilities that enable us to exert an influence on other minds. We have talents in the pen, the press, the voice, the purse, and the sanctified affections of the soul. All these talents are the Lord's. He has lent them to us, and he holds us responsible for the use we make of them,\\97for the faithful discharge of our duty to the world. We may come very near to Jesus; we may commune with him, and having found rest and peace to our own souls, we may show forth to others the beauties of true holiness.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 434}
