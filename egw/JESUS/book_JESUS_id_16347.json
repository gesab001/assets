{"word": "Point Souls to Christ \n\n     The servants of God who live in obedience to His requirements, who speak the truth in humility, will carry an influence with them which will work for the salvation of many souls. But we must not allow the people to hang helplessly upon us. We are human and finite. We must direct them to Christ, saying, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Jesus pleads the case of His colaborers, but every hour they need to feel humble dependence upon the Captain of their salvation, and through the intercession of Christ our Advocate many souls will be saved unto eternal life. The Lord has provided for the descent of the Holy Spirit upon His workers, and everyone who sincerely seeks God will find Him. We are to come boldly to the throne of grace, and seek the footstool of mercy. We are to believe that the Lord hears and answers our prayers. Our great High Priest who has passed into the heavens says, \"I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever.\" The Holy Spirit abides with consecrated laborers who in any locality are seeking to advance the cause. \n                                                                           219", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 218}
