{"word": "Our only safety is in being joined to the Lord Jesus Christ. We can afford to lose the friendship of worldly men. Those who join themselves to worldly men, that they may carry out their unsanctified purposes, make a fearful mistake; for they forfeit the favor and blessing of God. I am to urge upon the attention of our people that the Lord Himself has placed a wall of separation between the world and that which He has established on the earth. God's people are to serve Him, for Christ has called them out of the world, and sanctified and refined them, that they may do His service. . . . There is no such thing as maintaining concord between the profane and the holy. There can be no concord between Christ and Belial. But \"the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself\" (Psalm 4:3). And this consecration to the Lord, this separation from the world, is plainly declared and positively enjoined in both the Old and the New Testaments.--Letter 329, Dec. 11, 1905, to J. A. Burden, manager of the Loma Linda Sanitarium.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 354}
