{"word": "The truth in the heart will surely have a correcting influence on the character. Hold the truth as from God, as a treasure of the highest value, that must not be dimmed or tarnished by evil practices that are wholly out of harmony with its holy character. Under the divine influence of truth the mind will be strengthened, the intellect invigorated, and that which is useless will be discarded for that which is pure and beneficial. Under the influence of truth the Christian character will develop through the knowledge of the only true God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 233}
