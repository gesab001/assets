{"word": "He who receives Christ by faith is a member of the royal family, a child of the heavenly King, an heir of God and a joint-heir with Jesus Christ. His lot is a part of the cross of Christ. He is bound up with Christ for life and for death in the great plan of redemption. The full and entire renunciation of self that appeared in Christ appears also in him who is consecrated to Christ's service. He shows Christlike tenderness by speaking kind, gentle words, words which are full of comfort and hope and love. He is filled with an untold solicitude for human souls. He can say, \\93I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\\94 He is willing to make any sacrifice to draw lost, perishing souls to the cross of Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 88}
