{"word": "Those teachers who have not a progressive religious experience, who are not learning daily lessons in the school of Christ, that they may be ensamples to the flock, but who accept their wages as the main thing, are not fit for the solemn, awfully solemn, position they occupy. For this scripture is appropriate to all our schools established as God designed they should be, after the order or example of the schools of the prophets, imparting a higher class of knowledge--mingling not dross with the silver, and wine with water--which is a representation of precious principles. False ideas and unsound practises are leavening the pure, and corrupting that which should ever be kept pure, and looked upon by the world, by angels, and by men, as the Lord's institution--schools where the education to love and fear God is made first. \"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" \"Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being as ensamples to the flock.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 184}
