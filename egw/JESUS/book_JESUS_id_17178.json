{"word": "The Word of God is the great educating book. But while many claim to respect it, they place other books before it. The human reason is exalted above the divine. Must I speak out plainly, and bear a decided testimony? Had the Word of God been regarded as it ever should have been--as the voice of God to men, the source of all wisdom, all truth, all higher education-- children, youth, and parents would have made it not only their study, but their teacher and their guide, that \"in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus\" (Ephesians 2:7). . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 127}
