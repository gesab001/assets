{"word": "\"The Lord Strengthens Me\" \n\n     July 7, 1892.  The Lord strengthens me by His grace to write important letters.  The brethren frequently come to me for counsel.  I feel a strong assurance that this tedious affliction is for the glory of the Lord.  I will not murmur; for when I wake in the night, it seems that Jesus is looking upon me.  The fifty-first chapter of Isaiah is exceedingly precious to me.  He bears all our burdens.  I read this chapter with assurance and hope.  -- Ms 19, 1892.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "RY", "page": 140}
