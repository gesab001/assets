{"word": "I tell you that which I have not spoken of or written to any other human being. A change must come to you through the moving, melting love of God, a change that will enable you to carry the credentials that you are one who loves souls. I think I have spoken so plainly that you will seek to learn of Christ His ways and methods, and seek to bring more of the sunshine and joy of the truth, the brightness of the Sun of Righteousness, into your own individual experience. Let your own heart break; let the routine and precision be broken down. Look unto Jesus, and not to men, to be told what to do. Catch the divine light from the Light of the world, and flash it upon the pathway of others in shaping and moulding the work in Africa.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 73}
