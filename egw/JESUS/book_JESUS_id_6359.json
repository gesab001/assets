{"word": "As you go to your homes, be sure that you do not leave Jesus behind. You remember how, when he was twelve years old, his parents took him with them up to Jerusalem to attend the passover. But in returning with the crowd, they allowed their attention to be so engrossed with talking and visiting that they entirely neglected their sacred trust, and Jesus was left behind. For an entire day he was not brought to mind by those who should not have forgotten him for a moment. By only one day's neglect they lost Jesus from their company; but it cost them three days of anxious search to find him. So with Christians; if they become careless, and neglect to watch and pray; they may in one day lose Christ, but it may take many days of anxious, sorrowful search to find him, and to regain the peace of mind which was lost by vain talking, or neglect of prayer. When Christians associate together, there is need of carefulness in all their words and actions, lest Jesus be forgotten, and they pass along unmindful of the fact that he is not among them.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 145}
