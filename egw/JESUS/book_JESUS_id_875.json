{"word": "The enemies of Jesus vented their rage upon Him as He hung upon the cross. Priests, rulers, and scribes joined with the mob in mocking the dying Saviour. At the baptism and at the transfiguration the voice of God had been heard proclaiming Christ as His Son. Again, just before Christ\\92s betrayal, the Father had spoken, witnessing to His divinity.

Alone He suffered abuse and mockery from wicked men.\\97Ibid., p. 746.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 278}
