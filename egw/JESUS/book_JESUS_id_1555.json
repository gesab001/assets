{"word": "On the way to the centurion's home, Jesus receives a message from the officer himself, \"Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.\" Still the Saviour keeps on His way, and the centurion comes in person to complete the message, saying, \"Neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee,\" \"but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\" . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CC", "page": 296}
