{"word": "Last night I was awake for a long time. I was troubled and anxious; for I knew that some were tempted and tried, and I was wondering how I could help them to look to Jesus and comfort their hearts in His love. I thought, If I could only take hold of Christ's hand and hear His voice, as I lie awake, praying for myself, and much more for others who are tempted and tried! I could not sleep after one o'clock. I was so sorry, because I had writing that I wanted to do today, and I thought that I would be useless if I could not sleep. But at two o'clock I arose and dressed, made my fire, and before breakfast had written many pages. I have written many pages since breakfast, and have not felt sleepy at all.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 44}
