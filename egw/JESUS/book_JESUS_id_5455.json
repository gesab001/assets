{"word": "The advocates of truth must hide in Jesus. He is their greatness, their power and efficiency. They \n310\nmust represent Christ, love souls as he loved them, be obedient as he was, be courteous, full of sympathy. Let Christ appear, and self be hid in him. Now, as in the days of Christ, traditional prejudice, custom and fashion, have barricaded souls against the truth. He who presents the truth to others must in his own character give evidence of its transforming power.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 309}
