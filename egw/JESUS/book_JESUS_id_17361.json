{"word": "We need daily to uplift the soul heavenward, catching the bright beams of light from the Sun of Righteousness. Hath God forgotten to be gracious to His people who fear Him, who love Him? No. Hath He shut up His tender mercies that they can no longer reach His tried and tempted ones? I tell you, nay. Look up, trembling, doubting souls. Look up to the face of Jesus Christ, beaming with love upon the purchase of His blood, and doubt no more.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 364}
