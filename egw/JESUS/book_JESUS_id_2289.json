{"word": "Unity on the Fundamental Truths.--We are one in faith in the fundamental truths of God's word. And one object must be kept in view constantly; that is, harmony and co-operation must be maintained without compromising one principle of truth. And while constantly digging for the truth as for hidden treasure, be careful how you open new and conflicting opinions. We have a world-wide message. The commandments of God and the testimonies of Jesus Christ are the burden of our work. To have unity and love for one another is the great [work] now to be carried on. There is danger of our ministers' dwelling too much on doctrines, preaching altogether too many discourses on argumentative subjects when their own soul needs practical godliness.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CW", "page": 79}
