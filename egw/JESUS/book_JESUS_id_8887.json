{"word": "True wisdom is a treasure as lasting as eternity. Many of the world\\92s so-called wise men are wise only in their own estimation. Content with the acquisition of worldly wisdom, they never enter the garden of God, to become acquainted with the treasures of knowledge contained in His holy Word. Supposing themselves to be wise, they are ignorant concerning the \n31\nwisdom which all must have who gain eternal life....The unlearned man, if he knows God and Jesus Christ, has a more enduring wisdom than has the most learned man who despises the instruction of God.", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 30}
