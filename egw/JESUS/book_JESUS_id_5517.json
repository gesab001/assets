Jesus did not remain in heaven, away from the sorrowing and sinful, but he came down to this world that he might become acquainted with the weakness, the suffering and temptations, of the fallen race. He reached us where we were, that he might lift us up. Such should be our work. We must come to the youth where they are, and make their case our own, if we would benefit them. If these youthful disciples are overcome by temptation, I hope that you who are older in experience will not deal with them harshly, or regard their efforts with indifference. Remember that you, yourselves, have shown but little strength to resist the tempter's power. Be as patient with these lambs of the flock as you wish others to be with you. God has so constituted us that even the strongest desire sympathy. How much more, then, do children need it. Even a look of compassion will often soothe and strengthen the tried and tempted child.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 407}
