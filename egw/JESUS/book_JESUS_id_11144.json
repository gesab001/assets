{"word": "Christ is the uniting link in the golden chain which binds believers together in God. There must be no separating in this great testing time. The people of God are, \"fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord\" (verses 19-21). The children of God constitute one united whole in Christ, who presents His cross as the center of attraction. All who believe are one in Him.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 21}
