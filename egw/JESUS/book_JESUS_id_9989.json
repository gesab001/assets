{"word": "JESUS HEARS THE SIMPLE PRAYER FOR FORGIVENESS.\\97It is not essential that all shall be able to specify to a certainty when their sins were forgiven. The lesson to be taught the children is that their errors and mistakes are to be brought to Jesus in their very childhood of life. Teach them to ask His forgiveness daily for any wrong that they have done, and that Jesus does hear the simple prayer of the penitent heart, and will pardon, and receive them, just as He received the children brought to Him when He was upon earth.\\97(Child Guidance, 494, 495.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 241}
