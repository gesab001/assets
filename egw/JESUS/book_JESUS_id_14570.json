{"word": "Jesus is coming, but not as at his first Advent, a babe in Bethlehem, not as he rode into Jerusalem, when the disciples praised God with a loud voice and cried, Hosannah; but in the glory of the Father, and with all the retinue of holy angels with him, to escort him on his way to earth. All heaven will be emptied of the angels. While the waiting saints will be looking for him, and gazing into heaven, as were the \"men of Galilee\" when he ascended from the Mount of Olivet. Then, those only who are holy, those who have followed fully the meek Pattern will, with rapturous joy, exclaim as they behold him, \"Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us.\" And they will be changed \"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump,\" that wakes the sleeping saints, and calls them forth from their dusty beds, clothed with glorious immortality, shouting, Victory! Victory! over death and the grave. The changed saints are caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air, never more to be separated from the object of their love.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ExV54", "page": 29}
