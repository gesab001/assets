{"word": "Chap. 29 - The Sabbath: Guiding Principles in Sabbath Obervance\n-\n\n     The Sabbath a Sign to the World of Loyalty.-- From the pillar of cloud Jesus \"spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you\" (Exodus 31:12, 13). The Sabbath is a pledge given by God to man--a sign of the relation existing between the Creator and His created beings. By observing the memorial of the creation of the world in six days and the rest of the Creator on the seventh day, by keeping the Sabbath holy, according to His directions, the Israelites were to declare to the world their loyalty to the only true and living God, the Sovereign of the universe.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 256}
