{"word": "The test of a genuine Christian is given in the Word of God. Says Jesus, \\93If ye love me, keep my commandments\\94 (John 14:15). \\93He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. . . . If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father\\92s which sent me\\94 (verses 21-24).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 45}
