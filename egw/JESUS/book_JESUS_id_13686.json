{"word": "Before the ransomed throng is the holy city. Jesus opens wide the pearly gates, and the nations that have kept the truth enter in. There they behold the Paradise of God, the home of Adam in his innocency. Then that voice, richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear, is heard, saying, \"Your conflict is ended.\" The Saviour's countenance beams with unutterable love as he welcomes the redeemed to the joy of their Lord.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 465}
