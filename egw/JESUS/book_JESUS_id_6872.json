{"word": "\\93Among the Methodists I had heard much in regard to sanctification. I had seen people lose their physical strength under the influence of strong mental excitement, and had heard this pronounced to be the evidence of sanctification. But I could not comprehend what was necessary in order to be fully consecrated to God. My Christian friends said to me: \\91Believe in Jesus now! Believe that he accepts you now!\\92 This I tried to do but found it impossible to believe that I had received a blessing which, it seemed to me, should electrify my whole being. I wondered at my own hardness of heart in being unable to experience the exaltation of spirit that orthers manifested. It seemed to me that I was different from them, and forever shut out from the perfect joy of holiness of heart.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LS80", "page": 150}
