{"word": "God Feeding Earth's Millions \n\n     In feeding the five thousand, Jesus lifts the veil from the world of nature, and reveals the power that is constantly exercised for our good. In the production of earth's harvests, God is working a miracle every day. Through natural agencies the same work is accomplished that was wrought in the feeding of the multitude. Men prepare the soil and sow the seed, but it is the life from God that causes the seed to germinate. It is God's rain and air and sunshine that cause it to put forth \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" It is God who is every day feeding millions from earth's harvest fields.-- D.A. 367.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 8}
