{"word": "God is moving upon every mind that is open to receive the impressions of His Holy Spirit. He is sending out messengers that they may give the warnings in every locality. God is testing the devotion of His churches, and their willingness to render obedience to the Spirit's guidance. Knowledge is to be increased. The messengers of heaven are to be seen running to and fro, seeking in every way possible to warn the people of the coming judgments, and presenting the glad tidings of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. The standard of righteousness is to be exalted.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 183}
