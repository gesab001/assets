{"word": "Let us have more confidence in our Redeemer. Turn not from the waters of Lebanon to seek refreshment at broken cisterns, which can hold no water. Have faith in God. Trustful dependence on Jesus makes victory not only possible but certain. Though multitudes are pressing on in the wrong way, though the outlook be ever so discouraging, yet we may have full assurance in our Leader; for \"I am God,\" He declares, \"and there is none else\" (Isaiah 45:22). He is infinite in power, and able to save all who come to Him. There is no other in whom we can safely trust.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 17}
