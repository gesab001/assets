{"word": "The common, severe, harsh words that come from your lips so readily must be withheld and the Spirit of God speak through the human agent. By beholding the character of Christ you will become changed into His likeness. The grace of Christ alone can change your heart, and then you will reflect the image of the Lord Jesus. God calls upon us to be like Him--pure, holy, and undefiled. We are to bear the divine image.--Lt 84, 1899. (3BC 1164.)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 578}
