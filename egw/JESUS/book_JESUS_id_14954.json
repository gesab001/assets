{"word": "You should not be easily provoked. Let not your heart become selfish, but let it expand with love. You have a work to do which you must not neglect. Endure hardship as a good soldier. Jesus is acquainted with every conflict, every trial, and every pang of anguish. He will help you; for He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet He sinned not. Go to Him, dear boy, with your burdens. Take no one into your confidence, and tell no one your difficulties, but us. Make Jesus your Burden Bearer, and seek a more thorough experience in religious things. God help and bless you, is my sincere prayer.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2T", "page": 313}
