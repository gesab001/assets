{"word": "A Work of the Highest Importance \n\n     To mold and fashion the character of children and youth is a work of the very highest importance, and in this work it is essential to present Christ in His matchless love to the mind, that His counter and stronger charms may eclipse the attractions of the world. The youth must not merely see a theory, however logical, but the loving character and glory of Christ. They must be led to behold the riches of the eternal world, until they are encouraged, animated, and won. The love of Jesus must be the motive of all effort. It impels, its constrains, it captivates. --TSS 101-105.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 52}
