{"word": "There are those who associate together to do evil and seem to think in this they lose their individual responsibility. But God holds them accountable for every act performed that has the slightest tendency to counteract the work of Christ; whether they are united with many or with the few, the sin is the same. We are individually responsible. We ourselves should be our concern. Are we in all our words and actions building up the kingdom of Christ, or are we tearing down? Christ says to each one of us, \"Follow me.\" Then let us be found followers of Jesus Christ.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 303}
