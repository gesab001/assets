{"word": "Take God's word on trust, saying, He loves me: He gave His life for me; and He will save me. . . . Look away from yourself to Jesus. Embrace Him as your Saviour. Cease to bemoan your helpless condition. Looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith, you will be inspired with hope and will see the salvation of God. When you feel tempted to mourn, force your lips to utter the praises of God. \"Rejoice in the Lord alway\" (Philippians 4:4). Is He not worthy of praise? Then educate your lips to talk of His glory and to magnify His name. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 116}
