{"word": "GOD WELCOMES US TO HIS AUDIENCE CHAMBER.\\97We come to God by special invitation, and He waits to welcome us to His audience chamber. The first disciples who followed Jesus were not satisfied with a hurried conversation with Him by the way; they said, \\93Rabbi, . . . where dwellest Thou? . . . They came and saw where He dwelt, and abode with Him that day.\\94 John 1:38, 39. So we may be admitted into closest intimacy and communion with God. \\93He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.\\94 Psalm 91:1. Let those who desire the blessing of God knock and wait at the door of mercy with firm assurance, saying, For Thou, O Lord, hast said, \\93Everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\\94(Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, 131.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 9}
