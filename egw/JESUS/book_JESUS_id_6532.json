{"word": "It is a great thing to believe in Jesus. We hear many say, \"Believe, believe; all that you have to do is to believe in Jesus.\" But it is our privilege to inquire, What does this belief take in? and what does it comprehend? There are many of us who have a nominal faith but we do not bring that faith into our characters. . . . We must have that faith which works by love and purifies the soul, that this belief in Christ will lead us to put away everything that is offensive in His sight. Unless we have this faith that works, it is of no advantage to us. You may admit that Christ is the Saviour of the world, but is He your Saviour? Do you believe today that He will give you strength and power to overcome every defect in your character?. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 118}
