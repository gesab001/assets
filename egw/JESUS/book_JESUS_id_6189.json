{"word": "I saw that she was sealed and would come up at the voice of God and stand upon the earth, and would be with the 144,000. I saw we need not mourn for her; she would rest in the time of trouble, and all that we could mourn for was our loss in being deprived of her company. I saw her death would result in good.\\97Letter 10, 1850 quoted in 2SM 263. \nTHOSE WHO COME TO GOD IN FAITH.\\97God justly condemns all who do not make Christ their personal Saviour; but He pardons every soul who comes to Him in faith, and enables him to work the works of God, and through faith to be one with Christ. Jesus says of these, \\93I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one [this unity brings perfection of character]; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me\\94 (John 17:23).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 85}
