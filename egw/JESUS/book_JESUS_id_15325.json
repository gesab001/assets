{"word": "Said Christ: \"How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\" And His disciples were astonished at His doctrine. When a minister who has labored successfully in securing souls to Jesus Christ abandons his sacred work in order to secure temporal gain, he is called an apostate, and he will be held accountable to God for the talents that he has \n                                                                           469\nmisapplied. When men of business, farmers, mechanics, merchants, lawyers, etc., become members of the church, they become servants of Christ; and although their talents may be entirely different, their responsibility to advance the cause of God by personal effort, and with their means, is no less than that which rests upon the minister. The woe which will fall upon the minister if he preach not the gospel, will just as surely fall upon the businessman, if he, with his different talents, will not be a co-worker with Christ in accomplishing the same results. When this is brought home to the individual, some will say, \"This is an hard saying;\" nevertheless it is true, although continually contradicted by the practice of men who profess to be followers of Christ.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "4T", "page": 468}
