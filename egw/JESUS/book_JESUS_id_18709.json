{"word": "220\n \n\n \nFeeling the Need for the Spiritual Gifts\n\n     And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 1 Timothy 1:12-14.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 221}
