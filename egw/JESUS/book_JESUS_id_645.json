{"word": "People who are compelled by circumstances they cannot control\\97to be where wickedness, deep and pronounced, is all around them\\97may remember that God and the angels are with them. Their only safety is to keep looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith. Their father, mother, brothers, and sisters may be on the side of the enemy, but they have the assurance that they are guarded by the Lord. It may cost them their lives to stand for the truth, yet they will be saved when the wicked are destroyed. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 49}
