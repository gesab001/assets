{"word": "The second temptation was on the point of presumption. . . . Satan now supposes that he has met Jesus on His own ground. The wily foe himself presents words that proceeded from the mouth of God. He makes it evident that he is acquainted with the Scriptures. But when he quoted the promise \\93He shall give his angels charge over thee,\\94 he omitted the words \\93to keep thee in all thy ways,\\94 that is, in all the ways of God\\92s choosing. Jesus refused to go outside the path of obedience. He would not force Providence to come to His rescue, and thus fail of giving us an example of trust and submission. Never did He work a miracle in His own behalf. His wonderful works were all for the good of others. Jesus declared to Satan, \\93It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\\94 God will preserve all who walk in the path of obedience, but to depart from it is to venture on Satan\\92s ground. There we are sure to fall. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 194}
