{"word": "Parents should hang in memory's hall the precious sayings of Christ. The children will repeat the words they hear often on the parents' lips--of Christ, and faith, and truth. Precious truth may be spoken by children. Whole armies of children may come under Christ's banner as missionaries, even in their childhood years. Never repulse the desire of children to do something for Jesus. Never quench their ardor for working in some way for the Master. Children rightly educated will learn to love Jesus and to grieve if they think they have grieved the Saviour by any sin committed by them. Keep their hearts tender and sensitive by your own words and example.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 42}
