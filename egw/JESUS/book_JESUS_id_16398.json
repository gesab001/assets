{"word": "How many petty grievances man traces upon paper, and pours into the soul of his fellowmen! How unwise it is to perpetuate and communicate to others those things you had better have kept to yourself! Never trace a line of discouragement. If you do just as Jesus has told you to do, you will find help. \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" The Lord God has given abundant evidence of His willingness to carry our burdens. As you lift His burdens, He lifts you, and the burdens also. He invites all who labor and are heavy-laden, \"Come unto Me.\" You are not told that you must go around the world to tell your troubles and unload your burdens to your fellowmen. \"Lo, I am with you alway,\" Christ says, \"even unto the end of the world.\" \n                                                                           331", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 330}
