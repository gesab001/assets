{"word": "We say we do believe that Jesus Christ died, but is He your personal Saviour? Here is the faith part of it. . . . Do you grasp Him by the living hand of faith? Do you reach out your hand to Him and say, as did Peter, \"Save, Lord, or I perish\"? He will save you. You remember there the disciples were toiling with the ship, and they gave up all hope of reaching the land. While in their dread peril they see One coming toward them, stepping on the foam-crested billows as He would on solid earth, and they were afraid and said, \"It is a spirit\"; but Christ says, \"It is I, be not afraid.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 356}
