{"word": "Here Jesus exalted faith in contrast with doubt. He showed that the children of Israel would stumble because of their unbelief, which would lead to the rejection of great light and would result in their condemnation and overthrow. Thomas declared that he would not believe unless he put his finger into the prints of the nails and thrust his hand into the side of his Lord. Christ gave him the evidence he desired and then reproved his unbelief: \"Because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "4T", "page": 233}
