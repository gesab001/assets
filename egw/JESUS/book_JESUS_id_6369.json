{"word": "Whether you labor in public or private, you must expect to meet difficulties. \n152\nJesus found it difficult to reach the crowd; and when he labored personally, many turned from him because of the perversity of the human heart. When the rich young man, spoken of in our text, came to Christ to know what he should do to be saved, he turned away sorrowfully when told to go and sell all that he had, and he should have treasure in heaven. He had great possessions. Property was his idol; and he was sorrowful because he could not retain his idol and have heaven too.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 151}
