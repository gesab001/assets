{"word": "The knowledge and education of Nicodemus was considered great and deep, but Christ showed him that they were of no value with God. He must be born again. He must receive new ideas, and understand that God is in all true science. The Lord not only expects man to do his best, but to be learning and educating others. Then he can say, \"I know in whom I believe. Jesus is the Bread of Life. If I feed upon Him, I shall be one with Christ in God.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 231}
