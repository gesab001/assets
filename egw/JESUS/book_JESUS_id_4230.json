{"word": "Others are brought to Christ in a more gentle way. \"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\" You cannot see the operating agency, but you can see its effects. When Nicodemus said unto Jesus, \"How can these things be?\" Jesus said to him, \"Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?\" A teacher in Israel, a man among wise men, a man who supposed that he was able to comprehend the science of religion, and yet stumbling at the doctrine of conversion! He was not willing to admit truth, because he could not understand all that was connected with the operation of the power of God, and yet he accepted the facts of nature although he could not explain or even comprehend them. Like others of all ages, he was looking to forms and precise ceremonies as more essential to religion than the deep movements of the Spirit of God.-- Review and Herald, May 5, 1896.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 289}
