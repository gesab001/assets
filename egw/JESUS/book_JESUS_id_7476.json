{"word": "Christ could not help being bright and shining. His very work was to shine. I am come, He said, \"that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" In Me is no darkness at all. . . .

His great heart of love is longing to flood the soul with the bright beams of His righteousness (letter 153a, 1897). \n                                                                           222", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 221}
