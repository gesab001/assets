Let them take the Word of truth as the man of their counsel, and become skillful in the use of \"the sword of the Spirit.\" Satan is a wise general; but the humble, devoted soldier of Jesus Christ may overcome him. It is written of the victors, that \"they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony\" (Revelation 12:11).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 249}
