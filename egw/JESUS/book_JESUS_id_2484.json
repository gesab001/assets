{"word": "Brother Nelson, will you soften and subdue your nature?  You may become like Jesus and be His missionary, His helping hand. He never prompts you to be exacting, dictatorial, and severe toward the members\n189\nof your family and toward others with whom you associate. You can live this life only once. Will you not bring the pleasantness and the goodness of a perfect character into this life?  The Lord wants you to be good and to do good. We can individually make life what we please. If we choose, we can honor God by using aright the talent of speech.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 188}
