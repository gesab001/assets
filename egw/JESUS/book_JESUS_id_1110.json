{"word": "O, I so much wish that the Lord of heaven would open many eyes that are now blind, that they might see themselves as God sees them, and give to them a sense of the work to be done in the fields of labor. But I have no hope that all the appeals I make will avail, unless the Lord speaks to the soul and writes his requirements upon the tablets of the heart. Cannot every living human agent have a high and elevated sense of what it means to have a large and important field of home missionary work appointed to him, without the necessity of going to far-off lands? And while some must proclaim the message of mercy to them that are afar off, there are many who have to proclaim the message to those who are nigh. Our schools are to be educating schools to qualify youth to become missionaries both by precept and example. Let the one who is acting in the capacity of teacher ever bear in mind that these children and youth are the purchase of the blood of the Son of God. They must be led to believe in Christ as their personal Saviour. The name of each separate believer is graven on the palms of his hands. The Chief Shepherd is looking down from the heavenly sanctuary upon the sheep of his pasture. \"He calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out.\" [John 10:3.] \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\" [1 John 2:1.] O precious, blessed truth! He does not treat one case with indifference.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CE", "page": 158}
