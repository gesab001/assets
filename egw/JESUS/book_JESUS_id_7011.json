{"word": "\\93The waiting people of God approached the hour when they fondly hoped their joys would be complete in the coming of the Saviour. But the time again passed unmarked by the advent of Jesus. Mortality still clung to us, the effects of the curse were all around us. It was hard to take up the vexing cares of life that we thought had been laid down forever.

But we were surprised that we felt so free in the Lord, and were so strongly sustained by his strength and grace.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LS88", "page": 189}
