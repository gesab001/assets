{"word": "The central theme of the Bible, the theme about which every other in the whole book clusters, is the redemption plan, the restoration in the human soul of the image of God. From the first intimation of hope in the sentence pronounced in Eden to that last glorious promise of the Revelation, \"They shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads\" (Revelation 22:4), the burden of every book and every passage of the Bible is the unfolding of this wondrous theme--man's uplifting--the power of God, \"which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (1 Corinthians 15:57).", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 122}
