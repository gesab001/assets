{"word": "When Luther was accused of preaching novelties, he declared: \"These are not novelties that I preach. \n                                                                           214\nBut I affirm that the doctrines of Christianity have been lost sight of by those whose special duty it was to preserve them; by the learned, by the bishops. I doubt not indeed that the truth has still found an abode in some few hearts.\" \"Poor husbandmen and simple children in these days understand more of Jesus Christ than the pope, the bishops, or the doctors.\" When Wm. Miller was charged with showing contempt for the doctors of divinity, he pointed to the word of God as the standard by which all doctrines and theories must be tested; and, knowing that he had truth on his side, he went forward in his work undismayed.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 213}
