{"word": "The garden of the heart must be cultivated. The soil must be broken up by deep repentance for sin. Poisonous, Satanic plants must be uprooted. The soil once overgrown by thorns can be reclaimed only by diligent labor. So the evil tendencies of the natural heart can be overcome only by earnest effort in the name and strength of Jesus. The Lord bids us by His prophet, \\93Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.\\94\\93Sow to yourselves in righteousness; reap in \n24\nmercy.\\94 Jeremiah 4:3; Hosea 10:12. This work He desires to accomplish for us, and He asks us to co-operate with Him.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CSA", "page": 23}
