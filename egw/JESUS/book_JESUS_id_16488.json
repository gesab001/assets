{"word": "You must vary your labour, and not think there is only one way which must be followed at all times and in all places. Your ways may seem to you a success, but if you had used more tact, more of the heavenly wisdom, you would have seen much more good results from your work. Paul's manner was not to approach the Jews in a way to stir up their worst prejudice and run the risk of making them his enemies by telling them the first thing that they must believe in Jesus of Nazareth. But he dwelt upon the prophecies of the Old Testament Scriptures that testified of Christ, of His mission, and of His work. Thus he led them along step by step, showing them the importance of honouring the law of God. He gave due honour to the ceremonial law, showing that Christ was the One who instituted the whole Jewish economy in sacrificial service. And after dwelling upon these things and showing that he had a clear understanding of these matters, then he brought them down to the first advent of Christ, and showed that in the crucified Jesus every specification had been fulfilled.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 16}
