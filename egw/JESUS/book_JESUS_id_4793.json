{"word": "When we seek for appropriate language in which to describe the love of God, we find words too tame, too weak, too far beneath the theme, and we lay down our pen and say, \"No, it cannot be described.\" We can only do as did the beloved disciple, and say, \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" In attempting any description of this love, we feel \n                                                                           180\nthat we are as infants lisping their first words. Silently we may adore; for silence in this matter is the only eloquence. This love is past all language to describe. It is the mystery of God in the flesh, God in Christ, and divinity in humanity. Christ bowed down in unparalleled humility, that in His exaltation to the throne of God, He might also exalt those who believe in Him, to a seat with Him upon His throne. All who look upon Jesus in faith that the wounds and bruises that sin has made will be healed in Him, shall be made whole.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 179}
