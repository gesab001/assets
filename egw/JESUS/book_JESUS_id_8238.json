{"word": "Satan Responsible for Conception of a Harsh, Stern God.-- Satan led men to conceive of God as a being whose chief attribute is stern justice--one who is a severe judge, a harsh, exacting creditor. He pictured the Creator as a being who is watching with jealous eye to discern the errors and mistakes of men that He may visit judgments upon them. It was to remove this dark shadow, by revealing to the world the infinite love of God, that Jesus came to live among men.--SC 11 (1892).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 250}
