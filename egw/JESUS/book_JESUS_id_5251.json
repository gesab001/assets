{"word": "God's servants receive no honor or recognition from the world. Stephen was stoned because he preached Christ and Him crucified. Paul was imprisoned, beaten, stoned, and finally put to death, because he was a faithful messenger of God to the Gentiles. The apostle John was banished to the Isle of Patmos, \"for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ\" (Revelation 1:9.). These examples of human steadfastness in the might of divine power are a witness to the world of the faithfulness of God's promises, of His abiding presence and sustaining grace.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 280}
