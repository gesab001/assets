{"word": "I want to say to those who have been desponding, When Satan comes in to tempt you, and you have no evidence that the Lord accepts you, do not look to see how dark you are, but look up to the light. Begin to praise God for the plan of salvation, and hold every victory gained through Christ. As you repeat the confidence you have in Jesus, Satan will flee; for he cannot bear the name of Jesus. Thus, step by step, you can fight the fight of faith. Remember that Jesus has borne long with you, and he does not want you to be lost. He says, \\93Behold, I stand at the door, and knock. If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\\94 By this he shows that he wants to take possession of your hearts.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 141}
