Oh, how shall we succeed in setting forth before the world the deep, precious love of God? In no other way can we compass it than by exclaiming, \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God\" (1 John 3:1)! Let us say to sinners, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29)! By presenting Jesus as the representative of the Father, we shall be able to dispel the shadow that Satan has cast upon our pathway, in order that we shall not see the mercy and love of God's inexpressible love as manifested in Jesus Christ.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 384}
