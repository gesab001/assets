{"word": "During His ministry Jesus raised the dead to life. He raised the son of the widow of Nain and Jairus\\92 daughter and Lazarus. But these were not clothed with immortality. After they were raised they continued to be subject to death and decay. But those who came forth from the grave at Christ\\92s resurrection were raised to everlasting life. They were the multitude of captives who ascended with Him as trophies of His victory over death and the grave. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 286}
