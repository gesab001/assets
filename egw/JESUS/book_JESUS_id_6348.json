{"word": "The law of God is made void in the land, but here is a little company who have come out from the world and are standing in defense of that law. To these Jesus says, \\93Ye are the light of the world.\\94 Now, suppose that you keep your minds dwelling upon self and your darkness; how can you be the light of the world? You keep yourselves in darkness by looking at your own imperfections, instead of the willingness and power of Jesus to save to the uttermost all that come unto him in faith. You hug your darkness so close that there is no chance for the light to get in.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 141}
