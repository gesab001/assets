And when some were disposed to reject their counsel, and separate from them, they would say, \"Well, if they want to go off, let them go.\" While such a lack of the compassion and long-suffering and tenderness of Jesus was manifested by His professed followers, these poor, erring, inexperienced souls, buffeted by Satan, were certain to make shipwreck of faith. However great may be the wrongs and sins of the erring, our brethren must learn to manifest not only the tenderness of the Great Shepherd, but also His undying care and love for the poor, straying sheep. Our ministers toil and lecture week after week, and rejoice that a few souls embrace the truth; and yet brethren of a prompt, decided turn of mind may, in five minutes, destroy their work by indulging the feelings which prompt words like these: \"Well, if they want to leave us, let them go.\" \n                                                                           187", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 186}
