{"word": "John, exiled upon the Isle of Patmos, . . . hears a voice saying, \"I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last\" (Revelation 1:11). At the sound of the voice John falls down in astonishment as if dead. He is unable to bear the sight of the divine glory. But a hand raises John  up, and the voice he remembers as the voice of his Master. He is strengthened and can endure to talk with the Lord Jesus.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 360}
