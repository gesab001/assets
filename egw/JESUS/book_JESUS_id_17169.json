{"word": "Let the men who are engaged in the solemn work of bearing the last message to the world, heed the exhortation of Paul, \"Preach the Word.\" Not the science of phrenology, or the productions from human speculations, but listen to the words of inspiration addressed to Timothy: \"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables\" (2 Timothy 4:1-4). . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 119}
