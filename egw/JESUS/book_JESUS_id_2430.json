{"word": "The teachers must draw from the deep, central source of all moral and intellectual power, asking the Lord to give them the mind that was in Christ Jesus, that every case that calls for sympathy and help, in physical as well as in spiritual lines, may receive their attention. The great Teacher co-operates with all the efforts made to relieve suffering humanity. Teach the students to make a practical application of the lessons they have received. As they witness human woe, and the deep poverty of those they are trying to help, they will be stirred with compassion. Their hearts will be softened and subdued by the deep, holy principles revealed in the Word of God. The great Physician cooperates with every effort made in behalf of suffering humanity, to give health to the body and light and restoration to the soul.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 91}
