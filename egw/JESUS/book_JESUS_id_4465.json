{"word": "There is an evidence that is open to all--the most highly educated, and the most illiterate--the evidence of experience. God invites us to prove for ourselves the reality of His Word, the truth of His promises. He bids us \"taste and see that the Lord is good.\" Instead of depending upon the word of another, we are to taste for ourselves. . . . And as we draw near to Jesus, and rejoice in the fullness of His love, our doubt and darkness will disappear in the light of His presence.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 16}
