{"word": "We must have the buyers and the sellers cleared out of the soul temple, that Jesus may take up His abode within us. Now He stands at the door of the heart as a heavenly merchantman; He says, . . . \"Open unto me; buy of me the heavenly wares; buy of me the gold tried in the fire.\" Buy faith and love, the precious, beautiful attributes of our Redeemer. . . . He invites us to buy the white raiment, which is His glorious righteousness; and the eyesalve, that we may discern spiritual things. Oh, shall we not open the heart's door to this heavenly visitor?", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 350}
