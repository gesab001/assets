{"word": "While on earth there will be no escape from conflicts and temptations; but in every storm we have a sure refuge. Jesus has told us, \"In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\" The forces of Satan are marshaled against us, and we have to meet a diligent foe; but if we take heed to the admonition of Christ, we shall be safe. \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation\" (Matthew 26:41). There are foes to be resisted and overcome, but Jesus is by our side, ready to strengthen us for every attack. \"This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith\" (1 John 5:4).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 371}
