{"word": "Chap. 8 - Fully Prepared\n\n     Thorough Preparation.--Very much more efficient work can be done in the canvassing field than has yet been done. The canvasser should not rest satisfied unless he is constantly improving. He should make thorough preparation, but should not be content with a set form of words; he should give the Lord a chance to work with his efforts and impress his mind. The love of Jesus abiding in his heart will enable him to devise means to gain access to individuals and families.--Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 396. (1885)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CM", "page": 55}
