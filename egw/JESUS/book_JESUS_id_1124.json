{"word": "Christian Courtesy.--The heart in which the love of Christ abides, will constantly manifest more and more refinement, for the spring of the life is love to God and man. This is Christianity. This is \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" [Luke 2:14.] This is the carrying out of God's purpose. Divine harmony, worthy of the wisdom and mercy which God has manifested to men! True Christian growth tends upward to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. True culture, real refinement of thought and manners, is better obtained through the lessons in the school of Christ, than through the most labored, pains-taking effort to observe forms and set rules, when the heart is not under the holy discipline of the Spirit of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CE", "page": 200}
