{"word": "PAGE 89: THOMAS PAINE.--THE WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE WERE WELL KNOWN AND WIDELY READ IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE 1840'S. HIS BOOK AGE OF REASON WAS A DEISTIC WORK AND DETRIMENTAL TO CHRISTIAN FAITH AND PRACTICE. THE BOOK BEGAN WITH THE WORDS \"I BELIEVE IN ONE GOD AND NO MORE.\" PAINE HAD NO FAITH IN CHRIST, AND HE WAS USED SUCCESSFULLY BY SATAN IN HIS ATTACKS UPON THE CHURCH. AS MRS. WHITE INDICATED, IF SUCH A MAN AS PAINE COULD FIND ENTRANCE TO HEAVEN AND BE HIGHLY HONORED THERE, ANY SINNER, WITHOUT A REFORMATION OF LIFE AND WITHOUT FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST, COULD FIND ADMITTANCE. SHE EXPOSED THIS FALLACY IN VIGOROUS LANGUAGE AND POINTED OUT THE IRRATIONALITY OF SPIRITUALISM.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 301}
