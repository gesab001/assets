{"word": "[In His suffering] the eyes of Jesus wandered over the multitude that had collected together to witness His death, and He saw at the foot of the cross John supporting  Mary, the mother of Christ. She had returned to the terrible scene, not being able to longer remain away from her Son. The  last lesson of Jesus was one of filial love. He looked upon the grief-stricken face of His mother, and then upon John; said He, addressing the former: \"Woman, behold thy son!\" Then, to the disciple: \"Behold thy mother!\" John well understood the words of Jesus, and the sacred trust which was committed to him. He immediately\n57\nremoved the mother of Christ from the fearful scene of Calvary. From that hour he cared for her as would a dutiful son, taking her to his own home. Oh, pitiful, loving Saviour! Amid all His physical pain, and mental anguish, He had a tender, thoughtful care for the mother who had borne Him. He had no money to leave her, by which to insure her future comfort, but He was enshrined in the heart of John, and He gave His mother unto the beloved disciple as a sacred legacy. This trust was to prove a great blessing to John, a constant reminder of His beloved Master.--3SP 160, 161 (1878).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 56}
