{"word": "The baptism of the Holy Spirit will dispel human imaginings, will break down self-erected barriers, and will cause to cease the feeling that \"I am holier than thou.\" There will be a humble spirit with all, more faith and love; self will not be exalted. . . . Christ's spirit, Christ's example, will be exemplified in His people. We shall follow more closely the ways and works of Jesus. . . . The love of Jesus will pervade our hearts.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 114}
