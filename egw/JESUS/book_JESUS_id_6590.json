{"word": "The character of the one who comes to God in faith will bear witness that the Saviour has entered into his life, directing all, pervading all. Such a one is continually asking, \"Is this thy will and way, O my Saviour?\" Constantly he looks to Jesus. . . . He consults the will of his divine Friend in reference to all his actions, for he knows that in this confidence is his strength. He has made it a habit to lift up the heart to God in every perplexity, every uncertainty.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 189}
