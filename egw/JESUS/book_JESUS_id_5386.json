{"word": "Jesus pitied poor sinners so much that he left the courts of heaven, and laid aside the robes of royalty, humiliating himself to humanity, that he might become acquainted with the needs of man, and help him to rise above the degradation of the fall. When he has given to man such unquestionable evidence of his love and tenderest sympathy, how important that his representatives should imitate his example in coming close to their fellow-men, and helping them to form a true Christian character. But some have been too ready to engage in church trials, and have borne sharp and unsympathizing testimony against the erring. In thus acting, they have yielded to a natural propensity that should have been firmly subdued. This is not the calm justice of the Christian executive, but the harsh criticism of a hasty temperament.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 79}
