{"word": "When the Holy Spirit Works Among Us.--The very first and the most important thing is to melt and subdue the soul by presenting our Lord Jesus Christ as the Sin Bearer, the sin-pardoning Saviour, making the gospel as clear as possible. When the Holy Spirit works among us, . . . souls who are unready for Christ's appearing are convicted. . . . The tobacco devotees sacrifice their idol and the liquor drinker his liquor. They could not do this if they did not grasp by faith the promises of God for the forgiveness of their sins.-- Evangelism, page 264.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 105}
