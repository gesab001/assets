{"word": "We are to watch. Christ said, Watch unto prayer. He does not deceive any of us. He takes us to an eminence, shows us the confederacy of evil and the strength of the powers of darkness that are arrayed against all who would have faith in Jesus Christ, and tells us to count the cost; but He does more for us; He does not leave us there without still further encouragement. He does not show us trials and conflicts and leave us without help to fight the battles. But He tells us that God has His angels that minister unto those who shall be heirs of salvation. Round about His throne are thousands and thousands and ten times ten thousands of angels.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 356}
