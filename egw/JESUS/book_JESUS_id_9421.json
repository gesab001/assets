{"word": "The Saviour . . . points out the sign of discipleship: \"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.\" By faith we are to lay hold on a living God, and maintain an experience that shall breathe love, tenderness, kindness, compassion, and affection. These traits of character are the fruit that the Lord Jesus desires us to produce, and to present before the world as a witness that we have a Saviour who can uplift and who can satisfy. . . . We need not be on the losing side, for in everything He is our sufficiency.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 144}
