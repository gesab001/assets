{"word": "sanctification--total commitment\n \n\n     The sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire being--spirit, soul, and body. Paul prayed for the Thessalonians that their \"whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ\" (1 Thessalonians 5:23). Again he writes to believers: \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God\" (Romans 12:1). In the time of ancient Israel every offering brought as a sacrifice to God was carefully examined. If any defect was discovered in the animal presented, it was refused; for God had commanded\n17\nthat the offering be \"without blemish.\" So Christians are bidden to present their bodies, \"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\" In order to do this, all their powers must be preserved in the best possible condition. Every practice that weakens physical or mental strength unfits man for the service of his Creator.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "NL", "page": 17}
