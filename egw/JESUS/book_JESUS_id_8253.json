{"word": "Jesus, your precious Saviour, now calls you to take your position firmly upon the platform of eternal truth. \n\n318 \n\nIf you suffer with Him, He will crown you with glory in His everlasting kingdom. If you are willing to sacrifice all for Him, then He will be your Saviour. But if you choose your own way, you will follow on in darkness until it is too late to secure the eternal reward.--3T 45, 46 (1872).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 317}
