{"word": "Some Who Not Will Be There \n111\nTHE WICKED OF ALL GENERATIONS.\\97In fearful majesty He [Jesus] calls forth the wicked dead. They are wakened from their long sleep. What a dreadful waking! They behold the Son of God in His stern majesty and resplendent glory. All, as soon as they behold Him, know that He is the crucified one who died to save them, whom they had despised and rejected. They are in number like the sand upon the sea shore. At the first resurrection all come forth in immortal bloom, but at the second, the marks of the curse are visible upon all. All come up as they went down into their graves.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 111}
