For \"if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new\" (2 Corinthians 5:17). That which was objectionable in the character is purified from the soul by the love of Jesus. All selfishness is expelled, all envy, all evil-speaking, is rooted out, and a radical transformation is wrought in the heart. \"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law\" (Galatians 5:22, 23). \"The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace\" (James 3:18).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 289}
