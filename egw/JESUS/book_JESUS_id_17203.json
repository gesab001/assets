{"word": "All who hold fast to themselves, as if fearful that after all the Lord Jesus does not mean as He says, show great dishonor to God. In keeping away from Jesus do not our actions say, \"I do not believe the Lord Jesus means it\"? You do not treat your human friends in this doubting, distrustful manner.

This is very trying to me, nevertheless I cannot believe your word.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 158}
