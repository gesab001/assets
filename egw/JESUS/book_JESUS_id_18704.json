{"word": "Jesus is ministering in the heavenly sanctuary, but He is with His workers also; for He declares, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" (Matthew 28:20). He is spiritual director of His church on earth, and He longs to see the members filled with a determination to labor harmoniously for the advancement of His kingdom. He has raised up a succession of workers who derive their authority from Him, the Great Teacher. He has chosen for His work men of varied talents and varied capabilities. Some of these might not be the men you would choose, but you will pass through an experience that will lead you to see that God exalts men whom you would regard as inferior to yourselves.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 210}
