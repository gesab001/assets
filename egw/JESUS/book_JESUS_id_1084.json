{"word": "Those who are teaching the most solemn message ever given to the world, should discipline the mind to comprehend its significance. The theme of \n                                                                           120\nredemption will bear the most concentrated study, and its depth will never be fully explored. You need not fear that you will exhaust this wonderful theme. Drink deep of the well of salvation. Go to the fountain for yourself, that you may be filled with refreshment, that Jesus may be in you a well of water, springing up unto everlasting life. Only Bible truth and Bible religion will stand the test of the judgment. We are not to pervert the word of God to suit our convenience, and worldly interests, but to honestly inquire, \"What wilt thou have me to do?\" \"Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price.\" [1 Corinthians 6:19, 20.] And what a price! Not \"with corruptible things, as silver and gold, . . . but with the precious blood of Christ.\" [1 Peter 1:18, 19.] When man was lost, the Son of God said, I will redeem him, I will become his surety and substitute. He laid aside his royal robes, clothed his divinity with humanity, stepped down from the royal throne, that he might reach the very depth of human woe and temptation, lift up our fallen natures, and make it possible for us to be overcomers,--the sons of God, the heirs of the eternal kingdom. Shall we then allow any consideration of earth to turn us away from the path of truth? Shall we not challenge every doctrine and theory, and put it to the test of God's word?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CE", "page": 119}
