{"word": "Some who claim to love Jesus are deceivers and all their religion is lip service. It does not transform the character. It does not reveal the inward working of grace. They do not show that they have ever learned in Christ's school the lessons of meekness and lowliness of heart. They do not show by life or character that they are wearing Christ's yoke or lifting Christ's burdens. They are not reaching the standard given them in God's Word, but a human standard. Their life is not pure like Christ's life. They are not being refined and ennobled by His Spirit. The way of truth they have not known, and they are of that number who will say, \"Lord, Lord, open unto us. We have taught in the streets. We have done many wonderful works.\" But Christ will say of them, \"I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity\" (Matthew 7:23).--Ibid.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 299}
