{"word": "Chap. 18 - Hope for the Tempted\n     In order to reach excellency of character, we must realize the value which Christ has placed upon the human race. In the beginning, man was invested with dignity; but he fell through indulgence of appetite. Notwithstanding the great gulf thus opened between God and man, Christ loved the hopeless sinner, and came to our world to bridge the gulf, and unite divine power to human weakness, that in his strength and grace man might wrestle for himself against Satan's temptations, overcome for himself, and stand in his God-given manhood, a victor over perverted appetite and degrading passions. The last words of David to Solomon, then a young man and soon to be honored with the throne of Israel, were, \\93Be thou strong, . . . and show thyself a man.\\94 [1 Kings 2:2.] To the weak and tempted one I address the same, \\93Show thyself a man.\\94 I point you to the cross of Calvary. I bid you in the name of Jesus, Look and live. Destroy not yourself. With God's blessing it is possible for you to gain the ascendency over appetite and debasing passion.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CTBH", "page": 146}
