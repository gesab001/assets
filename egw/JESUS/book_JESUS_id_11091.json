{"word": "You may be disappointed, and your will and your way may be denied; but be assured that the Lord loves you. The furnace fire may kindle upon you, not for the purpose of destroying you, but to consume the dross, that you may come forth as gold seven times purified. Bear in mind that \n                                                                           273\nGod will give you songs in the night. Darkness may seem to enclose you, but you are not to look at the clouds. Beyond the darkest cloud there is an ever-shining light. The Lord has light for every soul. Open the door of the heart to hope, peace, and joy. Jesus says, \"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full\" (John 15:11).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 272}
