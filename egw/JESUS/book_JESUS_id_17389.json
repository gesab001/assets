{"word": "The Saviour's words have a message of comfort to those also who are suffering affliction or bereavement. Our sorrows do not spring out of the ground. God \"doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.\" Lamentations 3:33. When He permits trials and afflictions, it is \"for our profit, that we might be partakers of His holiness.\" Hebrews 12:10. If received in faith, the trial that seems so bitter and hard to bear will prove a blessing. The cruel blow that blights the joys of earth will be the means of turning our eyes to heaven. How many there are who would never have known Jesus had not sorrow led them to seek comfort in Him!", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MB", "page": 10}
