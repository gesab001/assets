{"word": "Do not choose subjects that please people and offend none.--Some ministers choose for their sermons subjects that will please the people and offend none. This is shunning the cross of Christ. You see one man selfish; another controlled by pride or passion; another robbing God in tithes and offerings; and another doubting and unbelieving. Do not leave these deceived ones to remain blinded by the enemy in regard to their own spiritual standing. For each of these there is a special message in the Word of God. Pray for wisdom that you may be able so to present the instructions of that sacred Word that all may see wherein their characters are defective, and what is required of them in order to conform to the true standard. Win their confidence and affection. Bring the truth as it is in Jesus to bear upon their hearts; for there is no other power that can keep the soul steadfast.--RH June 17, 1884.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 195}
