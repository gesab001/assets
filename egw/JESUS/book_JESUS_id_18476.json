{"word": "Needs Supplied as We impart.--Christ has bidden us, through the prophet, \"Deal thy bread to the hungry,\" and \"satisfy the afflicted soul;\" \"when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him,\" and \"bring the poor that are cast out to thy house.\" He has bidden us, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" But how often our hearts sink and faith fails us as we see how great is the need and how small the means in our hands. Like Andrew looking upon the five barley loaves and the two little fishes, we \n                                                                           264\nexclaim, \"What are they among so many?\" Often we hesitate, unwilling to give all that we have, fearing to spend and to be spent for others. But Jesus has bidden us, \"Give ye them to eat.\" His command is a promise, and behind it is the same power that fed the multitude beside the sea.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 263}
