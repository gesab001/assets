{"word": "But Mary chose to linger around the sepulcher, thinking of what she had seen and distressed with the thought that she might have been deceived. She felt that new trials awaited her. Her grief was renewed, and she broke forth in bitter weeping. She stooped down to look again into the sepulcher, and beheld two angels clothed in white. One was sitting where the head of Jesus had lain, the other where His feet had been. They spoke to her tenderly and asked her why she wept. She replied, \"They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\" John 20:13.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 235}
