{"word": "Again: Satan may try to tempt you by saying that God will not have pity upon you and hear your prayers, because you are such a sinner. Do not listen to his story; but throw right into his face the words of our Saviour, \\93I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\\94 If we were not sinners, we would have no need of a Saviour. We are sick with sin from the crown of our head to the sole of our feet, and this is why we need a Physician. While we are not to approach the throne of God in self-righteousness and self-sufficiency, thinking that we have any goodness to recommend us to him; while we are not to forget our weakness and sinfulness, it is at the same time our duty to believe that Jesus will impart to us of his healing, strengthening power. Our faith must grasp the eternal. We must move from principle, looking not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are unseen.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 132}
