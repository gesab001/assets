{"word": "The sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire being,--spirit, soul, and body. Paul prayed for the Thessalonians, that their \"whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Again he writes to believers, \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\" [Romans 12:1.] The Jews were commanded to offer in sacrifice to God only such animals as were free from disease or blemish. So Christians are required to preserve all their powers in the best possible condition for the Lord's service. Says Peter, \"Abstain from fleshly lusts, \n                                                                           303\nwhich war against the soul.\" [1 Peter 2:11.] The word of God will make but a feeble impression upon those whose faculties are benumbed by any sinful gratification. The heart cannot preserve consecration to God while the animal appetites and passions are indulged at the expense of health and life. Paul writes to the Corinthians, \"Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\" [2 Corinthians 7:1.] And with the fruits of the Spirit--\"love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,\"--he classes temperance.
