{"word": "To every man God has given his work, \"according to his several ability.\" God has the measure of our ability, and knows just what to lay upon us. Of the one who is found faithful, the command is given, Intrust him with greater responsibility. If he proves faithful to that trust, the word is given again, Trust him with still more. Thus through the grace of Christ he grows to the full measure of a man in Christ Jesus.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 301}
