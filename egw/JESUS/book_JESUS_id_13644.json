{"word": "\"The dead were judged,\" says John, \"out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.\" [Revelation 20:12.] Angels of God have kept a faithful record of the lives of all, and they are to be judged according to their deeds. In view of this Judgment, Peter exhorted the men of Israel: \"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus,\" \"whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.\" [Acts 3:19-21.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 308}
