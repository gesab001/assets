Jesus said to the lawyer, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first commandment.\" Matthew 22:37, 38.

We cannot advance in Christian experience until we put away everything that separates us from God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 377}
