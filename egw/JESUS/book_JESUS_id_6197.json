{"word": "HIS WELL-BELOVED BROTHERS.\\97The black man\\92s name is written in the book of life beside the white man\\92s. All are one in Christ. Birth, station, nationality, or color cannot elevate or degrade men. The character makes the man. If a red man, a Chinaman, or an African gives his heart to God in obedience and faith, Jesus loves him none the less for his color. He calls him His well-beloved brother.\\97The Southern Work, p. 8 quoted in ChS 218.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 92}
