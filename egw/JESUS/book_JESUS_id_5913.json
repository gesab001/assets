{"word": "Before his presence, \\93all faces are turned into paleness;\\94 upon the rejecters of God's mercy falls the terror of eternal despair. \\93The heart melteth, and the knees smite together,\\94 \\93and the faces of them all gather blackness.\\94 [Jeremiah 30:6; Nahum 2:10.] The righteous cry with trembling, \\93Who shall be able to stand?\\94 The angels\\92 song is hushed, and there is a period of awful silence. Then the voice of Jesus is heard, saying, \\93My grace is sufficient for you.\\94 The faces of the righteous are lighted up, and joy fills every heart. And the angels strike a note higher, and sing again, as they draw still nearer to the earth.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 641}
