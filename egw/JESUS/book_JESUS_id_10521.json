{"word": "Did ever anyone lift [his] hands to Jesus and say, \"Save, Lord, or I perish,\" and He pass [him] by? Never, never! He is a Jesus that hears the faintest cry. We need none of us faint or cry or be discouraged. We need not faint, for like Peter, we may look to the darkness and trials around us. . . . The Lord took the hand of Peter and he was saved. And thus we have a Saviour and in every trial we are to trust in the Lord God of Israel and He will be our Helper.--Manuscript 10, 1891.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 356}
