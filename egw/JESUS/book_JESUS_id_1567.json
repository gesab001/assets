Tears of joy filled her eyes as she felt that her act was understood and appreciated. . . . Jesus understood her motive. She believed the service of the temple to be of God's appointment, and she was anxious to do her utmost to sustain it. She did what she could, and her act was to be a monument to her memory through all time, and her joy in eternity. Her heart went with her gift; its value was estimated, not by the worth of the coin, but by the love to God and the interest in His work that had prompted the deed. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CC", "page": 303}
