His feet had the appearance of fire; in His right hand was a sharp sickle; in His left, a silver trumpet. His eyes were as a flame of fire, which searched His children through and through. Then all faces gathered paleness, and those that God had rejected gathered blackness. Then we all cried out, \"Who shall be able to stand? Is my robe spotless?\" Then the angels ceased to sing, and there was some time of awful silence, when Jesus spoke: \"Those who have clean hands and pure hearts shall be able to stand; My grace is sufficient for you.\" At this our faces lighted up, and joy filled every heart. And the angels struck a note higher and sang again, while the cloud drew still nearer the earth.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Mar", "page": 289}
