They would have delivered Jesus out of their hands; but the commanding angels forbade them, and said that it was a great ransom that was to be paid for man; but it would be complete, and would cause the death of him \n                                                                           51\nwho had the power of death. Jesus knew that angels were witnessing the scene of his humiliation. I saw that the feeblest angel could have caused that multitude to fall powerless, and delivered Jesus. He knew that if he should desire it of his Father, angels would instantly release him. But it was necessary that Jesus should suffer many things of wicked men, in order to carry out the plan of salvation.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SG", "page": 50}
