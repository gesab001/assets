{"word": "This world is the place in which to prepare to appear in God's presence. Individuals will here show what power affects their hearts, and controls their actions. . . .

If individuals, when tested, refuse to sacrifice their idols, . . . the Spirit of God will leave them with their sinful traits unsubdued, to the control of evil angels.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 162}
