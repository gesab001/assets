{"word": "Precious light will be given in the publications you scatter through the towns and cities. Your humble prayers, your unselfish activity, will be blessed of God, and the truth as it is in Jesus will come to those who need it. The words that Christ spoke to men while He was in the world He will speak again through His humble, faithful followers. Through them He will give to men the bread of life and the waters of salvation. Brethren, take up this work in humility of heart. The simplicity of true godliness will cause you to be respected and will lead men and women to seek the source of your power. Believe, and you will receive the things you ask for.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 436}
