{"word": "The Christian pilgrim does not yield to his desire to rest. He moves steadily forward, saying: \"The night is far spent, the day is at hand.\" This is his motto: \"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after. . . . I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\" Philippians 3:12-14. \n\n\n                                                               (19)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "8T", "page": 18}
