For this is the will of God, even your sanctification.\" 1 Thessalonians 4:1-3. \"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him: rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.\" Colossians 2:6-8.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 584}
