THEY SAW THAT THERE WERE TWO VAILS OR DOORS IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD; HEBREWS 9:3; AND THAT AT THAT TIME ONE WAS SHUT AND THE OTHER WAS OPENED. WITH EARNEST ZEAL AND NEW HOPE THEY PREACHED THESE TRUTHS, AND URGED THEIR FELLOWMEN TO SEEK AN ENTRANCE BY FAITH INTO THE MOST HOLY PLACE WITHIN THE SECOND VAIL, WHERE OUR GREAT HIGH PRIEST IS GONE TO BLOT OUT THE SINS OF ALL HIS FAITHFUL ONES, FROM ABEL TO THE PRESENT TIME. THEIR FAITH WAS IN AN OPEN DOOR WHICH NO MAN CAN SHUT UNTIL THE WORK THEREIN IS FULLY DONE. IN THE WORK OF INVITING SINNERS TO COME TO THIS OPEN DOOR, THEY CONTINUE UNTIL THE PRESENT TIME; AND THIS WILL BE THEIR WORK UNTIL JESUS HIMSELF SHALL PROCLAIM, \"HE THAT IS UNJUST, LET HIM BE UNJUST STILL;\" REVELATION 22:11; THAT IS, UNTIL PROBATION IS CLOSED AND THE MINISTRY OF THE GOSPEL IS ENDED.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 499}
