{"word": "To Jesus, who emptied Himself for the salvation of lost humanity, the Holy Spirit was given without measure. So it will be given to every follower of Christ when the whole heart is surrendered for His indwelling. Our Lord Himself has given the command, \"Be filled with the Spirit,\" and this command is also a promise of its fulfillment. It was the good pleasure of the Father that in Christ should \"all the fulness\" dwell; and \"in him ye are made full\" (Colossians 2:9, 10, R.V.).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 151}
