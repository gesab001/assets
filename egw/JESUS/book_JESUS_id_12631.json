Viewing the beautiful scene, he employed it as a symbol, \"Say not ye there are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.\" He here referred to the gospel field, to the work of Christianity among the poor, despised Samaritans. His hand reached out to gather them into the garner; they were ready for the harvest.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 146}
