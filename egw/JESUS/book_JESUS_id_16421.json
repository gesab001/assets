{"word": "Some gleams of the truth were penetrating the ruler's  mind. Christ's words filled him with awe, and led to the inquiry, \"How can these things be?\" With deep earnestness Jesus answered, \"Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?\" His words convey \n                                                                           369\nto Nicodemus the lesson that, instead of feeling irritated over the plain words of truth, and indulging irony, he should have a far more humble opinion of himself, because of his spiritual ignorance. Yet the words of Christ were spoken with such solemn dignity, and both look and tone expressed such earnest love to him, that he was not offended as he realized his humiliating position.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 368}
