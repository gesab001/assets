{"word": "The end is near, and every soul is now to walk carefully, humbly, meekly with Christ Jesus. Our precious Saviour, from whom all the rays of truth radiate to the world, wants us to put not our trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help; but to lean wholly upon Him. He says: \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" John 15:5. We need to look to Jesus constantly in order that He may impress upon us His own lovely image. We are to behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. Then we shall reveal Christ to our fellow men. \n\n\n     (204)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "9T", "page": 203}
