{"word": "Enshrined in the pillar of cloud, the Lord Jesus had given special direction in regard to the performance of acts of mercy toward man and beast. While the law \n                                                                           48\nof God requires supreme love to God and impartial love to our neighbors, its far-reaching requirements also take in the dumb creatures that cannot express in words their wants or sufferings. \"Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.\" He who loves God not only will love his fellow men but will regard with tender compassion the creatures which God has made. When the Spirit of God is in man, it leads him to relieve rather than to create suffering.--Review and Herald, Jan. 1, 1895.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 47}
