That sign was given as the heavenly dove rested upon Jesus and the glory of God shone round about Him. John reached forth his hand, pointing to Jesus, and with a loud voice cried out, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!\" John 1:29.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 196}
