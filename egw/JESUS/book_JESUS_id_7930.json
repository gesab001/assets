{"word": "Warn every student that he must be wide-awake. Let this truth be firmly fixed upon the mind by our ministers and by all who in faith are acting a part to rid the human mind of error, that there can be no higher education than that which came forth from Him who gave His life that humanity might grasp divinity, and fallen man become one with God. The teacher who is so foolish as to think that he can give to the students a more perfect knowledge than that given by the Great Teacher, Christ Jesus, is ignorant of what constitutes the higher education.--Letter 98, 1909.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 88}
