My prayers shall be, that God may bless you at your camp meetings, and that your souls may be refreshed by His grace. If God bids me leave my writing to attend these meetings or to speak to the people in different places, I hope to  hear and obey His voice.\" [SIGNS OF THE TIMES, APRIL 5, 1883.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 268}
