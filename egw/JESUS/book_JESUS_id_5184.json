{"word": "The heart that has once tasted the love of Christ, cries out continually for a deeper draft, and as you impart you will receive in richer and more abundant measure. Every revelation of God to the soul increases the capacity to know and to love. The continual cry of the heart is, \"More of Thee,\" and ever the Spirit's answer is, \"Much more.\" . . . To Jesus, who emptied Himself for the salvation of lost humanity, the Holy Spirit was given without measure. So it will be given to every follower of Christ when the whole heart is surrendered for His indwelling. Our Lord Himself has given the command, \"Be filled with the Spirit\" (Ephesians 5:18), and this command is also a promise of its fulfillment. It was the good pleasure of the Father that in Christ should \"all the fullness dwell,\" and \"in him ye are made full\" (Colossians 1:19, R.V.; 2:10, R.V.).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 213}
