{"word": "We will always have tried and tempted ones to deal with, and it is essential that we be converted to God every day and be vessels that can be used unto His name's honor and glory. The true value of the soul can be estimated only by the cross of Calvary. \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Those who are unconverted, who are unsanctified, will make manifest what manner of spirit they are of. They will show by their likes and dislikes that their natural feelings are not under the control of a sanctified will. The religion of Jesus Christ is one which will revolutionize the entire man. The truth of God has power to transform the character.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 185}
