{"word": "When the great sacrifice had been consummated, Christ ascended on high, refusing the adoration of angels until he had preferred the request, \"I will that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.\" [John 17:24.] Then with inexpressible love and power came forth the answer from the Father's throne, \"Let all the angels of God worship him.\" [Hebrews 1:6.] Not a stain rested upon Jesus. His humiliation ended, his sacrifice completed, there was given unto him a name that is above every name.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 322}
