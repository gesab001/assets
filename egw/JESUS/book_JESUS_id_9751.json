{"word": "None who listened to Jesus could feel neglected or forgotten.--Jesus sought an avenue to every heart. By using a variety of illustrations, He not only presented truth in its different phases, but appealed to the different hearers. Their interest was aroused by figures drawn from the surroundings of their daily life. None who listened to the Saviour could feel that they were neglected or forgotten. The humblest, the most sinful, heard in His teaching a voice that spoke to them in sympathy and tenderness.--COL 21.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 286}
