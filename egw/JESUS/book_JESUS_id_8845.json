{"word": "Christ made satisfaction for the guilt of the whole world, and all who will come to God in faith, will receive the righteousness of Christ, \"who His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed\" (1 Peter 2:24). Our sin has been expiated, put away, cast into the depths of the sea. Through repentance and faith we are rid of sin, and look unto the Lord our righteousness. Jesus suffered, the just for the unjust.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "NL", "page": 23}
