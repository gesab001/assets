{"word": "JESUS URGED THE NECESSITY OF PRAYER.\\97He [Jesus] urged upon men the necessity of prayer, repentance, confession, and the abandonment of sin. He taught them honesty, forbearance, mercy, and compassion, enjoining upon them to love not only those who loved them, but those who hated them, who treated them despitefully. In this He was revealing to them the character of the Father, who is long-suffering, merciful, and gracious, slow to anger, and full of goodness and truth.\\97(Christian Education, 74.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 19}
