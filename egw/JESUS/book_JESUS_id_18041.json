{"word": "Eternal redemption never looked so exceedingly precious as at the present time, and I never felt more deeply in earnest to overcome on every point as now. There must be no defects in our character, not one. Every spot and wrinkle must be effaced by the blood of the Lamb.

The fruits we bear in patience, kindness, forbearance, and self-denial will testify of us that we have learned of Jesus.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 154}
