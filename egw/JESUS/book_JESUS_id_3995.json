{"word": "The power of God there convicted the jailer. He called for a light, and springing in, came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out, and said, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\" And they said, \"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\" The keeper of the prison then assembled his whole household, and Paul preached unto them Jesus. Thus the jailer's heart was united to those of his brethren, and he washed their stripes, and he and all his house were baptized that night. He then set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 205}
