{"word": "The Bible is unchained. It can be carried to every man's door, and its truths may be presented to every man's conscience. There are many who, like the noble Bereans, will search the Scriptures daily for themselves, when the truth is presented, to see whether or not these things are so. Christ has said, \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.\" Jesus, the world's Redeemer, bids men not only to read, but to \"search the Scriptures.\" This is a great and important work, and it is committed to us, and in doing this we shall be greatly benefited; for obedience to Christ's command will not go unrewarded. He will crown with especial tokens of His favor this act of loyalty in following the light revealed in His word.--TSS 29, 30.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 84}
