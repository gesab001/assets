{"word": "Another cause of dissension had arisen. At a feast it was customary for a servant to wash the feet of the guests. . . . The pitcher, the basin, and the towel were there, in readiness for the feet washing; but no servant was present, and it was the disciples' part to perform it. . . . Jesus waited for a time to see what they would do. Then He, the divine Teacher, rose from the table. Laying aside the outer garment that would have impeded His movements, He took a towel, and girded Himself. . . . \"After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet.\" . . . So Christ expressed His love for His disciples.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 157}
