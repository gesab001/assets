{"word": "In the parable of the shepherd Jesus puts His own interpretation on His work and mission, and represents Himself as the good shepherd, feeding and taking charge of the sheep. He said, \"He that entereth not by the door [by himself] into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.\" Christ said that all who came before Him claiming to be the Messiah were deceivers. All the time of Christ's coming there was much agitation concerning the appearance of the world's Messiah. The Jewish nation expected that a great deliverer would come, and there were men who took advantage of this expectation, turning it to the service of themselves, that they might be thereby profited and glorified. Prophecy had foretold that these deceivers would arise. The deceivers did not come in the way in which it was prophesied that the world's Redeemer should come; but Christ came, answering every specification. Types and symbols had represented Him, and in Him type met antitype. In the life, mission, and death of Jesus every specification was fulfilled.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 197}
