{"word": "31 (ch. 6:15; 1 Samuel 15:22; Revelation 22:14; see EGW on 2 Corinthians 3:7-18; Ephesians 2:14-16; Revelation 2:6). God's Standard Has Not Changed.--The gospel of good news was not to be interpreted as allowing men to live in continued rebellion against God by transgressing His just and holy law. Why cannot those who claim to understand the Scriptures, see that God's requirement under grace is just the same He made in Eden--perfect obedience to His law. In the judgment, God will ask those who profess to be Christians, Why did you claim to believe in My Son, and continue to transgress My law? Who required this at your hands--to trample upon My rules of righteousness? \"Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\" The gospel of the New Testament is not the Old Testament standard lowered to meet the sinner and save him in his sins. God requires of all His subjects obedience, entire obedience to all His commandments. He demands now as ever perfect righteousness as the only title to heaven. Christ is our hope and our refuge. His righteousness is imputed only to the obedient. Let us accept it through faith, that the Father shall find in us no sin. But those who have trampled on the holy law will have no right to claim that righteousness. O that we might view the immensity of the plan of salvation as obedient children to all God's requirements, believing that we have peace \n                                                                           1073\nwith God through Jesus Christ, our atoning sacrifice (RH Sept. 21, 1886)!", "paragraph": 8, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1072}
