They should daily pray for the light of the Holy Spirit to shine upon the pages of the sacred book, that they may be enabled to comprehend the things of the Spirit of God. We must have implicit trust in God's word, or we are lost. The words of men, however great they may be, are not able to make us perfect, to thoroughly furnish unto all good works. \"God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.\" In this text the two agencies in the salvation of man are revealed,--the divine influence, the strong, living faith of those who follow Christ.
