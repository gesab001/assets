{"word": "True holiness and humility are inseparable. The nearer the soul comes to God, the more completely is it humbled and subdued. When Job heard the voice of the Lord out of the whirlwind, he exclaimed, \"I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes\" (Job 42:6). It was when Isaiah saw the glory of the Lord and heard the cherubim crying, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,\" that he cried out, \"Woe is me! for I am undone\" (Isaiah 6:3, 5). Daniel, when visited by the holy messenger, says, \"My comeliness was turned in me into corruption\" (Daniel 10:8). Paul, after he was caught up into the third heaven and heard things that it was not lawful for a man to utter, speaks of himself as \"less than the least of all saints\" (Ephesians 3:8). It was the beloved John, who leaned on Jesus' breast and beheld His glory, who fell as one dead before the angel. The more closely and continuously we behold our Saviour, the less shall we see to approve in ourselves.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 175}
