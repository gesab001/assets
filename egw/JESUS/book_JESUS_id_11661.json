{"word": "18 (chs. 4:15; 5:7, 8; John 14:30; see EGW on Matthew 4:1-11; 1 John 2:1). The Refined Sensibilities of Jesus.--Would that we could comprehend the significance of the words, Christ \"suffered being tempted.\" While He was free from the taint of sin, the refined sensibilities of His holy nature rendered contact with evil unspeakably painful to Him. Yet with human nature upon Him, He met the archapostate face to face, and single-handed withstood the foe of His throne. Not even by a thought could Christ be brought to yield to the power of temptation.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 927}
