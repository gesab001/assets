{"word": "It is your duty to change your course of action.  Learn to see and to recognize ability and talent in others besides yourself.  For Christ's sake, do not lord it over His heritage but be an ensample to the flock.  Give to others the benefit of all the knowledge that the Lord has given \n49\nto you.  He has given you this knowledge that you may impart it.  Teach to others everything that you know, not in an arbitrary manner, making light of their mistakes and ridiculing their ignorance; but in a kindly spirit, you yourself sitting at the feet of Jesus as a learner.  Take young men into your mission home, and be their instructor, teaching them as you would teach students in a school.--Letter 10, 1884 (October 27, 1884, to J. O. Corliss).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "ChL", "page": 48}
