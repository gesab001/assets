{"word": "\"Learn of me,\" said the Divine Teacher, \"for I am meek and lowly in heart. . . .\" We must learn self-denial, we must learn courage, patience, fortitude, and forgiving love. . . . If we have faith in Jesus as our helper, if our eyes of faith are directed to Him constantly, we shall become like Jesus in character. He will abide in our hearts and we will abide in Christ. Being clothed with the righteousness of Christ, our lives are hid with Christ in God. He will be our counselor. If we ask Him in faith, He will enlighten our understanding. . . . The lessons which Christ has given us will be practiced.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 99}
