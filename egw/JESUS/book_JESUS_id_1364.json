{"word": "The black man's name is written in the book of life beside the white man's. All are one in Christ. Birth, station, nationality, or color cannot elevate or degrade men. The character makes the man. If a red man, a Chinaman, or an African gives his heart to God in obedience and faith, Jesus loves him none the less for his color. He calls him His well-beloved brother.--The Southern Work, p. 8, written March 20, 1891.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 218}
