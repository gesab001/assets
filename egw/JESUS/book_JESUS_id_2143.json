{"word": "Only a Little While Now \n\n     It will only be a little while before Jesus will come to save His children and to give them the finishing touch of immortality. \"This corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality.\" The graves will be opened, and the dead will come forth victorious, crying, \"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\" Our loved ones who sleep in Jesus will come forth clothed with immortality.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CS", "page": 350}
