{"word": "That which especially excites the enmity of the world in our day is the presentation of the claims of the fourth commandment. And this is the special work for the people of God at this time. The prophet John, looking down to the last days, saw that the temple of God was open in heaven, and the ark of his testament was seen. That ark contains God's holy law, and John sees a people whose eyes are directed to the temple; their attention is fixed upon the law contained in the ark. \\93Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\\94 Heaven is watching this work with the deepest interest. Angels are watching the development of character, and are weighing moral worth. They are bidden to place a mark upon those who are loyal to God's commandments; such will have special help from God to endure the test and proving of the time of trouble.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 196}
