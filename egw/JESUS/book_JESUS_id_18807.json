{"word": "During the time of trouble, the position of God's people will be similar to the position of Joshua. They will not be ignorant of the work going on in heaven in their behalf. They will realize that sin is recorded against their names, but they will also know that the sins of all who repent and lay hold of the merits of Christ will be canceled. . . . Those who have manifested true repentance for sin, and by living faith in Christ are obedient to God's commandments, will have their names retained in the book of life, and they will be confessed before the Father and before the holy angels. Jesus will say, \"They are mine; I have purchased them with my own blood.\"--Signs of the Times, June 2, 1890.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 359}
