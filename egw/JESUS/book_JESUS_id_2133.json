{"word": "Chap. 65 - The Place of Reward as a Motive in Service\n\n     Repeatedly the Saviour says, \"Many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.\" Jesus would have those who are engaged in His service, not eager for rewards, nor feel that they must receive compensation for all that they do. The Lord would have our minds run in a different channel; for He sees not as man sees. He does not judge by appearances, but estimates a man by the sincerity of his heart.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CS", "page": 339}
