{"word": "Please eat, Marian, because your earthly physician would have you eat, and the great Medical Missionary would have you eat; and Sister [M. J.] Nelson will get anything you ask for. No one can be more pleased than I to have your life spared to continue to do the work; but if your or my time is come to fall asleep in Jesus, we must not shorten life by refusing the nourishment that the system must have. Now eat, my dear, whether you want to eat or not, and thus act your part toward recovery. Do your very best to recover, and then if it please the Lord to give you rest, you have done what you could. I appreciate your labors. Praise the Lord, Marian, that Jesus, the Great Physician, can heal you. In love.--Letter 379, 1904.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 253}
