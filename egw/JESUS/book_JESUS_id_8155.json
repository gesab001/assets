{"word": "Look upon the glorious things of God in nature, and let your heart go out in gratitude to the Giver. There is in nature's book profitable study for the mind. Be not thankless and reckless. Open the eyes of your understanding; see the beautiful harmony in the laws of God in nature, and be awed, and reverence your Creator, the supreme Ruler of heaven and earth. See him, by the eye of faith, bending over you in love, saying with compassion, \"My son, my daughter, give Me thy heart.\" Make the surrender to Jesus, and then with grateful hearts you can say, \"I know that my Redeemer liveth.\" Your faith in Jesus will give strength to every purpose, consistency to the character.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 410}
