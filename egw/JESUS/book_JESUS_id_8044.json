{"word": "Our Constant Dependence \n\n     Those who fail to realize their constant dependence upon God will be overcome by temptation. We may now suppose that our feet stand secure, and that we shall never be moved. We may say with confidence, \"I know in whom I have believed; nothing can shake my faith in God and in His word.\" But Satan is planning to take advantage of our hereditary and cultivated traits of character, and to blind our eyes to our own necessities and defects. Only through realizing our own weakness, and looking steadfastly unto Jesus, can we walk securely.--\"Desire of Ages,\" p. 382.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 101}
