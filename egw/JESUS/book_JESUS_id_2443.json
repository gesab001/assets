{"word": "There is need of a missionary, self-sacrificing, self-denying spirit with all who connect with the work God has given me to do, else my influence will not be what God designs it shall be. And unless you are advancing in the knowledge and love of God, you cannot maintain even the light that you now have. If the light does not shine more and more, it will grow dim and flicker away in darkness. Every\n137\nwork will be mingled and tainted with self. God will not accept it. It is impossible for myself, or any connected with me, to be channels of light and bear the duties and responsibilities that this work involves unless they are growing in grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ. All connected with me and the solemn work God has given me to do must represent the character of that work. [They must] be an example to others in humility and Christlike character, in faithfulness, in cross-bearing, in prompt and vigorous action, in unswerving fidelity to the sanctifying influence of truth, and in sacrifices and labors to bless others. In order to do this there must be an ever-growing Christian experience. Faith must be strong, consecration complete; sympathy, tenderness, and love must pervade the soul. They must be patient in tribulation and Christlike in conversation, and even the thoughts [must be] brought into captivity to Jesus Christ.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 136}
