{"word": "An Appeal \n\n     There are some who love the society of the world, who regard the companionship of the worldling as something to be desired above the companionship of those who love God and keep His commandments. Teachers, know enough to obey God. Know enough to follow the footsteps of Jesus, to wear the yoke of Christ. Do you desire the wisdom of God? Then humble yourselves before Him; walk in the way of His commandments; determine that you will make the most of every opportunity granted you. Gather every ray of light that falls across your pathway. Follow the light. Bring the teachings of truth into your life practice. As you humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, He will lift you up. Commit your work to Him; labor in faithfulness, in sincerity, in truth, and you will find that each day's labor brings its reward.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 235}
