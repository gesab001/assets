Before His death, Jesus had said to him, \"Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.\" To this Peter had replied, \"Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake\" (John 13:36, 37). . . . Peter had failed when the test came, but again he was to have opportunity to prove his love for Christ. . . .
