{"word": "I saw how this grace could be obtained. Go to your closet, and there alone plead with God: \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\" Be in earnest, be sincere. Fervent prayer availeth much. Jacoblike, wrestle in prayer. Agonize. Jesus, in the garden, sweat great drops of blood; you must make an effort. Do not leave your closet until you feel strong in God; then watch, and just as long as you watch and pray you can keep these evil besetments under, and the grace of God can and will appear in you.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1T", "page": 158}
