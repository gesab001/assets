{"word": "\\93Jesus of Nazareth, the true Messiah,\\94 he said, \\93whose hands and feet were pierced, who was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, who was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, who after the scepter was taken from Judah, and the legislative power from between his feet, came the first time, shall come the second time in the clouds of heaven, and with the trump of the archangel,\\94 and \\93shall stand upon the Mount of Olives. And that dominion once consigned to Adam over the creation and forfeited by him (Genesis 1:26; 3:17) shall be given to Jesus. He shall be king over all the earth. The groanings and lamentations of the creation shall cease, but songs of praise and thanksgiving shall be heard.\\94 \\93When Jesus comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels,\\94 \\93the dead believers shall rise first. 1 Thessalonians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 15:23. This is what we Christians call the first resurrection. Then the animal kingdom shall change its nature (Isaiah 11:6-9), and shall be subdued unto Jesus. Psalm 8. Universal peace shall prevail.\\94 \\93The Lord again shall look down upon the earth, and say, \\91Behold, it is very good.\\92\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 359}
