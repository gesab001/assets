{"word": "Those who come into sacred relation with the God of heaven are not left to the natural weakness and infirmity of their natures. . . . The world loses all attraction for them, for they seek a better country, an eternal world, a life that is to continue through never-ending ages. This is the theme of their thought and conversation. The Word of God becomes exceedingly precious. They discern spiritual things. They rejoice in \"that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ\" (Titus 2:13). They long to see the King in His beauty, the angels that have never fallen, and the land of unfading bloom.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 95}
