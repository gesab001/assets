They put a reed into His hand, and bowed to Him, and mockingly saluted Him, \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" They then took the reed from His hand and smote Him with it upon the head, causing the thorns to penetrate His temples, sending the blood trickling down His face and beard.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 170}
