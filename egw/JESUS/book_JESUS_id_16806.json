{"word": "What a grand theme this is for contemplation--the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ! Contemplating Christ and His righteousness leaves no room for self-righteousness, for the glorifying of self. In this chapter there is no standstill. There is continual advancement in every stage in the knowledge of Christ. Through the knowledge of Christ is life eternal. In His prayer Jesus says, \"This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\" (John 17:3). In God we are to glory. . . . \"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, according as it is written. He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord\" (1 Corinthians 1:30, 31). . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 159}
