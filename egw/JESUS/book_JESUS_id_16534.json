{"word": "Talk faith. Sow the seeds of faith. Reach up your hands heavenward for help. Arm yourself with the mind that was in Christ Jesus. You can place far more confidence in God, who gave His only begotten Son to die for your sin, if you will only pray to God, and not pray so much to Battle Creek, to human beings who \n68\nare erring. Join yourself to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that will not be forgotten. The Lord is willing and anxious to teach you. Will you be taught by Him, or must your teaching come by way of Battle Creek? You have the privilege of becoming strong in God, or you may choose to depend upon the powers in Battle Creek, and grow weak and uncertain.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 67}
