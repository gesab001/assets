{"word": "Love of Jesus Moves Hearts.--God and His beloved Son must be presented before the people in the wealth of the love they have evidenced for man. In order to break down the barriers of prejudice and impenitence the love of Christ must have a part in every discourse. Make men to know how much Jesus loves them, and what evidences He has given them of His love. What love can equal that which God has manifested for man by the death of Christ on the cross. When the heart is filled with the love of Jesus, this can be presented to the people and it will affect hearts.--Letter 48, 1886. \n                                                                           286", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 285}
