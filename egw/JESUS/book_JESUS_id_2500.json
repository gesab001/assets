{"word": "Dear Sister Chapman:  I think of you every day and sympathize with you. What can I say to you in this, the greatest sorrow that has come to you in your life?  Words fail me at this time. I can only commend you to God and to a compassionate Saviour. In Him is rest and peace. From Him you may receive your consolation. Jesus loves\n221\nand pities as we have no power to do. Jesus Christ Himself does sustain you; His everlasting arms are beneath, His words can heal. We cannot possibly penetrate into the secret councils of God. The disappointments and distress and perplexities, the bereavements we meet, are not to drive us from God but bring us nearer to Him.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 220}
