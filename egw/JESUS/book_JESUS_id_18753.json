{"word": "We are to receive the Holy Ghost. We have had an idea that this gift of God was not for such as we are, that the gift of the Holy Spirit was too sacred, too holy for us; but the Holy Spirit is the Comforter that Christ promised to His disciples to bring all things to their remembrance, whatsoever He had said unto them. Then let us cease to look to ourselves, but look to Him from whom all virtue comes. No one can make himself better, but we are to come to Jesus as we are, earnestly desiring to be cleansed from every spot and stain of sin, and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. We are not to doubt His mercy, and say, \"I do not know whether I shall be saved or not.\" By living faith we must lay hold of His promise, for He has said, \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 296}
