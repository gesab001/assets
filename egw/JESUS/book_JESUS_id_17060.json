{"word": "Do not dishonor Jesus by doubting His precious promises.  He wants us to believe in Him with unwavering faith. There is a class who say, \"I believe, I believe,\" and claim all the promises which are given on condition of obedience. While they claim everything in the promises of God, they do not the works of Christ. God is not honored by any such faith, it is a spurious faith. Then we see a people trying to keep all of God's  commandments, but there are many of these who do not come up to  their exalted privileges and claim nothing. God's promises are to those who keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 9}
