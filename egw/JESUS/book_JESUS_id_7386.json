{"word": "The fall of our first parents broke the golden chain of implicit obedience of the human will to the divine. Obedience has no longer been deemed an absolute necessity. The human agents follow their own imaginations which the Lord said of the inhabitants of the old world was evil and that continually. The Lord Jesus declares, I have kept my Father's commandments. How? As a man! \"Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.\" To the accusations of the Jews He stood forth in His pure, virtuous, holy character and challenged them, \"Which of you convinceth me of sin?\" The world's Redeemer came not only to be a sacrifice for sin, but to be an example to man in all things. He was a teacher, such an educator as the world never saw or heard before. He spoke as one having authority, and yet He invites the confidence of all. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 169}
