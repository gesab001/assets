{"word": "We want more, much more, of the spirit of Christ, and less, much less, of self and the peculiarities of character which keep us apart from our fellow-men. We can do much to break down these barriers by revealing the grace of Christ in our own lives. Jesus has intrusted his goods to the church, age after age. One generation after another for over eighteen hundred years has been gathering up this hereditary trust, until the increasing responsibilities have descended to the people of our time. Do we now realize our responsibility? Do we feel that we are stewards of God's grace? Do we believe that the lowest, humblest service will be accepted, if it is only directed to doing, not our own, but our Master's will, to promote his glory? We must be clothed, not with our own garments, but with the robe of Christ's righteousness.\\97MS.
