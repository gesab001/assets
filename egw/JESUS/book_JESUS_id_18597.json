{"word": "John says, \"This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him\" (1 John 5:14, 15). Let us dwell much upon these points before the people, that their ideas may be enlarged, their faith increased. They should be encouraged to ask largely, and expect without a doubt the riches of His grace; for through Jesus we can come into the audience chamber of the Most High. Through His merits we have access by one Spirit unto the Father.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 94}
