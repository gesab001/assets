{"word": "Christ proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection, and the life.\" He, the world's Redeemer, has bruised the serpent's head, depriving him of all power ever to make men feel his scorpion sting; for He has brought life and immortality to light. The gates of eternal life are thrown open to all who believe on Jesus Christ. . . . In dying, Jesus has made it impossible for those who believe on Him to die eternally. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 345}
