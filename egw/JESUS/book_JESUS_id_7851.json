{"word": "Soon appeared the great white cloud. It looked more lovely than ever before. On it sat the Son of man. At first we did not see Jesus on the cloud, but as it drew near the earth we could behold His lovely person. . . . The voice of the Son of God called forth the sleeping saints, clothed with glorious immortality. The living saints were changed in a moment and were caught up with them into the cloudy chariot. It looked all over glorious as it rolled upward. On either side of the chariot were wings, and beneath it wheels. And as the chariot rolled upward, the wheels cried, \"Holy,\" and the wings, as they moved, cried, \"Holy,\" and the retinue of holy angels around the cloud cried, \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!\" And the saints in the cloud cried, \"Glory! Alleluia!\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Mar", "page": 305}
