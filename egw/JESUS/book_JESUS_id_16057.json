{"word": "If ever a people needed to walk in humility before God, it is His church, His chosen ones in this generation. We all need to bewail the dullness of our intellectual faculties, the lack of appreciation of our privileges and opportunities. We have nothing whereof to boast. We grieve the Lord Jesus Christ by our harshness, by our un-Christlike thrusts. We need to become complete in Him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "9T", "page": 243}
