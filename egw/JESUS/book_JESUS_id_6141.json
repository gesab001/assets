{"word": "GOD TELLS HIS PEOPLE THE DAY AND HOUR OF JESUS\\92 COMING.\\97The voice of God is heard from heaven, declaring the day and hour of Jesus\\92 coming, and delivering the everlasting covenant to His people. Like peals of loudest thunder His words roll through the earth. The Israel of God stand listening, with their eyes fixed upward. Their countenances are lighted up with His glory, and shine as did the face of Moses when he came down from Sinai. The wicked cannot look upon them. And when the blessing is pronounced on those who have honored God by keeping His Sabbath holy, there is a mighty shout of victory.\\97GC 640.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 30}
