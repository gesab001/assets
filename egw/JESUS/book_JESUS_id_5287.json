{"word": "The Lord Jesus has made His church the depositary of sacred truth. He has left with her the work of carrying out His purposes and His plans to save the souls for whom He has manifested such interest, such unmeasured love. Like the sun in relation to our world, He rises amid the moral darkness--the Sun of Righteousness. He said of Himself, \"I am the light of the world\" (John 8:12). He said to His followers, \"Ye are the light of the world\" (Matthew 5:14). . . . By reflecting the image of Jesus Christ, by the beauty and holiness of their characters, by their continual self-denial and their separation from all idols, large or small, they reveal that they have learned in the school of Christ.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 301}
