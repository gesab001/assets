{"word": "Do not murmur nor find fault. . . . The image of Christ is engraven upon the soul [that looks upon Jesus] and reflected back in spirit, in words, in true service for our fellow beings. Christ's joy is in our hearts, and our joy is full. This is true religion. Let us make sure to obtain it, and to be kind, to be courteous, to have love in the soul--that kind of love which flows forth and is expressed in good works, which is a light to shine to the world, and which makes our joy full.--Manuscript 26, 1889.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 277}
