{"word": "Satan is ever seeking to destroy; he is casting his hellish shadow between our souls and the light of the Sun of Righteousness. When you talk doubts, and distrust your heavenly Father's love, Satan comes in and deepens the impression, and that which is shadowed is made the blackness of despair. Now, your only hope is to cease talking darkness. In dwelling on the dark side, you cast away your confidence in God, and this is just what Satan wants you to do. He wants to sift you as wheat; but Jesus is making intercession for you; His love is broad and deep. Perhaps you will say, \"How do you know He loves me?\" I look where you may look, to the cross of Calvary. That blood shed upon the cross cleanseth from all sin. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 163}
