{"word": "How to Visit\n     Much depends upon the manner in which you meet those whom you visit. We should manifest cheerfulness in our work. You can take hold of the hand in such a way as at once to gain the confidence, or in a cold, unimpressive manner, as though you were an iceberg, and had no interest in the person. Such a manner will repulse, and you will find no warmth of feeling. We should not act as though it were a condescension to come in contact with the poor. They are as good by nature as we, and we must talk to them as though we thought them so. We should clothe ourselves in plain, simple attire, so that none may be needlessly embarrassed. The joy which comes into the homes of the poor is often very limited, and why not carry rays of light to shine in upon them and fill their hearts! What we need is the tender sympathy of Jesus; then we can win our way to the hardest heart.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 395}
