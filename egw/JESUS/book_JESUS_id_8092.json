{"word": "Chap. 44 - Self-Denial\n\n     Jesus emptied Himself, and in all that He did self did not appear. He subordinated all things to the will of His Father. When His mission on earth was about to close, He could say, \"I have glorified Thee on the earth: I have finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do.\" And He bids us, \"Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself\"; let self be dethroned, and no longer hold the supremacy of the soul.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 162}
