{"word": "Jesus of Nazareth declared Himself the Light of the world. What think ye of Him? What position does He occupy among the world's religious teachers? Hundreds, yes thousands, of men are recognized as having been great thinkers, men who speculated, who published their theories, and charmed the minds of many with their intellectual and moral attainments. These so-called great men who have left to the world the productions of their life of thought have been ranked as the wisest men the world has ever known. But these cannot compare with Christ. There was a revelation before man's productions were brought forth. His finite knowledge is but the result of beholding the wondrous things that have been shining in our world contained in the teachings of Christ, the greatest of all teachers. Whatever great ideas man may have evolved have come through Christ. Every precious gem of thought every flash of the intellect, is revealed by the Light of the world. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 97}
