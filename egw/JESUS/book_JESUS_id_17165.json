All may be admitted into His kingdom who will receive His message and His Messenger. This is the day of your visitation.\" They were to present the truth of God in such a manner that the people might be led to lay hold upon the blessings placed within their reach.--Letter 119, April 14, 1905, to the members of the Nashville church.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 113}
