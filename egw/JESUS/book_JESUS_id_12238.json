{"word": "The old sinful life is dead; the new life entered into with Christ by the pledge of baptism. Practise the virtues of the Saviour's character. Let His wisdom dwell in you richly in all wisdom; \"teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.\" . . . The sins that were practised before conversion, are to be put off, with the old man. With the new man, Christ Jesus, are to be put on \"kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 300}
