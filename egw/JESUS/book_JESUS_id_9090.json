{"word": "For sinful men, the highest consolation, the greatest cause of rejoicing, is that Heaven has given Jesus to be the sinner\\92s Saviour. . . . He offered to go over the ground where Adam stumbled and fell; to meet the tempter on the field of battle, and conquer him in man\\92s behalf. Behold Him in the wilderness of temptation. Forty days and forty nights He fasted, enduring the fiercest assaults of the powers of darkness. He trod the \\93winepress \n210\nalone; and of the people there was none with\\94 Him (Isaiah 63:3). It was not for Himself, but that He might break the chain that held the human race in slavery to Satan.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 209}
