{"word": "The Lord has made every provision so that we may have a rich, abundant, joyful experience. John writes concerning Christ, saying, \"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\" Life is associated with light, and if we have no light from the Sun of Righteousness, we can have no life in Him. But this light has been provided for every soul, and it is only as we withdraw from the light that darkness comes upon us. Jesus said, \"He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" In the world about us there can be no life without light. Were the sun to withdraw his shining, all vegetation, all animal life, would have an end. This illustrates the fact that we cannot have spiritual life unless we place ourselves under the beams of the Sun of Righteousness. If we put a flowering plant in a dark room, it will soon wither and die; and so we may have some spiritual life, and yet lose it by dwelling in an atmosphere of doubt and gloom. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 281}
