{"word": "Those who apostatize are voicing the words of the dragon. We have to meet the satanic agencies who went to make war with the saints. \"The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ\" (Revelation 12:17). Those who apostatize leave the true and faithful people of God, and fraternize with those who represent Barabbas. \"By their fruits ye shall know them\" (Matthew 7:20).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 395}
