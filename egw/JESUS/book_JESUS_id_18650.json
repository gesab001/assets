There seemed to be no special effort on the part of the teachers to influence the students to give their attention to the things of God, but God had a Watcher in the school, and though His presence was unseen, yet His influence was discernible. Again and again there have been manifest tokens of the presence of the holy Watchman in the school. Again and again the voice of Jesus has spoken to the students, saying,  \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me\" (Revelation 3:20).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 145}
