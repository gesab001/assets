{"word": "Come to Jesus, and receive rest and peace. You may have the blessing even now. Satan suggests that you are helpless, and cannot bless yourself. It is true; you are helpless. But lift up Jesus before him: \\93I have a risen Saviour. In him I trust, and he will never suffer me to be confounded. In his name I triumph. He is my righteousness, and my crown of rejoicing.\\94 Let no one here feel that his case is hopeless; for it is not. You may see that you are sinful and undone; but it is just on this account that you need a Saviour. If you have sins to \n414\nconfess, lose no time. These moments are golden. \\93If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\\94 [1 John 1:9.] Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness will be filled; for Jesus has promised it. Precious Saviour! his arms are open to receive us, and his great heart of love is waiting to bless us.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 413}
