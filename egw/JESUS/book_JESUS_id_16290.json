{"word": "Jesus is acquainted with every heart that is humble, meek, and lowly. These have trials and make mistakes, but they are brokenhearted because they grieve the Saviour who loved them and died for them. They come humbly to His feet; they fight His battles. In meekness and lowliness of heart they seek to do good to others. They seek to advance the cause of truth in good and earnest endeavor.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 129}
