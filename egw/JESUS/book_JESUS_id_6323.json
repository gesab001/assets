{"word": "As workers, let us seek the Lord together. Of our own selves we can do nothing; but through Christ we can do all things. God intends that we shall be a help and blessing to one another, and that we shall be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. In the hour of our deepest trial, Jesus will be our \\93bright and morning star.\\94 There is in life much sorrow of our own creating. Satan works up distrust and discouragement. But God lives and reigns; and he will give us all the help we need. It is our privilege at all times to draw strength and encouragement from his blessed promise, \\93My grace is sufficient for you.\\94 \n     Monday morning, Sept. 21.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 129}
