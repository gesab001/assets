{"word": "As the priests and Pharisees were consulting together, some of them said, \"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans shall come, and take away both our place and nation.\" Then Caiaphas spoke out loftily: \"Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.\" The voice of the high priest decided the matter; even if Jesus was innocent, let him die; he was troublesome, drawing the people to himself, and lessening the authority of the rulers. He was only one, it was better that he should die, even though he was guiltless, than that the power of the rulers should diminish. Caiaphas, in declaring that one man should die for the nation, indicated that he had some knowledge of the prophecies, although it was very limited; but John in his account of this scene takes up the prophecy, and shows its broad and deep significance in these words: \"And not for that nation \n                                                                           370\nonly, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.\" How blindly did the haughty Caiaphas acknowledge the mission of Jesus as a Redeemer!", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 369}
