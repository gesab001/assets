{"word": "These blessings we need. We need the water of life that flows from Jesus Christ, which will be in us a well of water springing up into everlasting life. \"The Lord shall guide thee continually.\" When we are guided by the Lord, we shall have clear discernment. We shall not call righteousness unrighteousness, nor think that things that the Lord has forbidden are right. We shall understand where the Lord is working.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4BC", "page": 1152}
