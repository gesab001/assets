{"word": "Again: it is written, \"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God\" (John 1:12, 13). Jesus declared, \"Except a man be born again, \n                                                                           102\nhe cannot see the kingdom of God\" (John 3:3). \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God\" (verse 5). It is not a low standard that is placed before us, for we are to become the children of God. We are to be saved as individuals, and in the day of test and trial we shall be able to discern between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not. We are saved as individual believers in the Lord Jesus Christ.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 101}
