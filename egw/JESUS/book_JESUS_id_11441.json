{"word": "Chapter 27 \n\n     15-26 (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:18-25; 18:39, 40). A Symbol of Last Days.--The scene in the judgment hall in Jerusalem is a symbol of what will take place in the closing scenes of this earth's history. The world will accept Christ, the Truth, or they will accept Satan, the first great rebel, a robber, apostate, and murderer. They will either reject the message of mercy in regard to the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, or they will accept the truth as it is in Jesus. If they accept Satan and his falsehoods, they identify themselves with the chief of all liars, and with all who are disloyal, while they turn from no less a personage than the Son of the infinite God (RH Jan. 30, 1900).", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1105}
