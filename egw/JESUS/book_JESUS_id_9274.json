{"word": "You must consider that you are not at your own disposal to do that which you please for your own self. You are the Lord's property. Christ has purchased you with the price of His own blood. Your body is to be sanctified unto the Lord as a vessel unto honor. It is Christ's purchased possession. Then preserve every power, every organ, as an instrument unto righteousness. Satan desires to have your brain power, and your will, but they belong to Jesus. Consider always, \"I am not my own. I must carefully and holily cherish every part of Christ's purchased possession.\" . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 41}
