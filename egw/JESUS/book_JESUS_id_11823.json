{"word": "I saw that the saints will rest in the Holy City, \n33\nand reign as kings and priests one thousand years; then Jesus will descend with the saints upon the mount of Olives, and the mount will part asunder, and become a mighty plain for the Paradise of God to rest upon. The rest of the earth will not be cleansed until the wicked dead are raised (at the end of the one thousand years) and gather up around the City; for the feet of the wicked will never desecrate the earth made new. Then fire will come down from God out of heaven and devour them; burn them up root and branch. Satan is the root, and his children are the branches. The same fire that will devour the wicked, will purify the earth. Yours in hope of immortality at the appearing of Jesus, E. G. W.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "ExV", "page": 32}
