{"word": "Chap. 21 - Illustrations, Symbols, and Figures of Speech\n\n     Well-Chosen Illustrations--Jesus was the greatest teacher the world ever knew. He presented truth in clear, forcible statements, and the illustrations He used were of the purest and highest order. He never mingled cheap symbols and figures with His divine instruction, or sought to pander to curiosity or to gratify the class that will listen simply to be amused. He did not bring sacred truth down to the level of the common, and the comical illustrations that some ministers of the gospel use were never uttered by His divine lips. Christ did not employ illustrations that would create amusement and excite laughter.--RH Aug. 6, 1895.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 104}
