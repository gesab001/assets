{"word": "When Christ came to speak the words of life, the common people heard him gladly; and many, even of the priests and rulers, believed on him. But the chief of the priesthood and the leading men of the nation were determined to condemn and repudiate his teachings. Though they were baffled in all their efforts to find accusations against him, though they could not but feel the influence of the divine power and wisdom attending his words, yet they encased themselves in prejudice; they rejected the clearest evidence of his Messiahship, lest they should be forced to become his disciples. These opponents of Jesus were men whom the people had been taught from infancy to reverence, to whose authority they had been accustomed implicitly to bow. \"How is it,\" they asked, \"that our rulers and learned scribes do not believe on Jesus? Would not these pious men receive him if he were the Christ?\" It was the influence of such teachers that led the Jewish nation to reject their Redeemer.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 414}
