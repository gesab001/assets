{"word": "\"The prince of this world cometh,\" said Jesus, \"and hath nothing in me.\" There was in Him nothing that responded to Satan's sophistry. He did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did He yield to temptation. So may it be with us. Christ's humanity was united with divinity; He was fitted for the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. . . . So long as we are united to Him by faith, sin has no more dominion over us. God reaches for the hand of faith in us to direct it to lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to perfection of character. . . . Every promise in God's Word is ours.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 308}
