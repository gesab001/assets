{"word": "At the time of his conversion, Paul was inspired with a longing desire to help his fellow men to behold Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of the living God, mighty to transform and to save. Henceforth his life was wholly devoted to an effort to portray the love and power of the Crucified One. . . . The apostle's efforts were not confined to public speaking; there were many who could not have been reached in that way. . . . He visited the sick and the sorrowing, comforted the afflicted, and lifted up the oppressed. And in all that he said and did he magnified the name of Jesus. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CC", "page": 341}
