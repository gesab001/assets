{"word": "The youth may be a power for Christ, if they will maintain their simplicity, and not seek to present something startling, something original, but teach the precepts of their Lord. But to invest the simplest truths with novelty and singularity, is to rob them of their power to win souls to Christ. . . . The use of long words and soaring eloquence is not essential to success. What you need is a living experience in the things of God, and simplicity in presenting the love of Christ to the lost. . . . When the heart is aglow with the love of Jesus, you will express it to others, and become witnesses for Christ.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 266}
