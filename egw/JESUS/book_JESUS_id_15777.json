{"word": "When John was banished from those he loved to lonely Patmos, Christ knew where to find His faithful witness. John said: \"I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.\" The Lord's day is the seventh day, the Sabbath of creation. On the day that God sanctified and blessed, Christ signified \"by His angel unto His servant John\" things which must come to pass before the close of the world's history, and He means that we should become intelligent with regard to them. It is not in vain that He declares: \"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\" Revelation 1:9, 10, 1-3. This is the education that is to be patiently given. Let our lessons be appropriate for the day in which we live, and let our religious instruction be given in accordance with the messages God sends.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "6T", "page": 128}
