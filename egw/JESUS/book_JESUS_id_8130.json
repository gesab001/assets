{"word": "Chap. 112 - A Blessing in the Home\n\n     The Lord says to the young, \"My son, give Me thine heart.\" The Saviour of the world loves to have children and youth give their hearts to Him. There may be a large army of children who shall be found faithful to God, because they walk in the light, as Christ is in the light. They will love the Lord Jesus, and it will be their delight to please Him. They will not be impatient if reproved; but will make glad the heart of father and mother by their kindness, their patience, their willingness to do all they can in helping to bear the burdens of daily life. Through childhood and youth, they will be found faithful disciples of our Lord.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 333}
