{"word": "Then trust in the Lord Jesus to lead you step by step into the right path. You can derive assurance and strength at every step you advance, for you can be assured that your hand is in His hand. You can \"run and not be weary\"; you can \"walk and not faint,\" for you can realize by faith that you have your hand in the hand of Christ. You will not sink under discouragement, for as you follow on to know the Lord, trusting in Him, you will have the assurance that the One who never forsakes those who fully trust Him is your constant Helper.--Letter 313, Nov. 2, 1905, to Mabel White, her 19-year-old granddaughter.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 320}
