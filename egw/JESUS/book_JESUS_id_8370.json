{"word": "How Ellen White Repulsed the Shadow of Doubt.-- When Satan casts his hellish shadow athwart my pathway, I do not look at it or talk of it and glorify the devil by talking of him and his power and what a hard time I am having. No, I cleave right through the shadow, and by faith take hold of Jesus Christ. By beholding we \"are changed into the same image from glory to glory.\" Talk faith. Every doubt you express is a seed sown, and that seed will take root in some heart. We do not want to speak one word of doubt and thus praise the devil for his wonderful power to keep you in subjection. No, Christ has purchased me and redeemed me. Satan has no power over me.--MS 16, 1894.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 675}
