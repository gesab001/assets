{"word": "Will you, my ministering brethren, grasp the rich promises of God? Will you put self out of sight and let Jesus appear? Self must die before God can work through you.

I beseech you to draw nigh to Him, that you may realize His rich blessing before this meeting closes.  9T 179-182533", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 288}
