{"word": "Here are the two great powers, the power of truth and righteousness and the working of Satan to make of none effect the law of God. The human agent, magnetized by the power of Satan, works in the lines of the enemy; the Saviour employs His human instrumentalities to be laborers together with God. . . . Those who expect to be children of God are not to expect an easy time in this life. . . . We are not left alone to engage in this conflict. Jesus Christ is the Captain of our salvation.\\97Manuscript 61, 1899.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 245}
