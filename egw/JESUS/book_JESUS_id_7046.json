{"word": "\\93I was shown that all who profess the present truth will be tested and tried. Their love for Jesus\\92 coming will be proved, and manifested to others, whether it be genuine. I saw, that not all will stand the test. Some love this world so much that it swallows up their love for the truth. As their treasures here increase, their interest in the heavenly treasure decreases. The more they possess of this world, the more closely do they embrace it, as if fearful that their coveted treasure would be taken from them.

They will not see and feel the wants of the cause of God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LS88", "page": 335}
