{"word": "On every occasion be armed and equipped with \"It is Written.\" God is your armor, on the right hand, and on the left.  A flood of hasty words may seek for expression, but say, No; no.  I will not place my feet on Satan's ground.  I will not sacrifice my peace and honor as a child of God.  I will keep in the only safe path, close beside Jesus, who has done so much for me. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ChL", "page": 64}
