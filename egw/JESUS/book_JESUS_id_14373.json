{"word": "Relieving the Suffering\n \n\n     Jesus began His work by breaking Satan's power over the suffering. He restored the sick to health, gave sight to the blind, and healed the lame, causing them to leap for joy and to glorify God. He restored to health those who had been infirm and bound in Satan's cruel power many years. With gracious words He comforted the weak, the trembling, and the desponding. The feeble, suffering ones whom Satan held in triumph, Jesus wrenched from his grasp, bringing to them soundness of body and great joy and happiness. He raised the dead to life, and they glorified God for\n204\nthe mighty display of His power. He wrought mightily for all who believed on Him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 203}
