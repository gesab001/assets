{"word": "John in holy vision saw a company standing around the great white throne, every one of them having white robes. The question is asked, Who are these, and whence came they? And the answer is given: \\93These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\\94 If you want to be among this company, you must not study how you can escape trials in this life. Do not keep thinking what a little company you are, but get your eyes fixed on Jesus. From his own lips the words come ringing down along the lines to our time, \\93He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.\\94", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 233}
