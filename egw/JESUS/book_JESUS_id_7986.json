By beholding Him you will become changed into His likeness. . . . You may have a theoretical knowledge of the truth, but this will not save you. You must know by experience how sinful sin is and how much you need Jesus as a personal Saviour. Only thus can you become sons and daughters of God. Your only merit is your great need.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 217}
