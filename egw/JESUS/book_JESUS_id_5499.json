{"word": "Talent is too much idolized, and station too much coveted, even among Seventh-day Adventists. There is too eager a desire to ride upon the high places of the earth, and too little willingness to follow the Saviour in the path of cross-bearing and humility. There are too many who will do nothing unless they can be leaders; too many who must be praised and petted, or they have no interest to labor. To work in a humble way for Jesus, and, though unnoticed, to still work on, sowing the seeds of truth, appears to them an unattractive and unwelcome task.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 381}
