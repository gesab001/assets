{"word": "PRAY FOR GRACE TO RESIST TEMPTATION.\\97In the daily life you will meet with sudden surprises, disappointments, and temptations. What saith the word? \\93Resist the devil,\\94 by firm reliance upon God, \\93and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.\\94\\93Let him take hold of My strength, that he \n69\nmay make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\\94 Look unto Jesus at all times and in all places, offering a silent prayer from a sincere heart that you may know how to do His will. Then when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard for you against the enemy. When you are almost ready to yield, to lose patience and self-control, to be hard and denunciatory, to find fault and accuse\\97this is the time for you to send to heaven the prayer, \\93Help me, O God, to resist temptation, to put all bitterness and wrath and evil-speaking out of my heart. Give me Thy meekness, Thy lowliness, Thy longsuffering, and Thy love. Leave me not to dishonor my Redeemer, to misinterpret the words and motives of my wife, my children, and my brethren and sisters in the faith. Help me that I may be kind, pitiful, tenderhearted, forgiving. Help me to be a real house-band in my home and to represent the character of Christ to others.\\94(Adventist Home, 214, 215.)", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 68}
