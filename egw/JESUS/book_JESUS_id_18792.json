{"word": "He who opens the Scriptures, and feeds upon the heavenly manna, becomes a partaker of the divine nature. He has no life or experience apart from Christ. He hears the voice of God speaking from heaven, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\" (Matthew 3:17). That voice is assurance to him that he is accepted in the Beloved. And he knows that in character he must be like Him with whom God is well pleased. God has fully accepted Christ as our substitute, our surety; then let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from all iniquity, and be one with Christ in character, that Jesus may not be ashamed to call us brethren.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 347}
