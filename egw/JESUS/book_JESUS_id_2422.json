{"word": "All Who Seek Jesus Find Him.--Is there no time to pray?  No time to tell the Lord, \"Thou must keep me by Thine own power\"?  Leaving the Lord out of sight will not lessen the cares but multiply them. A Christian spirit is as essential in active business lines as is having the Spirit of God in the place where prayer is wont to be made. All any of us need is to seek the Lord, and the grace of the Christian will be evidenced. All who seek Him find Jesus a very present help in every time of need.--21MR 358 (1898).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 83}
