{"word": "24 (John 15:4; Ephesians 1:6; Colossians 2:10; see EGW on Romans 8:26, 34; Ephesians 2:18; Hebrews 7:25; 1 John 2:1). Jesus Stands in the Holy of Holies.--Jesus stands in the holy of holies, now to appear in the presence of God for us. There He ceases not to present His people moment by moment, complete in Himself. But because we are thus represented before the Father, we are not to imagine that we are to presume upon His mercy, and become careless, indifferent, and self-indulgent. Christ is not the minister of sin. We are complete in Him, accepted in the Beloved, only as we abide in Him by faith (ST July 4, 1892).", "paragraph": 9, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 933}
