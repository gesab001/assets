{"word": "50: Adult Sabbath School\n \n\n     Sabbath school work to bear fruit.--Consecrate yourself and your all to the service of Him who hath loved you, and hath given Himself for you. Jesus says, \"Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples.\" This means in the Sabbath school work as much as in the work of the minister. Now is the golden opportunity to sow precious seed that will spring up and bear fruit unto eternal life.--CSW 181.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 273}
