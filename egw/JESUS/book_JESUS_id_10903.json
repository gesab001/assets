{"word": "Chap. 61 - Christ the Center of the\nMessage\n[THIS ARTICLE APPEARED IN\nTHE REVIEW AND HERALD, MARCH 20, 1894.]\n\n     The third angel's message calls for the presentation of the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and this truth must be brought before the world; but the great center of attraction, Jesus Christ, must not be left out of the third angel's message. By many who have been engaged in the work for this time, Christ has been made secondary, and theories and arguments have had first place. The glory of God that was revealed to Moses in regard to the divine character has not been made prominent. The Lord said to Moses, \"I will make all my goodness pass before thee\" (Exodus 33:19). \"And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty\" (Exodus 34:6, 7).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 383}
