{"word": "Let the affliction that has come to your family circle be a blessing to you all. Our dear sister, your mother, loved Jesus. Her warfare is ended. You are to remember that she rests in hope. \"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him\" (Colossians 3:4). Let the peace and comfort of the Holy Spirit come into your hearts. Open the door of your hearts, that Jesus may enter as an honored guest, and you will have a Comforter. \"This is my commandment, That ye love one another\" (John 15:12). Let the hearts of the living draw close to one another. Let each try to be a blessing to the other, and not a hindrance. . . .", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 34}
