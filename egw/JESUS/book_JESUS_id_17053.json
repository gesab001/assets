Because of sin the Majesty of heaven was stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. Voluntarily our divine Substitute bared His soul to the sword of justice, that we might not perish but have everlasting life. Said Christ: \"I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself\" (John 10:17, 18). . . . No man of earth nor angel of heaven could have paid the penalty of sin. Jesus was the only one who could save rebellious man.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 368}
