{"word": "The Conversion of Saul\n\n\n     As Saul journeyed to Damascus, with letters authorizing him to take men or women who were preaching Jesus, and bring them bound to Jerusalem, evil angels exulted around him. But suddenly a light from heaven shone round about him, which made the evil angels flee and caused him to fall quickly to the ground. He heard a voice saying, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?\" Saul inquired, \"Who art Thou, Lord?\" And the Lord said, \"I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.\" And Saul, trembling and astonished, said, \"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\" And the Lord said, \"Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 200}
