{"word": "The Ascension of Christ\n\n\n     All heaven was waiting the hour of triumph when Jesus should ascend to His Father. Angels came to receive the King of glory and to escort Him triumphantly to heaven. After Jesus had blessed His disciples, He was parted from them and taken up. And as He led the way upward, the multitude of captives who were raised at His resurrection followed. A multitude of the heavenly host were in attendance, while in heaven an innumerable company of angels awaited His coming. As they ascended to the Holy City, the angels who escorted Jesus cried out, \"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.\" The angels in the city cried out with rapture, \"Who is this \n                                                                           191\nKing of glory?\" The escorting angels answered in triumph, \"The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle! Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in!\" Again the waiting angels asked, \"Who is this King of glory?\" and the escorting angels answered in melodious strains, \"The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.\" And the heavenly train passed into the city of God. Then all the heavenly host surrounded their majestic Commander, and with the deepest adoration bowed before Him and cast their glittering crowns at His feet. And then they touched their golden harps, and in sweet, melodious strains filled all heaven with rich music and songs to the Lamb who was slain, yet lives again in majesty and glory.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 190}
