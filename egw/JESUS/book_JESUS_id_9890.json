{"word": "DAILY PRAYER TURNS MISTAKES INTO VICTORIES.\\97If one who daily communes with God errs from the path, if he turns a moment from looking steadfastly unto Jesus, it is not because he sins willfully; for when he sees his mistake, he turns again, and fastens his eyes upon Jesus, and the fact that he has erred, does not make him less dear to the heart of God. He knows that he has communion\n66\nwith the Saviour; and when reproved for his mistake in some matter of judgment, he does not walk sullenly, and complain of God, but turns the mistake into a victory. He learns a lesson from the words of the Master, and takes heed that he be not again deceived.\\97(Review and Herald, May 12, 1896.)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 65}
