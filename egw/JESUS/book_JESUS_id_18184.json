{"word": "All who desire to be among the number who will stand before God without fault must begin without delay the practical work of overcoming. The Lord permits trials to come in order that we may be cleansed from earthliness, from selfishness, from harsh un-Christlikeness of character. He desires to create in every heart a deep and earnest longing to be cleansed from every stain of sin, that we may come forth purer, holier, and happier from every trial which He permits. Our souls become darkened by selfishness, but if we can only see Jesus, there will be a dying to self. Changes will be made in word and action. If we are patient under the crucial test, we shall come forth reflecting the image of the Master. \"He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday\" (Psalm 37:6). \"Righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne\" (Psalm 97:2).--Manuscript 61, Oct. 11, 1900, untitled manuscript.", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 298}
