{"word": "O how much we need a more intimate acquaintance with the Lord Jesus. We need to enter into His will and carry out His purposes, saying with the whole heart, \"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\" O how I long to see our churches in a condition different from the condition in which they now are--grieving the Holy Spirit day by day with their lukewarm religious life, a life neither cold nor hot. Christ says, \"I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth\" (Revelation 3:15, 16).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 64}
