He came to redeem it from the curse of sin and the penalty of transgression, that the transgressor might be forgiven. He planted the cross between earth and heaven, and between divinity and humanity; and as the Father beheld the cross, He was satisfied. He said, \"It is enough, the offering is complete.\" God and man may be reconciled. Those who have lived in rebellion against God, may become reconciled, if as they see the cross, they become repentant, and accept the great propitiation that Christ has made for their sins. In the cross they see that \"mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other\" (ST Sept. 30, 1889).", "paragraph": 9, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1137}
