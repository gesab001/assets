{"word": "Enoch kept the Lord ever before him, and the Inspired Word says that he \"walked with God.\" He made Christ his constant companion. He was in the world, and performed his duties to the world; but he was ever under the influence of Jesus. He reflected Christ's character, exhibiting the same qualities in goodness, mercy, tender compassion, sympathy, forbearance, meekness, humility, and love. His association with Christ day by day transformed him into the image of Him with whom he was so intimately connected. Day by day he was growing away from his own way into Christ's way, the heavenly, the divine, in his thoughts and feelings. . . . His was a constant growth and he had fellowship with the Father and the Son. This is genuine sanctification.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 337}
