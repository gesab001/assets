{"word": "I asked Jesus to let me eat of the fruit. He said: \"Not now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land, go back to earth no more. But in a little while, if faithful, you shall both eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and drink of the water of the fountain.\" And He said, \"You must go back to the earth again, and relate to others what I have revealed to you.\" Then an angel bore me gently down to this dark world.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 64}
