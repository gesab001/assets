{"word": "Addie, make your aim to be a noble woman, a sincere Christian. Have the truth at heart. I do want you to know for yourself the preciousness of a Saviour's love. If Jesus is formed within, the hope of glory, you will surely reveal Christ in speaking of Him; if His peace is in your heart you will surely express the same in your words and in your actions. Be true to yourself and be humble. Be not forward in speech, but be modest; never praise yourself, but think less and less of self and talk less of self, and lay all your burdens upon Jesus. May the Lord help you to win eternal life. . . . \n                                               In much love, \n                                             Your Aunt Ellen\n--Letter 92, Jan. 29, 1886, to Addie Walling, a daughter of Ellen White's niece, whom, with her sister May, she took into her home to rear.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 37}
