{"word": "I saw that many were fair in their profession, but within is corruption. Deceive not yourselves, false-hearted professors. God looks at the heart. \"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\" The world, I saw, was in the heart of such, but the religion of Jesus is not there. If the professed christian loves Jesus better than the world, he will love to speak of him, his best friend in whom his highest affections are centered.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 259}
