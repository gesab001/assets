{"word": "Will it make you sad to be buffeted, despised, derided, maligned by the world? It ought not; for Jesus told us just how it would be. \\93If the world hate you,\\94 he says, \\93ye know that it hated me before it hated you.\\94 The apostle Paul, the great hero of faith, testifies, \\93For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\\94 \\93For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\\94 [John 15:18; Romans 8:18; 2 Corinthians 4:17.] Look up, my brethren, look up. Let the love of God into your souls. Through Jesus the treasures of heaven are at our command, and what is there that he will not do for us? The Father also loves us, and is waiting to be gracious. \\93He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\\94 [Romans 8:32.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 468}
