{"word": "Oh, that we may have a deeper experience in prayer! With confidence we may come to God, knowing what it is to have the presence and power of His Holy Spirit. We may confess our sins, and right there, while asking, know that He pardons our transgressions, because He has promised to forgive. We must exercise faith, and manifest true earnestness and humility. We can never do this without the grace of the Holy Spirit. We must lie low at the feet of Jesus, and cherish no selfishness, reveal no self-uplifting, but in simplicity seek the Lord, asking for His Holy Spirit as a little child asks bread of his parents.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 94}
