{"word": "We must cherish and cultivate the faith of which prophets and apostles have testified\\97the faith that lays hold on the promises of God and waits for deliverance in His appointed time and way. The sure word of prophecy will meet its final fulfillment in the glorious advent of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, as King of kings and Lord of lords. . . . With the prophet who endeavored to encourage Judah in a time of unparalleled apostasy, let us confidently declare, \\93The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.\\94 Let us ever hold in remembrance the cheering message, \\93The vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come.\\94", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 188}
