{"word": "The widowed mother had mourned over the sufferings that  Jesus had endured in His loneliness. His Messiahship had caused her deep sorrow as well as joy. Yet strangely, as it appears to her, she meets Him  at the marriage feast, the same tender, dutiful son, yet not the same, for His countenance is changed; she sees the marks of His fierce conflict in the wilderness of temptation, and the evidence of His high mission in His holy expression and the gentle dignity of His presence. She sees that He is accompanied by a number of young men who address Him with reverence, calling Him Master. These companions tell Mary of the wonderful things they have witnessed, not only at the baptism, but upon numerous other occasions, and they conclude by saying, \"We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, who is the long-looked-for Messiah.\"--2SP 100 (1877).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 54}
