Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.\" Again the waiting angels asked, \"Who is this King of glory?\" and the escorting angels answered in melodious strains, \"The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.\" Psalm 24:7-10. And the heavenly train passed into the city of God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 239}
