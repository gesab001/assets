{"word": "The Example of Jesus \n\n     Jesus reproved self-indulgence in all its forms, yet He was social in His nature. He accepted the hospitality of all classes, visiting the homes of the rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, and seeking to elevate their thoughts from questions of commonplace life to those things that are spiritual and eternal. He gave no license to dissipation, and no shadow of worldly levity marred His conduct; yet he found pleasure in scenes of innocent happiness, and by His presence sanctioned the social gathering. --\"Desire of Ages,\" pp. 150, 151.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 384}
