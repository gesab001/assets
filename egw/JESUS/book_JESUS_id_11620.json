{"word": "18 (chs. 1:6; 3:12; Hebrews 4:15, 16; 9:14). The Merits of Christ's Name.--We have access to God through the merits of the name of Christ, and God invites us to bring to Him our trials and temptations; for He understands them all. He would not have us pour out our woes to human ears. Through the blood of Christ we may come to the throne of grace, and find grace to help in time of need. We may come with assurance, saying, \"My acceptance is in the Beloved.\" \"For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.\" \"In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.\" As an earthly parent encourages his child to come to him at all times, so the Lord encourages us to lay before Him our wants and perplexities, our gratitude and love. Every promise is sure. Jesus is our Surety and Mediator, and has placed at our command every resource, that we may have a perfect character. The blood of Christ in ever-abiding efficacy is our only hope; for through His merits alone we have pardon and peace. When the efficiency of the blood of Christ becomes a reality to the soul through faith in Christ, the believer will let his light shine forth in good works, in bringing forth fruits unto righteousness (YI Sept. 22, 1892).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1116}
