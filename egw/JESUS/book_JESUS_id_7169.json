Shall we seek to make the world our standard? or shall we come out from among them? The invitation is, 'Come out from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters.' 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 292}
