{"word": "We need to educate the soul to lay hold, and hold fast the rich promises of Christ. The Lord Jesus knows that it is not possible for us to resist the many temptations of Satan, only as we shall have divine power given us from God. He well knows that in our own human strength we should surely fail. Therefore every provision has been made, that in every emergency and trial we shall flee to the Stronghold.... We have the word of promise from lips that will not lie. . . . We must individually cherish the faith that we receive of Him the things He hath promised.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 99}
