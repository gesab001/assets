{"word": "Dear children, will not such a precious commendation from Jesus be worth a great deal more than for you to have your own will here, \n60\nand to give up to sin and temptation, and to have no thoughts of God or heaven, and make those unhappy around you, and at last be separated from Jesus, destroyed with the wicked, and miserably perish from the earth? Is not heaven worth making an effort for? Oh children, reflect seriously, soberly; and remember if you are saved at last you must form a character for heaven. I will leave this matter with you for you to ponder upon.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AY", "page": 59}
