{"word": "Christ's followers are to be more than a light in the midst of men. They are the light of the world. Jesus says to all who have named His name, You have given yourselves to Me, and I have given you to the world as My representatives. As the Father had sent Him into the world, so He declares, \"have I also sent them into the world.\" . . . While our Saviour is the great source of illumination, forget not, O Christian, that He is revealed through humanity. God's blessings are bestowed through human instrumentality. . . . Angels of glory wait to communicate through you heaven's light and power to souls that are ready to perish. . . . If Christ is dwelling in the heart, it is impossible to conceal the light of His presence.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 138}
