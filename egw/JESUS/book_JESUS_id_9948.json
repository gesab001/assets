{"word": "\\93It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord.\\94 Our tables are frequently spread with luxuries neither healthful nor necessary, because we love these things more than we love self-denial, freedom from disease, and soundness of mind. Jesus sought earnestly for strength from His Father. This the divine Son of God considered of more value, even for Himself, than to sit at the most luxurious table. He has given us evidence that prayer is essential in order to receive strength to contend with the powers of darkness, and to do the work allotted us. Our own strength is weakness, but that which God gives is mighty and will make everyone who obtains it more than conqueror.\\97(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, 201-203.)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 174}
