{"word": "In this world these heroes of faith were counted unworthy of life; but in heaven they are enrolled as sons of God, worthy of the highest honor. \"They shall walk with me in white,\" Christ declares: \"for they are worthy\" (Revelation 3:4). In the courts of heaven there awaits them an \"eternal weight of glory.\" \"Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith\" (Hebrews 12:1). \"Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal\" (2 Corinthians 4:17, 18).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 268}
