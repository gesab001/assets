{"word": "In the love of God has been opened the most marvelous vein of precious truth, and the treasures of the grace of Christ are laid open before the church and the world. \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son...\" (John 3:16). What love is this--what marvelous, unfathomable love--that would lead Christ to die for us while we were yet sinners! What a loss it is to the soul who understands the strong claims of the law, and who yet fails to understand the grace of Christ which doth much more abound! It is true that the law of God reveals the love of God when it is preached as the truth in Jesus; for the gift of Christ to this guilty world must be largely dwelt upon in every discourse. It is no wonder that hearts have not been melted by the truth, when it has been presented in a cold and lifeless manner. No wonder faith has staggered at the promises of God, when ministers and workers have failed to present Jesus in His relation to the law of God. How often should they have assured the people that \"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\" (Romans 8:32).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 384}
