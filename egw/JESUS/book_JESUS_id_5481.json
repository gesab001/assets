{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     We may expect great things of God. It is not as though we were making the sacrifice for men, and Jesus was reluctant to save. The cross of Calvary expresses his estimate of the worth of the soul, and his love for the fallen race. He is bending over the purchase of his blood, asking with inexpressible tenderness, pity, and love, \\93Wilt thou be made whole?\\94 He invites, \\93Come unto me, and be ye saved. I have borne thy iniquities; by the stripes laid on me, thou mayest be healed.\\94 He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask than parents are to give good gifts to their children. But we must yield ourselves wholly to him. \n363\nHe cannot reveal himself to us as a sin-pardoning Saviour until we feel that without him we are hopelessly lost, that to live in sin, is misery, despair, and death.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 362}
