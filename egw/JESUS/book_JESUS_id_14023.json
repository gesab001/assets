{"word": "Power of Example. \n\n     In the epistle of Paul to Titus 2:13, 14, we read, \"Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\" This great work is to be performed for those only who are willing to be purified, willing to be peculiar, and who manifest a zeal in good works. How many shrink from the purifying process! They are unwilling to live out the truth, unwilling to appear singular in the eyes of the world. It is this mingling with the world which destroys our spirituality, pureness, and zeal. Satan's power is constantly exercised to stupefy the sensibility of God's people, that their consciences may not be sensitive to wrong, and that the sign of distinction between them and the world may be destroyed.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "4bSG", "page": 65}
