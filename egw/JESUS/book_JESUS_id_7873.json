{"word": "The salvation that Christ made such a sacrifice to gain for man is that which is alone of value; for it is that which saves from sin. . . . Thus the law of God is not weakened by the gospel, but the power of sin is broken, and the scepter of mercy is extended to the penitent sinner. . . . God will never forget His people in their struggle against evil. Let Jesus be our theme.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "Mar", "page": 326}
