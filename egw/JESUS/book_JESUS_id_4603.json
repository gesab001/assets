{"word": "When my eldest son was sixteen years old, he was stricken down in sickness. [MRS. WHITE'S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH SORROW IS PRESENTED HERE FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF ALL WHO MUST SUFFER THE LOSS OF DEAR ONES.-- COMPILERS.] His case was considered critical, and he called us to his bedside, and said, \"Father, Mother, it will be hard for you to part with your eldest son. If the Lord sees fit to spare my life, for your sake I will be pleased. If it is for my good and His name's glory for my life to close now, I will say, It is well with my soul. Father, go by yourself, and Mother, go by yourself; and pray. Then you will receive an answer according to the will of my Saviour, whom you love and I love.\" He was afraid that if we should bow together, our sympathies would strengthen, and we would ask for that which it would not be best for the Lord to grant. . . . We received no evidence that our son would recover. He died, putting his full trust in Jesus our Saviour. His death was a great blow to us, but it was a victory even in death; for his life was hid with Christ in God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 172}
