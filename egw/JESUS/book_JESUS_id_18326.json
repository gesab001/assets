{"word": "Certainty Born of Heart Conviction--Do not present the truth in a formal manner, but let the heart be vitalized by the Spirit of God, and let your words be spoken with such certainty that those who hear may know that the truth is a reality to you. Your manner may be educated, and your words may be of that character that they will voice the words of Peter: \"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty.\" With just as much assurance you may declare the message of God's truth. Those who believe sacred, eternal truth, must put their whole soul into their efforts. We must be stirred to the very heart as we behold the fulfilling of prophecy in the closing scenes of this earth's history. As our vision extends still further into the glories of eternity--the coming of Christ with power and great glory, and the scenes of the great day of judgment--we should not remain tame and unmoved. \"I saw the dead,\" John says, \"stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life: \n                                                                           227\nand the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.\"--Lt 8, 1895.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 226}
