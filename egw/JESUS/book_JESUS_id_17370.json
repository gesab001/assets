{"word": "Our work is incomplete if we do not educate others to be laborers together with God, visiting and praying with families, showing to the world what Jesus has done for us. God's Word declares, \"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world\" (James 1:27). These words are spoken to every follower of Christ. Not only the minister, but every soul connected with Him, is to be a worker in His vineyard. \"Herein is my Father glorified,\" Christ said, \"that ye bear much fruit\" (John 15:8). By His own life Christ has paid for your earnest, hearty cooperation. If you do not work as faithful missionaries, you are untrue to your trust, and you disappoint your Saviour. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 370}
