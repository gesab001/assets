{"word": "We may reach up to Jesus Christ who is our Advocate in the heavenly courts. We need a friend at court. We have been sinning, been disobedient, been transgressors, and it is of the highest consequence to us that we have a Friend at court to plead our cases to the Father. He says, \"If I be lifted up I will draw all men unto Me.\" Well, will all be drawn? Christ draws but will they respond to the drawing? Will they come? The invitation here in Revelation is this: \"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely\" (Revelation 22:17).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 223}
