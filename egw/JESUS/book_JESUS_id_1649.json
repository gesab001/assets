{"word": "The truly converted soul is illuminated from on high. . . . His words, his motives, his actions, may be misinterpreted and falsified; but he does not mind it because he has greater interests at stake. . . . He is not ambitious for display; he does not crave the praise of men. His hope is in heaven, and he keeps straight on, with his eye fixed on Jesus. He does right because it is right.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CC", "page": 365}
