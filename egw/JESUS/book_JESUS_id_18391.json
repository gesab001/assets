{"word": "Chap. 74 - Songs of the Redeemed\n\n     A Preview of Heaven--Then I was pointed to the glory of heaven, to the treasure laid up for the faithful. Everything was lovely and glorious. The angels would sing a lovely song, then they would cease singing and take their crowns from their heads and cast them glittering at the feet of the lovely Jesus, and with melodious voices cry, \"Glory, Alleluia!\" I joined with them in their songs of praise and honor to the Lamb, and every time I opened my mouth to praise Him, I felt an unutterable sense of the glory that surrounded me.--EW 66.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 463}
