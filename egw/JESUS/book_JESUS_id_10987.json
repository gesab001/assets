{"word": "While there may be in these societies much that appears to be good, there is, mingled with this, very much that makes the good of no effect, and renders these associations detrimental to the interests of the soul. We have \n                                                                           125\nanother life than that which is sustained by temporal food. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\" (Matthew 4:4). \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you\" (John 6:53). Jesus said, \"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life\" (John 6:54). Our bodies are built up from what we eat and drink. And as in the natural, so in the spiritual economy; it is that which our minds dwell upon which sustains the spiritual nature. Our Saviour said, \"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:63). Spiritual life must be sustained by communion with Christ through His Word. The mind must dwell upon it, the heart must be filled with it. The Word of God laid up in the heart and sacredly cherished and obeyed, through the power of the grace of Christ can make man right, and keep him right; but every human influence, every earthly invention, is powerless to give strength and wisdom to man. It cannot restrain passion, or correct deformity of character. Unless the truth of God controls the heart, the conscience will be warped. But in these worldly societies the mind is turned away from the Word of God. Men are not led to make it the study and the guide of life.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 124}
