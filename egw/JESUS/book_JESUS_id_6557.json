{"word": "Where many have erred, was in not being careful in following God's ideas, but their own. Christ Himself declared, \"The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do\" (John 5:19). So utterly was He emptied of Himself that He made no schemes and plans. He lived accepting God's plans for Him, and the Father day by day unfolded His plans. If Jesus was so wholly dependent, and declared, \"Whatsoever I see the Father do, that I do,\" how much more should human agents depend upon God for constant instruction, so that their lives might be the simple working out of God's plans! . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 147}
