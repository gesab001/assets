{"word": "There is great danger that students in the schools will fail of learning the all-important lesson which our Master would have them taught. This lesson is conveyed to us in the following scripture: \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" Some have not only failed to learn to bear the yoke of the meek and lowly Jesus, but have been unable to stand against the temptations which have surrounded them. Inexperienced youth who have journeyed long distances to obtain the advantages of an education at our school, have lost their hold upon Jesus. These things ought not so to be. \n                                                                           341", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 340}
