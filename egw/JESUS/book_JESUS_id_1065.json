{"word": "The reason that many professed Christians do not have a clear, well-defined experience, is that they do not think it is their privilege to understand what God has spoken through his word. After the resurrection of Jesus, two of his disciples were journeying toward Emmaus, and Jesus joined them. But they did not recognize their Lord, and thought he was some stranger, although \"beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? . . . Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.\" [Luke 24:27-32, 45.] \n                                                                           88\nThis is the work that we may look to Christ to do for us; for what the Lord has revealed, is for us and our children forever.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CE", "page": 87}
