{"word": "How to Be Overcomers.--We must meet all obstacles placed in our way and overcome them one at a time. \n\n554 \n\nIf we overcome the first difficulty, we shall be stronger to meet the next, and at every effort will become better able to make advancement. By looking to Jesus we may be overcomers. It is by fastening our eyes on the difficulties and shrinking from earnest battle for the right that we become weak and faithless.--YI, Jan 5, 1893.
