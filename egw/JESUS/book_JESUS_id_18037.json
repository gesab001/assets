{"word": "Jesus said, \"He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" Now if you are following another leader than Christ, who is Light and Truth and Life, leave that leader and follow Jesus the Light of the world. Is the Lord pleased to have you tossed about as the restless waves of the sea? No! No! I tell you He bids you be strengthened, stablished, rooted and grounded and built up in the most holy faith. Ye are not your own; ye are bought with a price which cannot be estimated. Then your owner is God, the mighty God, and for the price paid look to the cross of Calvary. This fluctuating between hope and fear grieves the heart of Christ, who hath given you unmistakable evidence of His love and hath chosen you.--Letter 41, May 16, 1893, to D. A. Corkham, a member of the Nova Scotia Conference committee.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 150}
