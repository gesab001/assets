{"word": "God has released us from burdens; He has set us free. . . . Our enemies may triumph. They may speak lying words, and their slandering tongue frame slander, deceit, guile; yet will we not be moved. We know in whom we believe. We have not run in vain, neither labored in vain. Jesus knows us. . . . A reckoning day is coming and all will be judged according to the deeds that are done in the body. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 351}
