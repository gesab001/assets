{"word": "As we follow on step by step to know the Lord, we need not expect that the way will be free from hindrances. Just as surely as we strive to serve the Lord, so surely will Satan put forth every effort in his power to accomplish our ruin. But help has been laid upon One that is mighty, and to every struggling child of His who asks Him for grace, believing, He comes with the needed aid.

In His strength, which we claim by faith, we are gaining the victory over sin.\\97Manuscript 27, 1886.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 364}
