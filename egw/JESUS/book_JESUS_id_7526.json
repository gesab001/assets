{"word": "The Lord Jesus has summoned the world to hear. \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\" Let all listen with submissive, reverent attention. He repeats the words given Him by the One who said, \"This is my beloved Son. . . . Hear ye him.\" Who is listening to the words which are light and life to all who receive them? Will men and women consider how God regards the creatures He has made? He formed man's mind. We do not think one noble thought that does not come from Him. He knows all the mysterious workings of the human mind, for did He not make it? God sees that sin has debased and degraded man, but He looks upon him with pity and compassion; for He sees that Satan has him in his power. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 253}
