{"word": "All who are made partakers of His salvation here, and who hope to share the glories of the kingdom hereafter, must gather with Christ. Each must feel that he is responsible for his own case. . . . If these maintain their Christian walk, Jesus will be in them the hope of glory, and they will love to speak forth His praise that they may be refreshed. The cause of their Master will be near and dear to them. . . . Every Christian must go on from strength to strength, and employ all his powers in the cause of God.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 301}
