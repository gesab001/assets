{"word": "Disciples of Christ to Represent His Character \n\n     The Saviour lived on this earth a life that love for God will constrain every true believer in Christ to live. Following His example, in our medical missionary work we shall reveal to the world that our credentials are from above, that as representatives of the kingdom of heaven we are fulfilling the words of the Lord's Prayer, \"Thy kingdom come.\" United with Christ in God, we shall reveal to the world that as God chose His Son to be His representative on the earth, even so has Christ chosen us to represent His character. Everyone who has genuine faith in Christ Jesus will represent Him in character. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 23}
