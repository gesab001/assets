{"word": "The Son of God declared in positive terms that the world was destitute of the knowledge of God; but this knowledge was of the highest value, and it was His own peculiar gift, the inestimable treasure which He brought into the world. In the exercise of His sovereign prerogative He imparted to His disciples the knowledge of the character of God, in order that they might communicate it to the world. . . . Everyone who believes the message of God should lift up Jesus, point men to Christ, and say, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" . . .", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 36}
