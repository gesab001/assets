{"word": "To Jesus in His agony on the cross there came one gleam of comfort. It was the prayer of the penitent thief. . . . In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging upon the cross, he sees the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world. Hope is mingled with anguish in his voice as the helpless, dying soul casts himself upon a dying Saviour. \"Lord, remember me,\" he cries, \"when thou comest into thy kingdom.\" Quickly the answer came. . . . Verily I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in paradise.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Mar", "page": 320}
