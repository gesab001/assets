{"word": "\"And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.\" Here Pilate again revealed his weakness, in submitting the sentence of Jesus to a lawless and infuriated mob. How true were the words of the prophet: \"Judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.\" The governor's cheek paled as he heard the terrible cry: \"Crucify him!\" He had not thought it would come to that--a man whom he had repeatedly pronounced innocent, to be consigned to the most dreaded of deaths. He now saw what a terrible thing he had done in placing the life of a just man in the balance against the decision of those, who, from envy and malice, had delivered him up to trial. Pilate had taken step after step in the violation of his conscience, and in excusing himself from judging with equity and fairness, as his position demanded he should do, until now he found himself almost helpless in the hands of the Jews.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 142}
