{"word": "Here is your danger, in failing to press forward \"toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\" Has the Lord given you light? Then you are responsible for that light; not merely while its rays are shining upon you, but for all which it has revealed to you in the past. You are to surrender your will to God daily; you are to walk in the light, and to expect more; for the light from the dear Saviour is to shine forth in clearer, more distinct rays amid the moral darkness, increasing in brightness more and more unto the perfect day.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 486}
