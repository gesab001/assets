{"word": "Testimonies\n \n\n     The testimony meeting may be considered the most precious of all meetings.--What deep and grave importance is attached to these little assemblies! Jesus Christ has paid the ransom money of His own blood for their souls, and He is in the midst of them when they meet to worship God. The Majesty of heaven identifies His interests with those of the believers, however humble may be their circumstances. And wherever they are privileged to meet together, it is appropriate that they speak often one to another, giving utterance to the gratitude and love that results from thinking upon the name of the Lord. Thus shall God be glorified as He hearkens and\n185\nhears, and the testimony meeting will be considered the most precious of all meetings.--OHC 168", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 184}
