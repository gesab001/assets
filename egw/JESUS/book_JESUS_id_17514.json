{"word": "The prayer for daily bread includes not only food to sustain the body, but that spiritual bread which will nourish the soul unto life everlasting. Jesus bids us, \\93Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life\\94 (John 6:27). He says, \\93I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever\\94 (verse 51). Our Savior is the Bread of Life, and it is by beholding His love, by receiving it into the soul, that we feed upon the bread which came down from heaven.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 11}
