{"word": "In the issue of the contest, all Christendom will be divided into two great classes,\\97those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast and his image and receive his mark. Although church and State will unite their power to compel \\93all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\\94 to receive \\93the mark of the beast,\\94 [Revelation 13:16.] yet the people of God will not receive it. The prophet of Patmos beholds \\93them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God,\\94 and singing the song of Moses and the Lamb.
