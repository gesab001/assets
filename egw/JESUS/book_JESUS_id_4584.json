{"word": "In the first chapter of Second Peter is presented the progressive work in the Christian life. The whole chapter is a lesson of deep importance. If man, in acquiring the Christian graces, works on the plan of addition, God has pledged Himself to work in his behalf upon the plan of multiplication. \"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.\" 2 Peter 1:2. The work is laid out before every soul that has acknowledged his faith in Jesus Christ by baptism.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 146}
