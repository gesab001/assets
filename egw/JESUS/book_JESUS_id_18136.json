{"word": "God would have every man look unto Jesus, who is the Author and the Finisher of our faith. As Christians, we must in words and actions exercise the noble traits of character that dwelt in Jesus Christ, as the very highest gift that can be conferred upon the soul of man. Will everyone who names the name of Christ depart from all iniquity? The word used here does not always mean the grosser forms of sin. It means every action we would not be pleased to meet in heaven. From all such actions we are to depart. We are not to practice them in this life, either in the family or in the church. All who enter heaven where Jesus is will have in this life the characteristics that will make heaven here below. Blessed and beneficent are the rays of light from the Sun of Righteousness who is now pouring His enlightening, healing beams upon everyone who will open the windows of the soul heavenward.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 257}
