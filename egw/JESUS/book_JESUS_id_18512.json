{"word": "Jesus opened His public mission with fervent prayer, and His example makes manifest the fact that prayer is necessary in order to lead a successful Christian life. He was constantly in communion with His Father, and His life presents to us a perfect pattern which we are to imitate. He appreciated the privilege of prayer, and His work showed the results of communion with God. Examining the record of His life, we find that upon all important occasions He retired to the grove, or to the solitude of the mountains, and offered earnest, persevering prayer to God. He frequently devoted the entire night to prayer just before He was called upon to work some mighty miracle. During these nightly seasons of prayer, after the labors of the day, He compassionately dismissed His disciples, that they might return to their homes for rest and sleep, while with strong crying and tears He poured forth earnest petitions to God in behalf of humanity.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 14}
