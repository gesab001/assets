{"word": "Jesus pointed His hearers to the birds as they warbled their carols of praise, unencumbered with thoughts of care, for \"they sow not, neither do they reap\"; and yet the great Father provides for their needs. And He asks, \"Are not ye of much more value than they?\" \n          \"No sparrow falls without His care, \n              No soul bows low but Jesus knows; \n           For He is with us everywhere, \n              And marks each bitter tear that flows. \n           And He will never, never, never \n              Forsake the soul that trusts Him ever.\" . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 73}
