{"word": "A Precious Experience\nHe who takes up the work of canvassing as he should must be both an educator and a student.\n85\nWhile he tries to teach others he himself must learn to do the work of an evangelist. As canvassers go forth into the field with humble hearts, full of earnest activity, they will find many opportunities to speak a word in season to souls ready to die in discouragement. After laboring for these needy ones they will be able to say: \\93Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.\\94 Ephesians 5:8. As they see the sinful course of others they can say: \\93Such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\\94 1 Corinthians 6:11.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CEv", "page": 84}
