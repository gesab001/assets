{"word": "The Young Minister \n\n     Young men are to enter the ministry as co-workers with Jesus, sharing His life of self-denial and sacrifice, voicing the words of the Master, \"I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified.\" [John 17:19.] If they will yield themselves to God, He will use them in helping to carry out His plan for the salvation of souls. Let the young man who has entered the ministry look his calling fairly in the face, and determine to devote his time, his strength, his influence, to the work, well aware of the conditions under which he serves the Redeemer.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW", "page": 104}
