It taught them to deal with the transgressor with patience, sympathy, and forgiving love. During the time in which Peter denied his Lord, the love which Jesus bore him never faltered.

Remembering his own weakness and failure, Peter was to deal with his flock as tenderly as Christ had dealt with him.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 232}
