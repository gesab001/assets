{"word": "Chap. 13 - The Manifest Working of the Holy Spirit at Battle Creek College.\n-\n\n     \"Then Jesus said unto them, yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.\" Some men in the Battle Creek College have a false idea as to what constitutes duty. The Lord God of heaven has caused his Holy Spirit from time to time to move upon the students in the school, that they might acknowledge him in all their ways, so that he might direct their paths. At times the manifestation of the Holy Spirit has been so decided that studies were forgotten, and the greatest Teacher the world ever knew made his voice heard, saying, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of \n                                                                           78\nme; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls: for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" The Lord knocked at the door of hearts, and I saw that angels of God were present. There seemed to be no special effort on the part of the teachers to influence the students to give their attention to the things of God, but God had a Watcher in the school, and though his presence was unseen, yet his influence was discernible. Again and again there have been manifest tokens of the presence of the holy Watchman in the school. Again and again the voice of Jesus has spoken to the students, saying, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 77}
