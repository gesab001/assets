{"word": "Divine sonship is not something that we gain of ourselves. Only to those who receive Christ as their Saviour is given the power to become sons and daughters of God. The sinner cannot, by any power of his own, rid himself of sin. . . . But the promise of sonship is made to all who believe on His name.\" Every one who comes to Jesus in faith will receive pardon.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 53}
