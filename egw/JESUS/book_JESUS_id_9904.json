{"word": "OUR VOICES REACH GOD\\92S EAR.\\97The word that was spoken to Jesus at the Jordan, \\93This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,\\94 embraces humanity. God spoke to Jesus as our representative. With all our sins and weaknesses, we are not cast aside as worthless. \\93He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.\\94 Ephesians 1:6. The glory that rested upon Christ is a pledge of the love of God for us. It tells us of the power of prayer,\\97how the human voice may reach the ear of God, and our petitions find acceptance in the courts of heaven. By sin, earth was cut off from heaven, and alienated from its communion; but Jesus has connected it again with the sphere of glory. His love has encircled man, and reached the highest heaven. The light which fell from the open portals upon the head of our Saviour will fall upon us as we pray for help to resist temptation. The voice which spoke to Jesus says to every\n87\nbelieving soul, This is My beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.\\97(The Desire of Ages, 113.)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 86}
