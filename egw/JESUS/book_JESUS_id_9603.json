{"word": "Jesus says, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.\" Will we let Him in? He would not have us stand at this time, amid the perils of the last days, in our own finite strength.... It is our privilege to walk in the sunshine of His presence, and to weave into the characters we are forming the golden threads of cheerfulness, gratitude, forbearance, and love. We may thus show the power of divine grace, and reflect light from Heaven amid all the frets and irritations that come to us day by day. . . . Then why do we go stumbling along without light?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 352}
