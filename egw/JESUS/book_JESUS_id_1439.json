Oh, can we not remember that here is a world to labor for? Shall we not move forward step by step, letting God use us as His helping hand? Shall we not place ourselves on the altar of service? Then the love of Christ will touch and transform us, make us willing for His sake to do and dare.--Review and Herald, Jan. 27, 1903.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CM", "page": 18}
