{"word": "Jesus is your best Friend. Live by daily faith on the Son of God. Let your course of action be such that God can approve. Then you will be a blessing to others. . . . Do not outgrow the simple faith and trust of your childhood. When sick, your first request was, \"Father, Mother, pray that the Lord will heal me and forgive my sins.\" When prayer was offered in your behalf, you made your simple prayer and thanked the Lord He had heard and answered, and with perfect faith and confidence you said, \"I shall get well. The Lord has blessed me.\" You slept in perfect peace, in confidence that holy angels would guard your bed.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 310}
