{"word": "We are living in perilous times. In the fear of God I tell you that the true exposition of the Scriptures is necessary for the correct moral development of our characters. When mind and heart are controlled by the Holy Spirit, when self is dead, the truth is capable of constant expansion and development. When the truth as it is in Jesus molds our characters, it will be seen to be truth indeed. As it is contemplated by the believer, it will grow brighter, shining with its original beauty. It will increase in value, quickening and vivifying the mind. . . . It will elevate our aspirations, enabling us to reach the perfect standard of holiness.-- Review and Herald, Feb. 14, 1899.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 111}
