{"word": "Many are so absorbed in their worldly cares and perplexities that they have little time to pray, and feel but little interest in prayer. They may observe the form of worship, but the spirit of true supplication is lacking. Such have departed widely from the Pattern. Jesus our example was much in prayer; and oh, how earnest, how fervent were His petitions!
