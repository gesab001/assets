{"word": "Those who act a part in the work of God do good only because God is behind them, doing the work. Shall we then praise men, and give thanks to man, neglecting to recognize God? If we do, God will not cooperate with us. When man puts himself first and God second, he shows that he is losing his wisdom and righteousness. All that is ever done toward restoring the moral image of God in man is done because God is the efficiency of the worker. Christ declares in His prayer to His Father, \"This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\" (John 17:3).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 81}
