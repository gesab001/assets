{"word": "A Caution to Evangelists and Pastors.--Our ministering brethren make a decided failure of doing their work in a manner directed by the Lord. They fail to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. They have not gained an experience through personal communion with God, or a true knowledge of what constitutes Christian character; therefore many are baptized who have no fitness for this sacred ordinance, but who are knit to self and the world. They have not seen Christ or received Him by faith.--Review and Herald, Feb. 4, 1890.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 319}
