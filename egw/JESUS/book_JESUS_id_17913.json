{"word": "From the lips of the King of glory the benediction will fall upon their ears like richest music, \\93Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\\94 Thus the redeemed will be welcomed to the mansions that Jesus\n284\nis preparing for them. There their companions will not be the vile of earth, but those who through divine aid have formed perfect characters. Every sinful tendency, every imperfection, has been removed by the blood of Christ; and the excellence and brightness of His glory, far exceeding the brightness of the sun in its meridian splendor, is imparted to them. And the moral beauty, the perfection of His character, shines through them, in worth far exceeding this outward splendor. They are without fault before the great white throne, sharing the dignity and privileges of the angels.\\97The Watchman, March 31, 1908.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TA", "page": 283}
