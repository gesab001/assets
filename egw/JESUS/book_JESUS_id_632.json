{"word": "The whole probationary period is a time of test and trial, but by all who are obedient to Christ the words of the inspired John will be experienced: \\93As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\\94 The Lord Jesus came to strengthen every earnest seeker for truth, to reveal the Father. He allowed nothing to divert His mind from the great work of restoring to men and women the moral image of God. And every human agent must see that the great and important work for them in this life is to receive the divine likeness, to prepare a character for the future life. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 33}
