{"word": "\"I say to the family and friends, I am a mourner with you today; but there is something about a righteous life in Christ which robs death of its terrors, and the grave of all its woe. Jesus has been there, and we may safely walk the path which Jesus trod. So, brethren, let us look up. Let us look beyond this present vale of tears and sorrow to a brighter and an eternal hope and life, for Jesus' sake, amen.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 455}
