{"word": "The mission of Jesus was demonstrated by convincing miracles. His doctrine astonished the people. . . . It was a system of truth that met the wants of the heart. His teaching was plain, clear, and comprehensive. The practical truths He uttered had a convincing power, and arrested the attention of the people. Multitudes lingered at His side, marveling at His wisdom. His manner corresponded with the great truths He proclaimed. There was no apology, no hesitancy, not the shadow of a doubt or uncertainty that it might be other than He declared. He spoke of the earthly and the heavenly, of the human and the divine, with positive authority; and the people \"were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.\" . . .", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 101}
