{"word": "At this time--a time of overwhelming iniquity-- a new life, coming from the Source of all life, is to take possession of those who have the love of God in their hearts, and they are to go forth to proclaim with power the message of a crucified and risen Saviour. They are to put forth earnest, untiring efforts to save souls. Their example is to be such that it will have a telling influence for good on those around them. They are to count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "9T", "page": 44}
