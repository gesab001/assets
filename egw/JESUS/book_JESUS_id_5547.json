{"word": "It was \\93while we were yet sinners,\\94 that \\93Christ died for us.\\94 [Romans 5:8.] In view of his unmerited love and mercy toward us, how can we cherish malice, or even one feeling of unkindness toward our brethren, the purchase of his blood? Let us put away all suspicion and hatred, and all feelings of bitterness, even toward our worst enemies, those who seek to do us harm. But, brethren, do not wait till the heart is in harmony with your brother before you come to Jesus; for it is his Spirit and power working in you that will give you the victory.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 430}
