{"word": "The Lord Jesus would have men trade upon their talents, and Jesus has promised that he will give grace for grace. As we impart to others, we shall receive more richly. And as we thus labor, the mind will not become clogged with a mass of matter which has been crowded into it with no opportunity to impart what has been received. The student becomes a mental dyspeptic by being crammed with much that he cannot use. Much time has been wasted, and the progressive usefulness of students hindered, by the teaching of that which cannot be utilized by the Spirit of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 111}
