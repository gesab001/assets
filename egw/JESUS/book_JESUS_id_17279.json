{"word": "Patient, pitying tenderness is to be exercised toward the erring, to bring back the wandering sheep. We have an example of this in Christ's treatment of Peter who denied his Lord with cursing and swearing. Peter thought himself strong. He said, \"Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake\" (John 13:37). But Jesus answered him, \"Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice\" (Mark 14:30). But Peter \"spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise\" (verse 31).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 260}
