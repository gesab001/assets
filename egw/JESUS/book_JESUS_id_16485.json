{"word": "Do not cheapen the work of God. Let it stand forth as from God. Let it bear no human impress, but the impress of the divine. \n15\nSelf is to be lost sight of in Jesus. It is not safe to allow your own ideas and judgment, your set ways, your peculiar traits of character, to be a controlling power. There is a great need of breadth in your calculations in order to place the work high in all your plans, proportionate to its importance.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 14}
