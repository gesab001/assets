This he directed me to place next my heart, and when I wished to see Jesus, take it from my bosom, and stretch it to the utmost.

I placed the cord near my heart, and joyfully descended the narrow stairs, praising the Lord, and telling all whom I met where they could find Jesus.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 27}
