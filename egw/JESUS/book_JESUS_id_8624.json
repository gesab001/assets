{"word": "Like the patriarchs of old, those who profess to love God should erect an altar to Him wherever they pitch their tent. . . . Let the father, as priest of the household, lay upon the altar of God the morning and evening sacrifice, while the wife and children unite in prayer and praise. In such a household Jesus will love to abide.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 33}
