{"word": "The period of life in every case is beset with temptations, and it is through faith in Jesus Christ alone that we shall find grace to help in every time of need. But each worker has a life to live, a character to form. Each period of life brings with the passing years some special opportunities for work; and each advancing year must be made use of, improved to the very best of human capability. This, with the aid of divine agencies, will show improvement, advancement onward and upward, walking step by step in a safe path heavenward.--Manuscript 28, Oct. 4, 1896, to \"Those Concerned in Publishing Mount of Blessing.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 286}
