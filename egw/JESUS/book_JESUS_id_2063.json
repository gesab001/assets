{"word": "Love a Subduing Power \n\n     Consecrate yourself and your all to the service of Him who hath loved you, and hath given Himself for you. Jesus says, \"Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples.\" This means in the Sabbath school work as much as in the work of the minister. Now is the golden opportunity to sow precious seed that will spring up and bear fruit unto eternal life. Now you may be a savor of life unto life; for when you can impart to others truth that you have gained through a deep experience, it has a life-giving power that will impress hearts and draw them to Jesus. When Jesus is drawing, and His colaborers are working in harmony with Him, hard indeed must be the heart that will not be impressed and subdued by the power of divine love. --TSS 69, 70.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 181}
