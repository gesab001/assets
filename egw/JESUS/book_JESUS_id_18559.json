{"word": "When the sinner sees his Saviour dying upon the cross under the curse of sin in his stead, beholding His pardoning love, love awakes in his heart. The sinner loves Christ, because Christ has first loved him, and love is the fulfilling of the law. The repenting soul realizes that God \"is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9). The Spirit of God works in the believer's soul, enabling him to advance from one line of obedience to another, reaching on from strength to greater strength, from grace to grace in Christ Jesus.--Review and Herald, Nov. 1, 1892.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 60}
