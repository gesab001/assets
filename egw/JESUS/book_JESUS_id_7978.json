{"word": "Nurses and physicians, think of Jesus. How careful He was of the remnants of food left after feeding the five thousand! By His thoughtful care He would teach us order and economy. The great work of redemption weighed constantly upon His soul. As He was teaching and healing, all the energies of body and soul were taxed to the utmost, yet He noticed the most simple things in human life and in nature. His most instructive lessons were those in which He illustrated the kingdom of God by the simple things of nature. He did not overlook the needs of the humblest of His servants. His ear heard every needy cry. He was awake to the touch of the afflicted woman in the crowd.
