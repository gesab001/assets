{"word": "This work has been neglected. Is it any marvel that God does not visit the churches with greater manifestations of his power, when so large a number are shut in to themselves, engrossed in their own interests? It is thus that their piety becomes tame and weak, and they grow bigoted and self-caring. It is in working for others that they will keep their own souls alive. If they will become co-laborers with Jesus, we shall see the light in our churches steadily burning brighter and brighter, sending forth its rays to penetrate the darkness beyond their own borders.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 291}
