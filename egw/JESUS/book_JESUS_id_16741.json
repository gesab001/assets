{"word": "The strong denunciation of the Pharisees against Jesus was, \"Thou, being a man, makest thyself God\" (John 10:33), and for this reason they sought to stone Him. Christ did not apologize for this supposed assumption on His part. He did not say to His accusers, \"You misunderstand me; I am not God.\" He was manifesting God in humanity. Yet He was the humblest of all the prophets, and He exemplified in His life the truth that the more perfect the character of human beings, the more simple and humble they will be. He has given to men a pattern of what they may be in their humanity, through becoming partakers of the divine nature. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 111}
