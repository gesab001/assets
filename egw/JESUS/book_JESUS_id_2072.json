{"word": "This is nothing more than Jesus expects of His followers. No individual who has before him so great an object as the salvation of souls will be at a loss to devise ways and means for denying self. This will be an individual work. All that it is in our power to bestow will flow into the Lord's treasury, to be used for the proclamation of truth, that the message of Christ's soon coming and the claims of His law may be sounded to all parts of the world. Missionaries must be sent out to do this work.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CS", "page": 55}
