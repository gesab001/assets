After he had fallen and been converted, Jesus said to him, \"Feed my lambs.\" Before Peter's feet slipped, he had not the spirit of meekness required to feed the lambs; but after he became sensible of his own weakness, he knew just how to teach the erring and fallen; he could come close to their side in tender sympathy, and could help them (HS 121).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1151}
