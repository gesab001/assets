{"word": "Yet this apostasy, widespread as it has come to be, is not universal. Not all in the world are lawless and sinful; not all have taken sides with the enemy. God has many . . . who are hoping against hope that Jesus will come soon to end the reign of sin and death. . . . These need the personal help of those who have learned to know God and the power of His word. . . . As those who have an understanding of Bible truth try to seek out the men and women who are longing for light, angels of God will attend them. . . . Many will cease to pay homage to man-made institutions and will take their stand fearlessly on the side of God and His law.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CC", "page": 215}
