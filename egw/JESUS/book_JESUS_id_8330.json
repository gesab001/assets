{"word": "Perfect Harmony Between Law and Gospel.--There is perfect harmony between the law of God and the gospel of Jesus Christ. \"I and My Father are one,\" says the Great Teacher. The gospel of Christ is the Good News of grace, or favor, by which man may be released from the condemnation of sin and enabled to render obedience to the law of God. The gospel points to the moral code as a rule of life. That law, by its demands for undeviating obedience, is continually pointing the sinner to the gospel for pardon and peace.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 563}
