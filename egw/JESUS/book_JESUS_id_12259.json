{"word": "If we are not better men and women, if we are not more kindhearted, more pitiful, more courteous, more full of tenderness and love; if we do not manifest to others the love that led Jesus to the world on His mission of mercy, we are not witnesses to the world of the power of Jesus Christ. Jesus lived not to please Himself. . . . He came to elevate, to ennoble, to make happy all with whom He came in contact. . . . He never did a rude action, never spoke a discourteous word.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 319}
