{"word": "This yoke, [which] you are afraid [to] put upon your neck because you fear it will gall, Jesus says is easy. The burden you dare not touch--it is light. All that is required on your part is to resolutely lay hold upon it, and you will find it a support rather than a grievous burden. That cross which seems to you so inconvenient an instrument to lift, which seems too heavy to be raised, when you cheerfully lay hold upon it and lift it, it will lift you and be a support and strength to you. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 376}
