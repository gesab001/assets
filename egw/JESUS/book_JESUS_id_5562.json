{"word": "Church membership will not guarantee us heaven. We must abide in Christ, and his love must abide in us. We must every day make advancement in the formation of symmetrical character. \\93Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven \n447\nis perfect.\\94 [Matthew 5:48.] As God is perfect in his sphere, so are we required to be perfect in ours. There is a great work before us individually, to reach this high standard. Our attainments will be just in accordance with the effort we make, our character just what we choose to make it; for through the divine aid promised us, we can overcome. Jesus \\93knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.\\94 [Psalm 103:14.] In pitying tenderness he will give us the help and strength we need.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 446}
