But he had declared that he would not be satisfied without the evidence of feeling added to sight, and Jesus gave him the evidence which he had desired. Thomas cried out, \"My Lord and my God!\" But Jesus reproved him for his unbelief, saying, \"Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed: blessed\n237\nare they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\" John 20:28, 29.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 236}
