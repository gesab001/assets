{"word": "Overseers to Avoid Severity.--Less long, sweeping journeys across the continent, and more close investigation of the true inward working of the heart, are essential. The rooms in the office need inspection, that the things you know not, you may discern and search out. The temple of God must be cleansed, that His name shall not be dishonored by men who are not connected with Him. My heart is pained as, in my dreams, I am visited and appealed to by different ones placing the corruptions in the office of publication before me. I awaken to find it a dream, but know it to be the truth. My dear brother, the spirit of severity, of lording it over the ignorant and helpless, is being opened before me. In the place of the office being an educating school to prepare the youth to give their hearts to the Lord, the teachers and overseers, by their course of action, drive them onto Satan's battleground. It is not a place where the Lord Jesus is entertained as a heavenly Guest. Some of the overseers, and the workers under their supervision, give little time to thoughts of a high and holy order; the Lord is not glorified.--Lt 86, 1896.
