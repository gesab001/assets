{"word": "Let labor for souls become a part of your life. Go to the homes of those even who manifest no interest. While mercy's sweet voice invites the sinner, work with every energy of heart and brain, as did Paul, who \\93ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.\\94 [Acts 20:31.] In the day of God, how many will confront us, and say \\93I am lost! I am lost! And you never warned me; you never entreated me to come to Jesus. Had I believed as you did, I would have followed every Judgment-bound soul within my reach with prayers and tears and warnings.\\94", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 453}
