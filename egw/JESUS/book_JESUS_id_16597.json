{"word": "I was shown that there is a much greater work before us than we as yet have any idea of, if we would insure health by placing ourselves in the right relation to life. Dr. A. has been doing a great and good work in the treatment of disease, and in enlightening those who have all their lives been in ignorance in regard to the relation that eating, drinking, and working sustain to health. God in His mercy has given His people light through His humble instrument, that in order to overcome disease they must deny a depraved appetite, and practice temperance in all things. He has caused great light to shine upon their pathway. Shall those who are \"looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us, that He might \n\n188 \n\nredeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works,\" be behind the religionists of the day who have no faith in the soon appearing of our Saviour? The peculiar people whom He is purifying unto Himself, to be translated to Heaven without seeing death, should not be behind others in good works. In their efforts to cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, they should be as far ahead of any other class of people on the earth, as their profession is more exalted than that of others.", "paragraph": 8, "bookcode": "TSDF", "page": 187}
