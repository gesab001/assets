{"word": "Jesus came to represent the character of God in living out the holy law of Jehovah. In every lesson He gave to His disciples and to the people He sought to define clearly its principles. By personal obedience to the law He invested the common duties of life with a holy significance. He lived a man among men. . . . He lived among the people, He shared their poverty and their griefs. He dignified life in all its details by keeping before men the glory of God, and by subordinating everything to the will of His Father. His life was characterized by supreme love to God, and fervent love to His fellow men. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 288}
