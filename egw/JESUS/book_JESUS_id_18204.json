{"word": "No one need despond who commits his soul to Jesus. We have an all-powerful Saviour. Looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of your faith, you can say, \"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof\" (Psalm 46:1-3). . . .", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 321}
