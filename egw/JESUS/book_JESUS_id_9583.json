{"word": "Nothing but a deep personal experience will enable us to stand the test of the trials and temptations we shall meet in the Christian warfare.

We may all conquer in His strength; but it will not answer for us to suppose that we can dispense with His help. He says, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" John 15:5.
