{"word": "We are Christ's representatives upon the earth. How do we fulfill our mission? Christ's representatives will be in daily communion with Him. Their words will be select, their speech seasoned with grace, their hearts filled with love, their efforts sincere, earnest, persevering, to save souls for whom Christ has died. Let all do their utmost to work for the salvation of the dear children and youth, and by and by they will listen with joy to the words of Jesus, \"Well done, good and faithful servant; . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" What is this joy? It is beholding the redeemed saints saved through their instrumentality, through the blood of Jesus Christ.--SSW July 1, 1885.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 88}
