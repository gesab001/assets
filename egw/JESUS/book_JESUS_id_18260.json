{"word": "Believe Jesus loves you, and in your efforts to obey the truth, if you err, don't feel that you must worry and worry, give up your confidence in God, think that God is your enemy. We are erring mortals. If we sin, \"we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous\" (1 John 2:1). You cannot cleanse yourself from impurities. Carry all your burdens to Jesus. He will help you. He wants you to not wait and expect through your good deeds to make atonement for sin or to make yourself righteous. Trust in the merits of the blood of a crucified, risen Saviour.--Letter 20, Dec. 28, 1867, to a discouraged church member.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 376}
