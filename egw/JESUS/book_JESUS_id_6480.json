{"word": "Listen to the words that He spoke as the weary mothers brought their children to Him to be blessed. The disciples, unwilling that their Master should be disturbed, were sending the women away, but Christ said, \"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God\" (Mark 10:14). And taking them in His arms, He blessed them. Could the future of these children be opened before us we could see the mothers recalling to the minds of the children the scene of that day and repeating the loving words of the Saviour. . . . This same Jesus is your Saviour.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 63}
