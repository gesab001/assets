{"word": "\"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (Romans 5:1). Justification means pardon. It means that the heart, purged from dead works, is prepared to receive the blessing of sanctification. God has told us what we must do to receive this blessing. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Do all things without murmuring and disputings; that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world\" (Philippians 2:12-15).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 96}
