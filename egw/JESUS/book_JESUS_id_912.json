{"word": "Like his Master, John patiently submitted to every attempt to put him to death. When his enemies cast him into the cauldron of boiling oil, they thought to hear no more from him. But as the words of satanic origin were spoken, \\93Thus perish all who believe in that deceiver, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,\\94 John declared, \\93My Master patiently submitted to all that Satan and his angels could devise to humiliate and torture Him. He gave His life to save the world. He died that we might live. I am honored in being permitted to suffer for His sake. I am only a weak, sinful man, but Christ was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners. He did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth.\\94 John\\92s words, while suffering at the hands of his enemies, had an influence, and he was removed from the cauldron by the very ones who had cast him in.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 312}
