{"word": "Literature Evangelists Not Necessarily Preachers.-- Canvassers are needed to take up the work of carrying these silent messengers of truth to the people--canvassers who feel a burden for souls, and who can speak words in season to those who are seeking for light. Some may say, \"I am not a minister; I cannot preach to the people.\" You may not be able to preach, but you can be an evangelist, ministering to the needs of those with whom you come in contact; you can be God's helping hand, working as the disciples worked; you can ask those you meet if they love the Lord Jesus.--ChS 147.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 306}
