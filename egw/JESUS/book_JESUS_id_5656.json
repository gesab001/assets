{"word": "The result of the work of Jesus, as He sat, weary and hungry, at the well, was wide-spread in blessing. The one soul whom He sought to help became a means of reaching others and bringing them to the Saviour. This is ever the way that the work of God has made progress on the earth. Let your light shine, and other lights will be kindled.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW", "page": 195}
