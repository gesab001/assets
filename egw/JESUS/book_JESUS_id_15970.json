{"word": "The Lord is soon to come, and we must be prepared to meet Him in peace. Let us be determined to do all in our power to impart light to those around us. We are not to be sad, but cheerful, and we are to keep the Lord Jesus ever before us. He is soon coming, and we must be ready and waiting for His appearing. Oh, how glorious it will be to see Him and be welcomed as His redeemed ones! Long have we waited, but our hope is not to grow dim. If we can but see the King in His beauty we shall be forever blessed. I feel as if I must cry aloud: \"Homeward bound!\" We are nearing the time when Christ will come in power and great glory to take His ransomed ones to their eternal home. \n\n                                               -", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "8T", "page": 253}
