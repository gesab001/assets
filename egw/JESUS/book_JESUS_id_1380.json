{"word": "There Should Be No Thought of Failure \n\n     Workers for Christ are never to think, much less to speak, of failure in their work. The Lord Jesus is our efficiency in all things; His Spirit is to be our inspiration; and as we place ourselves in His hands, to be channels of light, our means of doing good will never be exhausted. We may draw upon His fulness, and receive of that grace which has no limit.--Gospel Workers, p. 19.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 261}
