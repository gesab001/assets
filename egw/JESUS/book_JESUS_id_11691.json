{"word": "Chapter 2 \n\n     1 (Romans 8:34; 1 Timothy 2:5; Hebrews 2:18;  7:25; Hebrews 9:24; see EGW on John 17:5, 24). Fenced From Satan's Attacks.--\"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.\" How careful is the Lord Jesus to give no occasion for a soul to despair. How He fences about the soul from Satan's fierce attacks. If through manifold temptations we are surprised or deceived into sin, He does not turn from us and leave us to perish. No, no, that is not our Saviour. Christ prayed for us. He was tempted in all points like as we are; and having been tempted, He knows how to succor those who are tempted.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 948}
