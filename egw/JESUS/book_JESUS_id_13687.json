{"word": "Transported with joy, he beholds the trees that were once his delight,--the very trees from which he plucked fruit when he rejoiced in the perfection of innocence and holiness. He sees the vines that his own hands have trained, the very flowers that he once loved to care for. His mind grasps the reality of the scene; he comprehends that this is indeed Eden restored, far more beautiful now than when he was banished from it. The Saviour leads him to the tree of life, and plucks the glorious fruit, and bids him eat. He looks about him, and beholds a multitude of his family redeemed, standing in the Paradise of God. Then he casts his glittering crown at the feet of Jesus, and, falling upon his breast, embraces the Redeemer. He touches the golden harp, and the vaults of Heaven echo the triumphant song, \"Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and lives again!\" The family of Adam take up the strain, and cast their crowns at the Saviour's feet as they bow before him in adoration.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 466}
