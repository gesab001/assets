{"word": "Were it not for the power received through Christ we would have no strength. But Christ has all power. \"Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, . . . and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Here is our power, our comfort. Of ourselves we have no strength. But He says, \"I am with you alway,\" helping you to perform your duty, guiding, comforting, sanctifying, and sustaining you, giving you success in speaking words that will draw the attention of others to Christ and awaken in their minds the desire to understand the hope and meaning of the truth, turning them from darkness to light. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 188}
