{"word": "When you find yourself depressed, and you have a sinking time, pray. Hold on by prayer to that arm that was stretched out to hold up a sinking Peter. It will give you courage, vital energy, and pure, unadulterated wisdom. Our people generally are to understand from whence their strength comes. Our reinforcements come from God. In your weakness, lay hold of infinite strength, and the people will see that you have the solid rock of God's promises beneath your feet. Your heart must turn away from human supports. If your heart goes out to Jesus in living trust, you will be strong. You will say, Brethren, have courage in the Lord. But if the people see that you have a hesitance to venture out and take responsibilities, they will think, Well, he is weak, and  cannot advise and counsel us.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 68}
