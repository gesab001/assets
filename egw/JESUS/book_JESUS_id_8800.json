{"word": "Death seemed very near; but I felt that I could cling, with the firm grasp of faith, to the hand of Jesus. He who holds the waters in the hollow of His hand could keep us in the tempest. The waves of the great deep obey His voice, \"Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.\" I thought how Jesus calmed the fears of His disciples as He stilled the stormy Galilee; and should I be afraid to trust to His protection who had given me my work? My heart was kept in perfect peace because it was stayed on Him. The lesson of trust I learned during these few hours was very precious. I have found that every trial of life is given to teach me a new lesson of my own dependence, and of trust in my heavenly Father. We may believe that God is with us in every place, and in every trying hour we may hold fast that hand which has all power. \n                                                                           337", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 336}
