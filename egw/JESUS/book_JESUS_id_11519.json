{"word": "22 (ch. 5:40; Luke 12:48). No Provision for Willful Blindness.--[John 15:22 quoted.]. . . Those who have an opportunity to hear the truth, and yet take no pains to hear or understand it, thinking that if they do not hear, they will not be accountable, will be judged guilty before God the same as if they had heard and rejected. There will be no excuse for those who choose to go in error when they might understand what is truth. In His sufferings and death Jesus has made atonement for all sins of ignorance, but there is no provision made for willful blindness. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1145}
