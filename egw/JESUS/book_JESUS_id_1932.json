{"word": "Direct the Mind to Jesus \n\n     The physician should never lead his patients to fix their attention on him. He is to teach them to grasp with the hand of faith the outstretched hand of the Saviour. \n                                                                           353\nThen the mind will be illuminated with the light radiating from the Sun of Righteousness. What physicians attempt to do, Christ did in deed and in truth. They try to save life; He is life itself.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 352}
