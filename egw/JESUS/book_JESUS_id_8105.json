{"word": "The students in our schools are to regard the knowledge of God as above everything else. Only by searching the Scriptures can this knowledge be attained. \"The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. . . . The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. . . . But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\" --The Youth's Instructor, Nov. 24, 1903.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 191}
