He does this, not to urge us to do impossible things, but because He knows what it means to keep His Father\\92s commandments. He wants every soul that heareth His invitation to say the same to others, and to receive His richest gifts, for He knows that in keeping the commandments of God, we are not brought into servile bondage, but are made free through the blood of Jesus Christ. \\93And in keeping of them [His commandments] there is great reward\\94 (Psalm 19:11).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 259}
