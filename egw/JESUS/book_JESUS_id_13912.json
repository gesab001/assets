{"word": "We learned from one who had heard the document read in Boston and Roxbury, that H. had gone to Carver to read it there. At first I felt distressed. I could not see why God should suffer me thus to be reproached. I had to suffer anguish of spirit for others, and now my character was attacked. For a short time I sunk in discouragement. But as I went before the Lord with this severe trial, he gave me grace to bear it. His strong arm supported me. I was not suffering as an evil-doer, but for Christ's sake, and how many had suffered the same before me, even Jesus, the Saviour of the world, was reproached and falsely accused, and these words seemed ever before me, \"Are ye able to drink of the cup?\" Can \"ye be baptized with the baptism?\" I felt, as I was bowed before the Lord, that I could say, Let me know the fellowship of Christ's sufferings. I knew what was reported as being in that document was false, and Jesus knew it, then why should I be troubled? I fully believed that Jesus was soon to come, and then my name, which was handled so maliciously here, would be justified. I there consecrated myself, my name and all, to God, and with reconciliation could say, Only let my poor name be written in the Lamb's book of life, \n                                                                           71\nand men may handle it just as God suffers them. Let me suffer with Christ that I may reign with him.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 70}
