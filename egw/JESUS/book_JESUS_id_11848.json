{"word": "As I saw what we must be to inherit glory, and then saw how much Jesus had suffered for us to obtain for us so rich an inheritance, I prayed that we might be baptized into Christ's sufferings, that we might not shrink at trials, but bear them with patience and joy, knowing what Jesus had suffered, that we might through his poverty and sufferings be made rich. Said the angel, \\93Deny self, ye must step fast.\\94 I saw that some of us have had time to get the truth, and to advance step by step, and every step we have taken has given us strength to take the next. But now time is almost finished, and what we have been years learning, they will have to learn in a few months. And they will have to unlearn much, and learn again. And those who will not receive the mark of the beast and his image, when the decree goes forth, must have decision now to say,  nay, we will not regard the institution of the beast.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ExV", "page": 55}
