{"word": "God desires to see the souls of His people in Africa mastered by heaven-born purposes. But what a work needs to be done there! The people have not learned of the great Teacher. Human nature, when unsubdued, unsanctified, and depraved, is a very curious and wonderful thing. It assumes a great many forms, because it is not worked by the Holy Spirit. But when the Lord Jesus is an abiding presence in the soul, none need to question the value of the human being, man or woman.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 94}
