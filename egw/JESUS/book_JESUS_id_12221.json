{"word": "The whole mind must be molded by the Holy Spirit. Divine power will combine with human effort, when we seek earnestly to be complete in Christ Jesus.

As the light of the sun sheds its warmth throughout all the world, so the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness will shed health-giving rays into the heart. \n                                                                           286", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 285}
