{"word": "It was a great sacrifice Christ made for man in dying for him upon the cross. What are we willing to sacrifice for His love? Jesus says, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments\" (John 14:15)--not to select out one or two or nine, but the whole ten--all His commandments must be kept. John tells us of those who pretend to love but do not obey God's requirements. \"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him\" (1 John 2:4). \"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous\" (chap. 5:3). . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 319}
