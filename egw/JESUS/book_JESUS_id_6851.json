{"word": "Rose, look well to your steps; listen to no promises, believe only the Word of God which will make you wise unto salvation. Trust not in your own heart for the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. I love your soul for you are the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ. He has paid a dear price for your redemption, and you are not your own to dispose of yourself as you may think best. You must give a solemn account in the judgment how you have appropriated your God-given powers.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LYL", "page": 84}
