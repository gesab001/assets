{"word": "The Lord calls for minutemen, men who will be prepared to speak words in season and out of season that will arrest the attention and convict the heart. The kingdom of God consisteth not in outward show. Light will not be received by following selfish plans, but by looking unto Jesus, following Christ's leading, not the suppositions of men. The kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 497}
