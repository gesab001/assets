{"word": "Jesus knew the worthlessness of earthly pomp, and He gave no attention to its display. In His dignity of soul, \n                                                                           260\nHis elevation of character, His nobility of principle, He was far above the vain fashions of the world. Although the prophet describes Him as \"despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief\" (Isaiah 53:3), He might have been esteemed as the highest among the noble of the earth. The best circles of human society would have courted Him, had He condescended to accept their favor, but He desired not the applause of men, but moved independent of all human influence. Wealth, position, worldly rank in all its varieties and distinctions of human greatness, were all but so many degrees of littleness to Him who had left the honor and glory of heaven, and who possessed no earthly splendor, indulged in no luxury, and displayed no adornment but humility.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 259}
