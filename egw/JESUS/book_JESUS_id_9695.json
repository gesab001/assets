{"word": "Prayer meeting need not be dull, spiritless, and unattractive.--Christians do not always make the public worship of God of sufficient importance. They do not realize their responsibility in the matter. The prayer-meeting, especially, is often dull, spiritless, and unattractive. But it need not be. Even where few love the hour of prayer, it may be made interesting and profitable. The presence of Jesus is not confined to large assemblies.--ST Dec. 4, 1884.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 184}
