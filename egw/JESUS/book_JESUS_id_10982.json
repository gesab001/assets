{"word": "Our work is to proclaim the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. \"Prepare to meet thy God\" (Amos 4:12), is the warning to be given to the world. It is a warning to us individually. We are called upon to lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us. There is a work for you, my brother, to do, to yoke up with Christ. Make sure that your building is on the rock. Do not risk eternity on a probability. You may \n                                                                           117\nnot live to participate in the perilous scenes on which we are now entering. The life of no one of us is assured for any given time. Should you not watch every moment? Should you not closely examine your own self, and inquire, What will eternity be to me?", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 116}
