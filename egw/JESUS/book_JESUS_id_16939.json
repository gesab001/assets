{"word": "Will it make you sad to be buffeted, despised, derided, maligned of the world? It ought not, for Jesus told us just how it would be. \"If the world hate you,\" He says, \"ye know that it hated me before it hated you\" (John 15:18). The apostle Paul, the great hero of faith, testifies: \"For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\" (Romans 8:18). \"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory\" (2 Corinthians 4:17).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 280}
