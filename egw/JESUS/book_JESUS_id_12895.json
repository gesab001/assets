{"word": "Chapter XXV. - Christ Stills the Tempest.\n\n     Jesus had been teaching and healing uninterruptedly all day, and he greatly desired retirement and rest for himself and his disciples. He therefore instructed them to accompany him to the other side of the sea. But before he embarked he was accosted by a scribe who had listened to his words, representing the jewels of truth as being of far greater value than hidden treasure. In the grossness of his darkened mind, the scribe conceived that Jesus designed to enrich his followers with worldly treasure. He therefore eagerly addressed him, as had Judas, saying, \"Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou \n                                                                           306\ngoest.\" The Saviour read the unworthy thought that actuated his heart, and answered him as he had answered Judas, \"The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.\" This Jewish teacher had only his own selfish interest in view when he proposed to follow Jesus. He hoped that the Saviour would soon establish his kingdom on earth, and that the wealth and station which would then accrue to his disciples, were the riches of which Jesus had spoken. But only a mind blinded by avarice and the lust of the world could so have misinterpreted the words of the Saviour.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 305}
