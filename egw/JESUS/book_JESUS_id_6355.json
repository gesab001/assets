{"word": "This is the course that God would have us pursue under all circumstances. He wants us to be minute men and women. He wants us to be ready always to give to every man that asketh us a reason of the hope that is within us with meekness and fear. Why with fear? It is with a fear lest we shall not make a right impression upon the mind of the inquirer; with a fear lest self shall not be out of sight, and the truth not be made to appear as it is in Jesus.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 144}
