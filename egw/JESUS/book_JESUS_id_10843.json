{"word": "Our Atoning Sacrifice \n\n     Jesus was the majesty of heaven, the beloved commander of the angels, who delighted to do His pleasure. He was one with God, \"in the bosom of the Father\" (John 1:18), yet He thought it not a thing to be desired to be equal with God while man was lost in sin and misery. He stepped down from His throne, He left His crown and royal scepter, and clothed His divinity with humanity. He humbled Himself even to the death of the cross, that man might be exalted to a seat with Him upon His throne. In Him we have a complete offering, an infinite sacrifice, a mighty Saviour, who is able to save unto the uttermost all that come unto God by Him. In love He comes to reveal the Father, to reconcile man to God, to make him a new creature renewed after the image of Him who created him.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 321}
