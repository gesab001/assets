{"word": "Put your entire trust in Jesus.  He will never leave you nor forsake you.  He says, I have graven you upon the palms of My hands.  Marian, if you go before I do, we shall know each other there.  We shall see as we are seen and know as we are known.  Just let the peace of Christ come into your soul.  Be true in your trust because He is true to His promise.  Lay your poor, nervous hand in His firm hand and let Him hold you and strengthen you, cheer and comfort you.  I will now get ready to leave this place.  Oh, I wish I were with you this moment!  In much love.  -- Letter 382, 1904.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "RY", "page": 151}
