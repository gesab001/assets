{"word": "\"Come near to the hearts that are torn this morning. Pour into them the balm of Thy Spirit, of Thy healing goodness. Fill all the vacancies that are made by death, with Thine own precious presence. Help them that mourn, to look beyond this time to the glorious morning which lies just before us, when the Lord Jesus Christ shall heal every wound that sin has made, shall comfort every heart that trusts in Him, and shall make all things eternally new.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 466}
