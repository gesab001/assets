{"word": "All we need to know is the will of the Master. He says, \\93Go forward.\\94 We should obey, even though the Red Sea were before us. He has promised to be a present help to us in every time of need. Then let us not sink down under trials, nor allow them to separate us from Jesus. As we look at the everlasting hills around us, they should remind us that God has a controversy with the nations, and that all who have lost their lives for the truth's sake will come forth \n234\nfrom where they have fallen, to be rewarded with everlasting life in the city of God. Outside the city will be those who persecuted them. As these see the great light shining upon the faithful ones from Jesus, they will wish that they had been the persecuted instead of the persecutors. What agony will come upon them, as they hear the song of triumph echo and re-echo through the courts of heaven, and realize that the despised and persecuted are finally accepted of God!", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 233}
