{"word": "The truth of God revealed in His Word is to be a living, abiding principle. It is not to be looked upon as an influence among many but that which is set over all others. It will exercise a power over the life and conduct until the whole being is assimilated to the image of the Perfect Pattern, and the human agent is complete in Jesus Christ. \"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up,\" not in self, not after men's ideas, but \"in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ\" (Colossians 2:6-8).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 27}
