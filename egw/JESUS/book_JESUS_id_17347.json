{"word": "How important that we should be rooted and grounded in the truth! No falsehood is of the truth. The Lord Jesus has promised that, if we receive Him by faith and believe in Him as our pattern, He will give us \"power to become the sons of God.\" The gospel of Jesus Christ contains the grand principles of all truth, expressed in a life of purity. In love and true righteousness these principles are to be proclaimed to the world. In all our dealings with one another we are to obey the precepts of the law of God. \"I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word\" (verses 19, 20).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 353}
