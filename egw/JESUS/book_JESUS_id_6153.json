{"word": "As Paul\\92s epistle was opened and read, great joy and consolation \n44\nwas brought to the church by the words revealing the true state of the dead. Paul showed that those living when Christ should come would not go to meet their Lord in advance of those who had fallen asleep in Jesus. The voice of the Archangel and the trump of God would reach the sleeping ones, and the dead in Christ should rise first, before the touch of immortality should be given to the living. \\93Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.\\94AA 257, 258.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 43}
