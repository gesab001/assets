{"word": "The work of the investigative Judgment and the blotting out of sins is to be accomplished before the second advent of the Lord. Since the dead are to be judged out of the things written in the books, it is impossible that the sins of men should be blotted out until after the Judgment at which their cases are to be investigated. But the apostle Peter distinctly states that the sins of believers will be blotted out, \\93when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus Christ.\\94 [Acts 3:19, 20.] When the investigative Judgment closes, Christ will come, and his reward is with him to give to every man as his work shall be.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 485}
