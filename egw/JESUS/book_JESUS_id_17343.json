{"word": "Although I did not have good sleep during the night, my peace was like a river. The love of Jesus grows in my heart, and I do love Him, and my heart flows out in grateful thanksgiving. The preciousness of divine truth presents itself with such clearness and force to my mind that I long to express it to all that I can reach to comfort, and encourage them with the consolation wherewith I myself also am comforted. I feel not the slightest depression of spirits. Pleasant views and ideas present themselves to me like precious views of gold, and my heart is all aglow and I feel an ardor of soul that seems longing to express itself.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 346}
