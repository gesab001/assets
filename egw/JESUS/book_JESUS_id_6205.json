{"word": "During His ministry, Jesus had raised the dead to life.\n105\nHe had raised the son of the widow of Nain, and the ruler\\92s daughter and Lazarus. But these were not clothed with immortality. After they were raised, they were still subject to death. But those who came forth from the grave at Christ\\92s resurrection were raised to everlasting life. They ascended with Him as trophies of His victory over death and the grave. These, said Christ, are no longer the captives of Satan; I have redeemed them. I have brought them from the grave as the first fruits of My power, to be with Me where I am, nevermore to see death or experience sorrow.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 104}
