And with what pleasure Jesus looked upon his sincere, guileless faith! \"Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. And He saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\" God never honors unbelief and questioning and doubt. When He speaks, His word is to be recognized \n                                                                           27\nand carried out in the daily actions. And if the heart of man is in living connection with God, the voice that cometh from above will be recognized.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 26}
