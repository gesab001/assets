{"word": "All the words of consolation I may give you [LETTER WRITTEN TO ELDER J. N. ANDREWS, LABORING IN EUROPE, SOON AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS DAUGHTER, MARY.] will not amount to much. You know the Source of your strength and your consolation. You are not a stranger to Jesus and His love. You are among many to whom life is a long conflict of pain and weariness and disappointment. Hope deferred has made the heart sad, but this world is the scene of our trials, our griefs, our sorrows. We are here to bear the test of God. The fire of the furnace is to kindle till our dross is consumed and we come forth as gold purified in the furnace of affliction. You may, my dear brother, ponder upon the mysterious providence of God that has taken from you the light of your eyes.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 348}
