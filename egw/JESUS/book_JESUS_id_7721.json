{"word": "No matter who you are or what your life has been, you can be saved only in God's appointed way. You must repent; you must fall helpless on the Rock, Christ Jesus. You must feel your need of a physician and of the only remedy for sin, the blood of Christ. This remedy can be secured only by repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. . . . The blood of Christ will avail for none but those who feel their need of its cleansing power.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Mar", "page": 73}
