{"word": "The Peril in Worldly Education \n\n     To many who place their children in our schools, strong temptations will come because they desire them to secure what the world regards as the most essential education. To these I would say, Bring your children to the simplicity of the word, and they will be safe. This Book is the foundation of all true knowledge. The highest education they can receive is to learn how to add to their \"faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.\" \"If these things be in you, and abound,\" the word of God declares, \"they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. . . . If ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\" 2 Peter 1:5-11.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 15}
