{"word": "To have fellowship with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ is to be ennobled and elevated, and made a partaker of joys unspeakable and full of glory. Food, clothing, station, and wealth may have their value; but to have a connection with God and to be a partaker of His divine nature is of priceless value. Our lives should be hid with Christ in God; and although it \"doth not yet appear what we shall be,\" \"when Christ, who is our life, shall appear\" (Colossians 3:4), \"we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.\" The princely dignity of the Christian character will shine forth as the sun, and the beams of light from the face of Christ will be reflected upon those who have purified themselves even as He is pure. The privilege of becoming sons of God is cheaply purchased, even at the sacrifice of everything we possess, be it life itself.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 341}
