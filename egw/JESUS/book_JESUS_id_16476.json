His word to you is, \"Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine.\" You desire to please the Lord, and you can do this by believing His promises. He is waiting to take you into a harbor of gracious experience, and He bids you, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" You have had a time of unrest; but Jesus says to you, \"Come unto Me, . . . and I will give you rest.\" The joy of Christ in the soul is worth everything. \"Then are they glad,\" because they are privileged to rest in the arms of everlasting love.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 516}
