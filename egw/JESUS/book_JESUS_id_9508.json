{"word": "There is light in following Jesus, talking of Jesus, loving Jesus, and I will not allow my mind to think or speak ill of my brethren. \"Inasmuch,\" said Christ, \"as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" Matthew 25:40. I would not feel unkindness or hatred to anyone. I would not be an accuser of my brethren. Satan will try to stir up my mind to do this, but I cannot do it. I will cherish the forgiving Spirit of Jesus.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 239}
