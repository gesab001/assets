{"word": "The true Christian will in his intercourse with men suppress words that would tend to produce unnecessary anger and strife. All Heaven is at peace, and those who are closely connected with Christ will be in harmony with Heaven. Jesus declared: \"In the world ye shall have tribulation; but in me ye shall have peace.\" Those who are in sympathy with the Saviour will not be restless and dissatisfied. They will partake of the nature of Christ, and their lives will emulate his example.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 210}
