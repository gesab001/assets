{"word": "Christ and angels are looking upon your work. They are measuring every action. Let your life represent the meek and lowly Jesus. Strive to do as Christ would do were He in your place. Let there be no disagreement between your measurement of strict integrity and the divine measure. True, pure principles must govern the life of every soul that shall be pronounced just and righteous in the day of God.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 343}
