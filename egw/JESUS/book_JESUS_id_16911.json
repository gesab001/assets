{"word": "In Christ the cry of humanity reached the Father of infinite pity. As a man He supplicated the throne of God till His humanity was charged with a heavenly current that should connect humanity with divinity. Through continual communion He received life from God, that He might impart life to the world. His experience is to be ours. \"Come ye yourselves apart\" (Mark 6:31), He bids us. If we would give heed to His Word we should be stronger and more useful. . . . If today we would take time to go to Jesus and tell Him our needs we should not be disappointed; He would be at our right hand to help us. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 259}
