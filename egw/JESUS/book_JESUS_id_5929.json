{"word": "NOTE 8. PAGE 435.\\97REVELATION 14:6, 7, FORETELLS THE PROCLAMATION OF THE FIRST ANGEL'S MESSAGE. THEN THE PROPHET CONTINUES: \\93THERE FOLLOWED ANOTHER ANGEL, SAYING, BABYLON IS FALLEN, IS FALLEN, . . . AND THE THIRD ANGEL FOLLOWED THEM.\\94 THE WORD HERE RENDERED \\93FOLLOWED,\\94 MEANS, IN CONSTRUCTIONS LIKE THAT IN THIS TEXT, \\93TO GO WITH.\\94 LIDDELL AND SCOTT RENDER THE WORD THUS: \\93TO FOLLOW ONE, GO AFTER OR WITH HIM.\\94 ROBINSON SAYS: \\94TO FOLLOW, TO GO WITH, TO ACCOMPANY ANYONE.\\94 IT IS THE SAME WORD THAT IS USED IN MARK 5:24: \\93AND JESUS WENT WITH HIM; AND MUCH PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM, AND THRONGED HIM.\\94 IT IS ALSO USED OF THE REDEEMED ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FOUR THOUSAND, WHERE IT IS SAID: \\93THESE ARE THEY WHICH FOLLOW THE LAMB WHITHERSOEVER HE GOETH.\\94 REVELATION 14:4. IN BOTH THESE PLACES IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE IDEA INTENDED TO BE CONVEYED IS THAT OF GOING TOGETHER, IN COMPANY WITH. SO IN 1 CORINTHIANS 10:4, WHERE WE READ OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THAT \\93THEY DRANK OF THAT SPIRITUAL ROCK THAT FOLLOWED THEM,\\94 THE WORD \\93FOLLOWED\\94 IS TRANSLATED FROM THE SAME GREEK WORD, AND THE MARGIN HAS IT, \\93WENT WITH THEM.\\94 FROM THIS WE LEARN THAT THE IDEA IN REVELATION 14:8, 9, IS NOT SIMPLY THAT THE SECOND AND THIRD ANGELS FOLLOWED THE FIRST IN POINT OF TIME, BUT THAT THEY WENT WITH IT. THE THREE MESSAGES ARE BUT ONE THREEFOLD MESSAGE. THEY ARE THREE ONLY IN THE ORDER OF THEIR RISE. BUT HAVING RISEN, THEY GO ON TOGETHER, AND ARE INSEPARABLE.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 685}
