For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do\" (1 Thessalonians 5:8-11).--Letter 249, Nov. 11, 1903, to P. T. Magan and E. A. Sutherland, educators leading out in the establishing of Emmanuel Missionary College.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 324}
