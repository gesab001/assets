{"word": "Gospel Truth Provides Steadfast Purpose.--Every one of us needs to have a deep insight into the teachings of the Word of God. Our minds must be prepared to stand every test and to resist every temptation, whether from without or from within. We must know why we believe as we do, why we are on the Lord's side. The truth must keep watch in our hearts, ready to sound an alarm and summon us to action against every foe. The powers of darkness will open their batteries upon us; and all who are indifferent and careless, who have set their affections on their earthly \n\n68 \n\ntreasure, and who have not cared to understand God's dealings with His people will be ready victims. No power but a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus will ever make us steadfast; but with this, one may chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight.--RH, Apr 29, 1884.
