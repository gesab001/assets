{"word": "Satan is working with great diligence to compass the ruin of the souls of men. He has come down with great power, knowing that he has but a short time to work. Our only safety lies in following closely after Christ, walking in His wisdom, and practicing His truth. We cannot always readily detect the working of Satan; we do not know where he lays his traps. But Jesus understands the subtle arts of the enemy, and He can keep our feet in safe paths. . . . \"I am the way, the truth, and the life\" (John 14:6) Christ declares.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 16}
