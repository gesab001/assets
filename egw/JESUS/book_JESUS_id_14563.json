{"word": "Here is a channel wholly devoted to himself, under his control, and he can make the world believe what he will. The Book that is to judge him and his followers, he puts back in the shade, just where he wants it. The Saviour of the world he makes to be no more than a common man; and as the Roman guard that watched the tomb of Jesus, spread the false and lying report that the chief priests and elders put in their mouth, so will the poor, deluded followers of these pretended spiritual manifestations, repeat, and try to make it appear that there is nothing miraculous about our Saviour's birth, death and resurrection; and they put Jesus back, with the Bible, in the shade, where they want him, and then get the world looking to them and their lying wonders and miracles, which they declare far exceed the works of Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ExV54", "page": 10}
