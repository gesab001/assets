{"word": "Let the canvasser remember that he has an opportunity to sow beside all waters. Let him remember, as he sells the books which give a knowledge of the truth, that he is doing the work of God, and that every talent is to be used to the glory of His name. God will be with every one who seeks to understand the truth that he may set it before others in clear lines. God has spoken plainly and clearly: \\93The Spirit and the bride say, Come; and let him that heareth say, Come.\\94 Revelation 22:17. We are to make no delay in giving instruction to those who need it, that they may be brought to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MC", "page": 7}
