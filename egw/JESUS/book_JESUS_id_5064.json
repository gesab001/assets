{"word": "I saw a throne, and on it sat the Father and the Son. I gazed on Jesus' countenance and admired His lovely person. The Father's person I could not behold, for a cloud of glorious light covered Him. I asked Jesus if His Father had a form like Himself. He said He had, but I could not behold it, for said He, \"If you should once behold the glory of His person, you would cease to exist.\" . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 71}
