{"word": "Conformity to the World \n\n     The Lord Jesus has said: \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.\" Luke 9:23. Christ's words made an impression on the minds of His hearers. Many of them, though not clearly comprehending His instruction, were moved by deep conviction to say decidedly: \"Never man spake like this Man.\" John 7:46. The disciples did not always understand the lessons which Christ wished to convey by parables, and when the multitude had gone away, they would ask Him to explain His words. He was ever ready to lead them to a perfect understanding of His word and His will; for from them, in clear, distinct lines, truth was to go forth to the world.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "6T", "page": 248}
