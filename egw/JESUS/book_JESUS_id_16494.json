{"word": "Now as you enter a new field, elevate the work from the very commencement. Place it on a high level, and have all your efforts of such a character as to bring all who are interested in the truth to a noble, elevated platform, corresponding with the magnitude of the work that they may have a proper education and be able to teach others. The truth is of heavenly origin, and it has been mercifully given to us in trust by Heaven. May the Lord strengthen and bless you both, that you may work out self and weave Jesus into all your labours, and then the blessing of God will rest upon you.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 20}
