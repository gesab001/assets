{"word": "Temptations will come. But when Satan throws his hellish shadow before us, we should reach in faith through the shadow to the light of life--to Him who has not only created man but who by His own blood has redeemed him. We are Christ's cherished heritage. In living faith we must cooperate with Him in working out our own salvation. Amid trials and temptations His hand upholds and sustains us. Those who rest in Christ Jesus are never restless or uneasy. He means just what He says when He bids us commit the keeping of our souls unto Him, as to a faithful Creator.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 292}
