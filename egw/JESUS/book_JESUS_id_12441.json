{"word": "Simeon said of Christ, \"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.\" \"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\" Jesus and John were represented by the educators of that day as ignorant, because they had not learned under them. But the God of heaven was their teacher, and all who heard were astonished at their knowledge of the Scripture, having never learned. Of them, they had not, truly; but from God they had learned the highest kind of wisdom.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 152}
