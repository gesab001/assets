{"word": "The sin of Adam and Eve caused a fearful separation between God and man. And Christ steps in between fallen man and God, and says to man: \"You may yet come to the Father; there is a plan devised through which God can be reconciled to man, and man to God; through a mediator you can approach God.\" And now He stands to mediate for you. He is the great High Priest who is pleading in your behalf; and you are to come and present your case to the Father through Jesus Christ. Thus you can find access to God; and though you sin, your case is not hopeless. \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2T", "page": 591}
