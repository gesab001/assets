His own love and care for children is a precious example for his followers. If teachers in the Sabbath-school felt the love which they should feel for these lambs of the flock, many more would be won to the fold of Christ.

The servant of Christ may have lasting friends in these little ones, and his words may be to them as apples of gold in pictures of silver.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 405}
