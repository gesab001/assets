{"word": "God's Love for His People\n     I have seen the tender love that God has for his people, and it is very great. I saw an angel over every saint, with their wings spread about them; and if the saints wept through discouragement, or were in danger, the angel that ever attended them would fly quickly upward to carry the tidings, and \n22\nthe angels in the City would cease to sing. Then Jesus would commission another angel to descend to encourage, watch over and try to keep them from going out of the narrow path; but if they did not take heed to the watchful care of these angels, and would not be comforted by them, and continued to go astray, the angels would look sad and weep. Then they would bear the tidings upward and all the angels in the City would weep, and then with a loud voice say, Amen. But if the saints fixed their eyes on the prize before them, and glorified God by praising him, then the angels would bear the glad tidings to the City, and the angels in the City would touch their golden harps and sing with a loud voice\\97Alleluia! and the heavenly arches would ring with their lovely songs. I will here state, that there is perfect order and harmony in the Holy City.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ExV", "page": 21}
