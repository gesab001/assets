{"word": "Chap. 100 - The Tithe\n\n     The great work which Jesus announced that He came to do was intrusted to His followers upon the earth. Christ, as our head, leads out in the great work of salvation, and bids us follow His example. He has given us a world-wide message. This truth must be extended to all nations, tongues, and people. Satan's power was to be contested, and he was to be overcome by Christ and also by His followers. An extensive war was to be maintained against the powers of darkness. And in order to do this work successfully, means were required. God does not propose to send means direct from heaven, but He gives into the hands of His followers talents of means to use for the very purpose of sustaining this warfare.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 304}
