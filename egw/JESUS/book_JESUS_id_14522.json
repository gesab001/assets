{"word": "Many who professed to love the Saviour declared that they had no opposition to the preaching of His coming; they merely objected to the definite time. God's all-seeing eye read their hearts. They did not wish to hear of Christ's coming to judge the world in righteousness. They had been unfaithful servants, their works would not bear the inspection of the heart-searching God, and they feared to meet their Lord. Like the Jews at the time of Christ's first advent, they were not prepared to welcome Jesus. Satan and his angels exulted and flung the taunt in the face of\n361\nChrist and holy angels, that His professed people had so little love for Him that they did not desire His appearing.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 360}
