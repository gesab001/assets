{"word": "But the difficulty lies with the individual members of the church, and it is here that the cure must be wrought. Jesus bids the accuser first cast the beam out of his own eye, renounce his censorious spirit, confess and forsake his own sin, before trying to correct others. For \"a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\" Luke 6:43. This accusing spirit which you indulge is evil fruit, and shows that the tree is evil. It is useless for you to build yourselves up in self-righteousness. What you need is a change of heart. You must have this experience before you are fitted to correct others; for \"out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\" Matthew 12:34.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MB", "page": 127}
