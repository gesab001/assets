{"word": "\\93The love of Christ constraineth us.\\94 [2 Corinthians 5:14.] We must cherish love; and if those for whom we labor do not appreciate our efforts, we must not allow discontent or wrong feelings to rule in our hearts. Murmuring thoughts; jealousies, and evil surmisings imbitter the life and mar the labors. It is the Lord who has called us to this work, and we should have an eye single to his glory. We cannot trust to our own efforts, as though we could do the work of converting souls. God alone can convict and convert. Jesus invites sinners to come to him with all their burdens, and he will give them rest and peace.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 423}
