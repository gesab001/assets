{"word": "Satan is continuing the work on earth that he commenced in heaven. He leads men to transgress the commandments of God. The plain \"Thus saith the Lord\" is put aside for the \"thus saith\" of men. The whole world needs to be instructed in the oracles of God, to understand the object of the atonement, the at-one-ment, with God. The object of this atonement was that the divine law and government might be maintained. The sinner is pardoned through repentance toward God and faith in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. There is forgiveness of sin, and yet the law of God stands immutable, eternal as His throne. There is no such thing as weakening or strengthening the law of Jehovah. As it has always been, so it is. It cannot be repealed or changed in one principle. It is eternal, immutable as God Himself.--Manuscript 163, 1897. \n\n(472)", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "7ABC", "page": 471}
