{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     Whatever your work, dear brethren and sisters, do it for the Master, and do your best. Do not overlook present, golden opportunities and let your life prove a failure, while you sit idly dreaming of ease and success in a work for which God has not fitted you. Do the work that is nearest. Do it, even though it may be amid the perils and hardships of the missionary field. Look at the Waldenses. See what plans they devised, and what hardships they willingly endured that the light of the gospel might shine into benighted minds. Christ laid aside His glory, and came to this earth to suffer for sinners. If we meet with hardships in our work, let us look to Him who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Then we shall not fail nor be discouraged. We shall endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ. Remember what He says of all true believers: \\93We are laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\\94 1 Corinthians 3:9.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MC", "page": 27}
