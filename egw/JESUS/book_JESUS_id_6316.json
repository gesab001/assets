{"word": "Even so Satan will come in among us, and sow discord if he can. How shall we resist him? By each cultivating love and forbearance in his own heart toward his brethren. If you see that one of your brethren is in fault, do not turn from him: and speak against him; but see how much good you can do him by treating him tenderly. Instead of allowing selfish feelings to arise, and seeking to preserve personal dignity, let self drop out of sight. Jesus with his long human arm encircles the fallen race and seeks to connect them with the throne of the Infinite. This is the work that you should be engaged in. Do not disappoint Jesus by your dissensions.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 125}
