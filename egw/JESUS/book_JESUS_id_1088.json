{"word": "We come unto God in the name of Jesus by special invitation, and he welcomes us to his audience chamber, and imparts to the humble and contrite heart that faith in Christ by which he is justified, and Jesus blots out as a thick cloud his transgressions by the bright sunshine of his love, and the comforted heart exclaims, \"O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.\" [Isaiah 12:1.] He will understand in experience the words of Paul, \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\" [Romans 10:10.] He then becomes a sanctified agent that God can employ to work out his noble purposes. He then represents Christ, holding forth to the world his mercy and love. He has a testimony that he is desirous that others should hear, and in the language of the psalmist, he says, \"Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; \n                                                                           129\nwho crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercy.\" [Psalm 103:1-4.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CE", "page": 128}
