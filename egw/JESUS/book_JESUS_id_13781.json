{"word": "Satan counselled with his angels, and with bitter hatred against God's government, told them that while he retained his power and authority upon earth, their efforts must be tenfold stronger against the followers of Jesus. They had prevailed nothing against Jesus; but his followers they must overthrow if possible, and carry on his work through every generation, to ensnare those who should believe in Jesus, his resurrection and ascension. Satan related to his angels that Jesus had given his disciples power to cast them out, rebuke them, and heal those whom he should afflict. Then Satan's angels went forth like roaring lions, seeking to destroy the followers of Jesus. \n                                                                           80", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SG", "page": 79}
