{"word": "Our young people need to be surrounded with wholesome, uplifting influences. They are to be kept in the love of the truth. The standard set before them should be high. Some feel a desire to be left without restraint, that they may do as they please. . . . The fathers and mothers . . . in the church are under sacred obligation to watch for the souls of their children as they that must give an account. Let none, neither parents nor the youth, begin to believe that amusements are essential, and that a careless disregard of the Holy Spirit during hours of selfish pleasure is to be lightly regarded. God will not be mocked. Let every young man, every young woman, consider, \"Am I prepared today for my life to close? Have I the heart preparation that fits me to do the work which the Lord has given me to do?\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 138}
