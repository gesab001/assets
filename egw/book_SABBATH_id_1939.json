{"word": "God said, \"The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God.\" He placed His sanctity upon this day and blessed it and hallowed it as a day of rest. . . .It is the only commandment in the whole Decalogue that tells who God is. It places God in distinction with every other god. It says the God that made the heaven and the earth, the God that made the trees and the flowers and that created man; this is the God that you are to keep before your children, and you have only to point to the flowers and tell them that He made these and that He rested on the seventh day from all His labors. . . . The seventh day is a God-given memorial.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 59}
