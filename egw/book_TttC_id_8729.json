    "word": "No man, without divine aid, can attain to this knowledge of God. The apostle says that \"the world by wisdom knew not God.\" Christ \"was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.\" Jesus declared to His disciples: \"No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.\" In that last prayer for His followers, before entering the shadows of Gethsemane, the Saviour lifted His eyes to heaven, and in pity for the ignorance of fallen men He said: \"O righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee: but I have known Thee.\" \n                                                                           738\n\"I have manifested Thy name unto the men which Thou gavest Me out of the world.\"",
