{"word": "Men lived nearly a thousand years in those days, and angels visited them with instruction directly from Christ. \n                                                                           231\nThe worship of God through sacrificial offerings was established, and those who feared God acknowledged their sins before Him, and looked forward with gratitude and holy trust to the coming of the Day Star, which should guide the fallen sons of Adam to heaven, through repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Thus the gospel was preached in every sacrifice; and the works of the believers continually revealed their faith in a coming Saviour. Jesus said to the Jews: \"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?\" (John 5:46, 47).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 230}
