{"word": "There has never been a time when the people of God have had greater need to claim His promises than now. Let the hand of faith pass through the darkness, and grasp the arm of infinite power. While we speak of the necessity of separating from sin, remember that Christ came to our world to save sinners, and that \"he is able to also save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.\" It is our privilege to believe that His blood is able to cleanse us from every spot and stain of sin. We must not limit the power of the Holy One of Israel. He wants us to come to Him just as we are, sinful and polluted. His blood is efficacious. I entreat you not to grieve His Spirit by continuing in sin. If you fall under temptation, do not become discouraged. This promise comes ringing down along the line to our time: \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\" I feel that for this one promise a continual song of thanksgiving ought to go forth from the lips of mortals. Let us gather up these precious jewels of promise, and when Satan accuses us of our great sinfulness, and attempts us to doubt the power of God to save, let us repeat the words of Christ, \"Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out\" (Historical Sketches, pp. 157, 158). \n                                                                           342", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 341}
