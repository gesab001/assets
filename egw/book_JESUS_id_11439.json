{"word": "43 (Mark 14:40; Luke 22:45). Picture of a Sleeping Church.--In this fearful hour of trial Christ's human nature longed even for the sympathy of His disciples. A second time He rose from the earth and went to them and found them sleeping. This was not a deep sleep. They were in a drowse. They had a limited sense of their Lord's suffering and anguish. In tenderness Jesus stood for a moment bending over them, and regarding them with mingled feelings of love and pity. In these sleeping disciples He sees a representation of a sleeping church. When they should be watching, they are asleep (Sufferings of Christ, pp. 19, 20).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1104}
