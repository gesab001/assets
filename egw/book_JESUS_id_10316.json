{"word": "No other life was ever so crowded with labor and responsibility as was that of Jesus; yet how often He was found in prayer! How constant was His communion with God! Again and again in the history of His earthly life are found records such as these:... \"Great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.\" \"And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God\" (Luke 5:15, 16; 6:12).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 118}
