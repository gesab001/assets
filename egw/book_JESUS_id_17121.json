{"word": "We cannot even manufacture faith ourselves. \"It is the gift of God: (Ephesians 2:8). The whole of our salvation comes through the gift of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. How glad I am. It comes from such a source that we cannot doubt it. And He is \"the author\"--does it stop there? Does it stop there? \"The author and finisher of our faith\" (Hebrews 12:2). Thank God. He attends us every step of the way through, if we are willing to be saved in Christ's appointed way, through obedience to His requirements. \"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God\" (Ephesians 2:8). \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling\" (Philippians 2:12). What does this mean? Is it a contradiction? Let us see what the last of it says. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure\" (verses 12, 13). Praise God. Now who will be discouraged? Who is going to faint? It is not committed to us, weak, feeble mortals to work out our own salvation in our own line. It is Christ that worketh in you. And this is the privilege of every son and daughter of Adam. But we are to work. We are not to be idle. We are put here in this world to work. We are not put here to fold our arms.--Manuscript 18, March 4, 1894, \"Laborers Together With God.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 72}
