{"word": "Calumny and reproach will be the recompense of those who stand for the truth as it is in Jesus. \"All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution\" (2 Timothy 3:12). Those who bear a plain testimony against sin will as surely be hated as was the Master who gave them this work to do in His name.

But we should not be discouraged when thus treated.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 73}
