    "word": "12 (ch. 3:25; Ephesians 1:7). The Law Holds Its Dignity.--Through the plan of salvation the law holds its dignity in condemning the sinner, and the sinner can be saved through the propitiation of Christ for our sins, \"in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.\" The law is not changed in any particular to meet man in his fallen condition. It remains what it ever has been--holy, just, and good (RH May 23, 1899).",
