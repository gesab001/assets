    "word": "Chapter 7 \n\n     1, 2 (Luke 6:37; Romans 2:1; see EGW on 1 Samuel 14:44). Satan Judged by Own Idea of Justice.--Satan will be judged by his own idea of justice. It was his plea that every sin should meet its punishment. If God remitted the punishment, he said, He was not a God of truth or justice. Satan will meet the judgment which he said God should exercise (MS 111, 1897).",
