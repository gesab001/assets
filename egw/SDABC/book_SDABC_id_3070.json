    "word": "Chapter 13 \n\n     11-13 (Galatians 3:13). He Suffered Without the Camp.--As Adam and Eve were banished from Eden for transgressing the law of God, so Christ was to suffer without the boundaries of the holy place. He died outside the camp, where felons and murderers were executed. There He trod the winepress alone, bearing the penalty that should have fallen on the sinner. How deep and full of significance are the words, \"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.\" He went forth without the camp, thus showing that He gave His life not only for the Jewish nation, but for the whole world (YI June 28, 1900).",
