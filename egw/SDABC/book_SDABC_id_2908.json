    "word": "(Exodus 3:5.) God's Word Not to Be Dissected.--It takes all of eternity to unfold the glories and bring out the precious treasures of the Word of God. Do not let any living man come to you and begin to dissect God's Word, telling what is revelation, what is inspiration and what is not, without a rebuke. Tell all such they simply do not know. They simply are not able to comprehend the things of the mystery of God. What we want is to inspire faith. We want no one to say, \"This I will reject, and this will I receive,\" but we want to have implicit faith in the Bible as a whole and as it is. \n                                                                           920",
