    "word": "Ministers of God have been guilty of the sin of disregarding a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" They have led the members of their churches to observe rites which have no foundation in the word of God, but are in direct opposition to His law. By perversion and misrepresentation of the Word of God, they have caused the people to commit sin. God will reward them according to their works. Even as did the priests and rulers in the time of Christ, they have caused the people to err. Christ says of them as He said of the Jewish leaders, \"In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men\" (MS 28, 1900).",
