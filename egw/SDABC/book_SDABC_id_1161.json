    "word": "6. The Coronation Day.--On the Saviour's coronation day He will not acknowledge as His any who bear spot or wrinkle. But to His faithful ones He will give crowns of immortal glory. Those who would not that He should reign over them will see Him surrounded by the army of the redeemed, each bearing the sign, The Lord our Righteousness. They will see the head once crowned with thorns crowned with a diadem of glory (RH May 5, 1903).",
