    "word": "34 (see EGW on 1 John 3:16-18). A New Conception of Love.--Why was this called \"a new commandment\"? The disciples had not loved one another as Christ had loved them. They had not yet seen the fullness of the love that He was to reveal in man's behalf. They were yet to see Him dying on the cross for their sins. Through His life and death they were to receive a new conception of love. The command to \"love one another\" was to gain a new meaning in the light of His self-sacrifice. In the light shining from the cross of Calvary they were to read the meaning of the words, \"As I have loved you, that ye also love one another\" (RH June 30, 1910).",
