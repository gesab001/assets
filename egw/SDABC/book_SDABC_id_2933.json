    "word": "14 (see EGW on Acts 10:1-6; Revelation 5:11). Power and Efficiency for the Church.--Divine ministration is needed to give power and efficiency to the church in this world. God's family on earth, subject to temptations and trials, is very near to His heart of love. He has ordained that communication be kept up between heavenly intelligences and His children on this earth. Angels from the courts above are sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation (MS 142, 1899).",
