    "word": "18, 19 (Matthew 19:28;  25:31; Romans 8:17; 1 Peter 4:13). A Transformed Peter. --[John 21:18-22 quoted.] Peter was now humble enough to understand the words of Christ, and without further questioning, the once restless, boastful, self-confident disciple became subdued and contrite. He followed his Lord indeed--the Lord he had denied. The thought that Christ had not denied and rejected him was to Peter a light and comfort and blessing. He felt that he could be crucified from choice, but it must be with his head downward. And he who was so close a partaker of Christ's sufferings will also be a partaker of His glory when He shall \"sit upon the throne of his glory\" (YI Dec. 22, 1898).",
