    "word": "Jesus asks us to consecrate ourselves to Him. He has placed signal honor upon the human race; for He says, \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\" Shall we not, then, give to Christ that which He has died to redeem? If you will do this, He will quicken your conscience, renew your heart, sanctify your affections, purify your thoughts, and set all your powers at work for Him. Every motive and every thought will be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ.",
