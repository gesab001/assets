    "word": "When Christ's indwelling glory flashed forth, it was too intense for His pure and perfect humanity entirely to conceal. The scribes and Pharisees did not speak in acknowledgment of Him, but their enmity and hatred were baffled as His majesty shone forth. The truth, obscured as it was by a veil of humiliation, spoke to every heart with unmistakable evidence. This led to the words of Christ, \"Ye know who I am.\" Men and devils were compelled, by the shining forth of His glory, to confess, \"Truly, this is the Son of God.\" Thus God was revealed; thus Christ was glorified (ST May 10, 1899).",
