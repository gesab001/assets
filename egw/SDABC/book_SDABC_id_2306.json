    "word": "17 (Galatians 4:7). Privileges for God's Obedient Children.--God loves His obedient children. He has a kingdom prepared, not for disloyal subjects, but for His children whom He has tested and tried in a world marred and corrupted by sin. As obedient children, we have the privilege of relationship with God. \"If children,\" He says, \"then heirs\" to an immortal inheritance. . . . Christ and His people are one (Letter 119, 1897).",
