    "word": "This whole chapter is of importance to all the people of God living in this age. In the business that He desires men of His appointment to carry on for the safety and prosperity of His kingdom, the Lord does not link together scattered elements that have not had a genuine experience, and that give no promise of developing characters that may be depended upon to bear responsibilities in connection with the work of molding and fashioning a nation to do a most solemn, sacred service for God, consistent with the uplifted, purified state of a people who represent Him.",
