    "word": "Those who have lived on the flesh and blood of the Son of God--His Holy Word--will be strengthened, rooted, and grounded in the faith. They will see increased evidence why they should prize and obey the Word of God. With David, they will say, \"They have made void thy law. Therefore love I thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.\" While others count them dross, they will arise to defend the faith. All who study their convenience, their pleasure, their enjoyment, will not stand in their trial (RH June 8, 1897).",
