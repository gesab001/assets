    "word": "10 (John 5:22; Romans 14:10; see EGW on Romans 3:19). Christ the Judge.--God designed that the Prince of sufferers in humanity should be judge of the whole world. He who submitted to be arraigned before an earthly tribunal, He who came from the heavenly courts to save man from eternal death, He whom men despised, rejected, and upon whom they heaped all the contempt of which human beings inspired by Satan are capable, He who suffered the ignominious death of the cross--He alone was to pronounce the sentence of reward or of punishment (MS 39, 1898).",
