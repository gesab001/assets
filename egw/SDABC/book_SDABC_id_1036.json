    "word": "Chapter 8 \n\n     12 (see EGW comments on ch. 5:18-23). Satan Seeks to Widen Distance Between Heaven and Earth.--The satanic agencies are constantly at work, sowing and watering the seeds of rebellion against the law of God, and Satan is gathering souls under his black banner of revolt. He forms a confederacy with human beings to contend against purity and holiness. He has worked diligently, perseveringly, increasing the number who will confederate with him. By his representations he seeks to widen the distance between heaven and earth, and he grows into the conviction that he can wear out the patience of God, extinguish His love for man, and bring condemnation upon the whole human family (RH Oct. 21, 1902).",
