    "word": "Learning the Trade of Character Building.--\"Ye are God's building.\" You are representatives of the great Master Worker. God forbid that we should neglect to learn the trade of character building. The course to be pursued in this work is not according to the ideas of the world; the fashioning is not similar to the fashioning of the world. Those who enter the work of God without hiding self in Christ will soon disconnect themselves from the Master's building (MS 165, 1899).",
