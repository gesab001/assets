Fearful of Bringing Self Into Work.--When, after Moses' time of preparation and trial was over, he was once more told to go and deliver Israel, he was self-distrustful, slow of speech, timid. \"Who am I,\" he said, \"that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\" He pleaded as an excuse a lack of ready speech. He had been the general of the armies of Egypt, and he certainly knew how to speak. But he was afraid that he would bring self into his work (MS 11, 1903).",
