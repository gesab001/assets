    "word": "(Ch. 13:16, 17.) Warning Against Mark of the Beast.--The third angel's message has been sent forth to the world, warning men against receiving the mark of the beast or of his image in their foreheads or in their hands. To receive this mark means to come to the same decision as the beast has done, and to advocate the same ideas, in direct opposition to the Word of God. Of all who receive this mark, God says, \"The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and \n                                                                           980\nhe shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.\" . . .",
