    "word": "11. Power That Controls Waves Can Control Rebellion.--Nothing can happen in any part of the universe without the knowledge of Him who is omnipresent. Not a single event of human life is unknown to our Maker. While Satan is constantly devising evil, the Lord our God overrules all, so that it will not harm His obedient, trusting children.

God says to one as to the other, \"Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.\"",
