He is interceding for us. By His work the threshold of heaven is flushed with the glory of God which will shine upon every soul who will open the windows of the soul heavenward. As the prayers of the sincere and contrite ones ascend to heaven Christ says to the Father, \"I will take their sins. Let them stand before you innocent.\" As He takes their sins from them, He fills their hearts with the glorious light of truth and love (MS 28, 1901).",
