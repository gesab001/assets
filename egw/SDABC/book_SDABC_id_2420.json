    "word": "Paul did not depend upon man for his ordination. He had received from the Lord his commission and ordination. He regarded his ministerial labor as a privilege. To him it was not a duty performed in return for money. He labored for the souls of men. \"For though I preach the gospel,\" he said, \"I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me: yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!\" He studied constantly how to make his testimony of the greatest effect. He sought the approval of God.",
