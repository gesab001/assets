    "word": "24. No Moral Darkness So Dense.--Enoch walked with God, while of the world around him sacred history records, \"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\" Enoch's righteous life was in marked contrast with the wicked people around him. His piety, his purity, his unswerving integrity were the result of his walking with God, while the wickedness of the world was the result of their walking with the deceiver of mankind. There never has been and never will be an age when the moral darkness will be so dense as when Enoch lived a life of irreproachable righteousness (MS 43, 1900).",
