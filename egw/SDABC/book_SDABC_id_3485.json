    "word": "13, 14 (2 Thessalonians 2:7-12; see EGW on ch. 16:13-16; Matthew 7:21-23). Miracles Performed in Our Sight.--The time is at hand when Satan will work miracles to confirm minds in the belief that he is God. All the people of God are now to stand on the platform of truth as it has been given in the third angel's message. All the pleasant pictures, all the miracles wrought, will be presented in order that, if possible, the very elect will be deceived. The only hope for anyone is to hold fast the evidences that have confirmed the truth in righteousness (RH Aug. 9, 1906).",
