    "word": "Chapter 15 \n\n     2, 3 (Exodus 17:14-16). Destruction of Amalek Not to Add to Israel's Possessions.--God did not wish His people to possess anything which belonged to the Amalekites, for His curse rested upon them and their possessions. He designed that they should have an end, and that His people should not preserve anything for themselves which He had cursed. He also wished the nations to see the end of that people who had defied Him, and to mark that they were destroyed by the very people they had despised. They were not to destroy them to add to their own possessions, or to get glory to themselves, but to fulfill the Word of the Lord spoken in regard to Amalek (1SP 364).",
