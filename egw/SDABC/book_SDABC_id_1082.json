    "word": "Think of Christ's humiliation. He took upon Himself fallen, suffering human nature, degraded and defiled by sin. He took our sorrows, bearing our grief and shame. He endured all the temptations wherewith man is beset. He united humanity with divinity: a divine spirit dwelt in a temple of flesh. He united Himself with the temple. \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,\" because by so doing He could associate with the sinful, sorrowing sons and daughters of Adam (YI Dec. 20, 1900).",
