    "word": "One of the divine plans for growth is impartation. The Christian is to gain strength by strengthening others. \"He that watereth shall be watered also himself.\" This is not merely a promise; it is a divine law, a law by which God designs that the streams of benevolence, like the waters of the great deep, shall be kept in constant circulation, continually flowing back to their source. In the fulfilling of this law is the secret of spiritual growth (ST June 12, 1901).",
