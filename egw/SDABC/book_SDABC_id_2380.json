    "word": "(Acts 17:22-34.) Spiritual Power Not in Human Wisdom.--[1 Corinthians 2:1-9 quoted.] The apostle Paul had all the privileges of a Roman citizen. He was not behind in the Hebrew education, for he had learned at the feet of Gamaliel; but all this did not enable him to reach the highest standard.
