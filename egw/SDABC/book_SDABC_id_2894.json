    "word": "The work of purification is an individual work. No one can do this work for another. \"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the Master's use.\" The Spirit of God will work through sanctified human agencies, leading them to work aright. Ability and grace will be provided. Men will be filled with an earnest desire to preach the truths of the gospel, firmly, decidedly, and in a clear manner (RH Feb. 5, 1901).",
