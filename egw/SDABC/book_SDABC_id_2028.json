    "word": "(1 Thessalonians 4:3; 2 Timothy 3:16.) The Textbook of Sanctification.--The Bible is the standard by which to test the claims of all who profess sanctification. Jesus prayed that His disciples might be sanctified through the truth, and He says, \"Thy word is truth;\" while the psalmist declares, \"Thy law is the truth.\" All whom God is leading will manifest a high regard for the Scriptures in which His voice is heard. The Bible will be to them \"profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.\" \"Ye shall know them by their fruits.\" We need no other evidence in order to judge of men's sanctification; if they are fearful lest they shall not obey the whole will of God, if they are listening diligently to His voice, trusting in His wisdom, and making His Word the man of their counsel, then, while they make no boasts of superior goodness, we may be sure that they are seeking to attain to perfection of Christian character. But if the claimants of holiness even intimate that they are no longer required to search the Scriptures, we need not hesitate to pronounce their sanctification spurious. They are leaning to their own understanding, instead of conforming to the will of God (RH Oct. 5, 1886).",
