    "word": "(2 Corinthians 6:17, 18; 7:1; Colossians 3:1.) Imprint of God Received by Baptism.--Christ made baptism the entrance to His spiritual kingdom. He made this a positive condition with which all must comply who wish to be acknowledged as under the authority of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Those who receive the ordinance of baptism thereby make a public declaration that they have renounced the world, and have become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King.",
