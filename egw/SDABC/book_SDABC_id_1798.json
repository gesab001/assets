    "word": "10 (Ephesians 1:6; 2:8-10; 2 Timothy 1:9; Titus 2:14;  3:5; James 2:22). Good Works No Plea for Salvation.--Our acceptance with God is sure only through His beloved Son, and good works are but the result of the working of His sin-pardoning love. They are no credit to us, and we have nothing accorded to us for our good works by which we may claim a part in the salvation of our souls. Salvation is God's free gift to the believer, given to him for Christ's sake alone. The troubled soul may find peace through faith in Christ, and his peace will be in proportion to his faith and trust. He cannot present his good works as a plea for the salvation of his soul.",
