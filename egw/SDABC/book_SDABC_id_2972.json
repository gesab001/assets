    "word": "Not Angelic but Human Nature.--The Lord Jesus has made a great sacrifice in order to meet man where he is. He took not on Him the nature of angels. He did not come to save angels. It is the seed of Abraham that He is helping. \"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\" Christ helps humanity by taking human nature (Letter 97, 1898).",
