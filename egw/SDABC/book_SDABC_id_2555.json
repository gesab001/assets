When we are tempted to withhold that which is needed in foreign fields, let us study the eighth and ninth chapters of Second Corinthians, and learn to emulate the liberal spirit which made the Macedonians willing to give \"beyond their power\" to the cause that called for their assistance (MS 11, 1908).",
