    "word": "10-12 (chs. 4:3; 10:1; see EGW on ch. 10:7; 2 Peter 3:9). Christ's Intercession Soon to Cease.--The One who has stood as our intercessor; who hears all penitential prayers and confessions; who is represented with a rainbow, the symbol of grace and love, encircling His head, is soon to cease His work in the heavenly sanctuary. Grace and mercy will then descend from the throne, and justice will take their place. He for whom His people have looked will assume His right--the office of Supreme Judge (RH Jan. 1, 1889).",
