    "word": "(Romans 3:24-28.) Holiness Within the Reach of All.--God has chosen men from eternity to be holy. \"This is the will of God, even your sanctification.\" God's law tolerates no sin, but demands perfect obedience. The echo of God's voice comes to us, ever saying. Holier, holier still. And ever our answer is to be, Yes, Lord, holier still. Holiness is within the reach of all who reach for it by faith, not because of their good works, but because of Christ's merits. Divine power is provided for every soul struggling for the victory over sin and Satan.",
