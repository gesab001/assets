    "word": "1-3. Spiritual Dwarfs.--Paul longed to speak to the church in Corinth of spiritual things. But to his sorrow he found it in great weakness. The church members could not even bear to hear the truth concerning themselves. [1 Corinthians 3:1, 2 quoted.] The Spiritual growth of this people was so dwarfed that a plain \"Thus saith the Lord\" was an offense to them. Paul knew that by giving them the truth he would be ranked as an accuser and faultfinder (MS 74, 1899).",
