    "word": "3, 4 (Exodus 32:1-6; see EGW on Numbers 15:38, 39). The Buds and Blossoms of Pride.--There are idols cherished in our families and in our churches today which have the same influence upon us as did the golden calf upon the Israelites. Will the people search themselves? Will the shepherds do their work as faithful sentinels of God? Will they see what idols they are cherishing? Will every one that is in moderate circumstances consider that they are to be a people distinct and separate in their fashions of dress, their speech, their deportment, from the world? Will they see their idolatry in small as well as in large matters, and that it is separating them from God? When reproofs come they are ashamed, but not repentant. They have had great light, great opportunities, line upon line, and precept upon precept, but pride buds and blossoms in their apparel, revealing the thoughts and intents of the heart (MS 52, 1898).",
