    "word": "Chapter 22 \n\n     3, 4. David's Care for His Parents.--David's anxiety was not all for himself, although he realized his peril. He thought of his father and mother, and he concluded that he must seek another refuge for them. He went to the king of Moab, and the Lord put it into the heart of the monarch to courteously grant to the beloved parents of David an asylum in Mizpeh, and they were not disturbed, even in the midst of the enemies of Israel. From this history, we may all learn precious lessons of filial love. The Bible plainly condemns the unfaithfulness of parents to their children, \n                                                                           1019\nand the disobedience of children to their parents. Religion in the home is of priceless value (ST Sept. 7, 1888).",
