    "word": "Watch, brethren, the first dimming of your light, the first neglect of prayer, the first symptom of spiritual slumber. \"He that endureth to the end shall be saved.\" It is by the constant exercise of faith and love that believers are made to shine as lights in the world. You are making but poor preparation for the Master's coming if you are serving mammon while professedly serving God. When He appears, you must then present to Him the talents that you have buried in the earth, talents neglected, abused, misused--a divided love.",
