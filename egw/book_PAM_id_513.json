{"word": "The wedding ceremony is a sacred service, not a time for hilarity.--It has always seemed so very inappropriate to me to see the marriage ordinance associated with hilarity and glee and a pretense of something. No. It is an ordinance ordained of God, to be looked upon with the greatest solemnity. As the family relation is formed here below, it is to give a demonstration of what they shall be, the family in heaven above. The glory of God is ever to be made first.--AH 101.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 202}
