    "word": "To those who are indifferent at this time Christ's warning is: \"Because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of My mouth.\" Revelation 3:16. The figure of spewing out of His mouth means that He cannot offer up your prayers or your expressions of love to God. He cannot endorse your teaching of His word or your spiritual work in anywise. He cannot present your religious exercises with the request that grace be given you. \n\n                                               -",
