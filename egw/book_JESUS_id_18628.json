{"word": "The only hope of our churches is to keep wide awake. Those who are well grounded in the truth of the Word, those who test everything by a \"Thus saith the Lord\" are safe. The Holy Spirit will guide those who prize the wisdom of God above the deceptive sophistries of satanic agencies. Let there be much praying, not in human lines but under the inspiration of love of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ. The families who believe the truth are to speak words of wisdom and intelligence--words that will come to them as the result of searching the Scriptures.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 125}
