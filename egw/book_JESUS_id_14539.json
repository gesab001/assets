{"word": "I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven. An angel with a writer's inkhorn by his side returned from the earth and reported to Jesus that his work was done, and the saints were numbered and sealed. Then I saw Jesus, who had been ministering before the ark containing the Ten Commandments, throw down the censer. He raised His hands, and with a loud voice said. \"It is done.\" And all the angelic host laid off their crowns as Jesus made the solemn declaration, \"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.\" Revelation 22:11.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 402}
