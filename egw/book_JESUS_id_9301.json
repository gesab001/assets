{"word": "I know that in many hearts the inquiry arises, \"Where shall I find Jesus?\" There are many who want His presence, want His love and His light; but they know not where to look for Him for whom their hearts yearn. And yet Jesus does not hide Himself away; no one need search for Him in vain. \"Behold,\" He says, \"I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\" Revelation 3:20. Jesus invites us to accept His presence; we are to open the door of the heart, and let Him in. But He will not share a divided heart. If it be given to the service of mammon, if selfishness and pride fill its chambers, there will be no room for the heavenly Guest; He will not take up His abode with us until the soul-temple has been emptied and cleansed. Yet there is no need of making a failure in the Christian life. Jesus is waiting to do a great work for us, and all heaven is interested in our salvation.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 55}
