    "word": "The warning which we bear to the world must prove to them a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. And will the Lord send forth His servants to proclaim this fearfully solemn message and withhold from them His Holy Spirit? Shall frail, erring men, without special grace and power from God, dare to stand between the living and the dead to speak the words of everlasting life?

He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than are parents to give \n                                                                           158\ngood gifts to their children. The reason why the precious, important truth for this time is not powerful to save is that we do not work in faith.",
