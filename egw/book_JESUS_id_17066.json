{"word": "The living oracles of God, \"It is written,\" are the leaves of the tree of life, which human beings are to eat in order to gain spiritual life. As we eat the words of the Lord Jesus Christ, they become unto us eternal life. \"The words that I speak unto you,\" He said, \"they are spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:63). The restoring, vital current from Christ heals the wounds that sin has made. \n     \"What a friend we have in Jesus, \n     All our sins and griefs to bear; \n     What a privilege to carry \n     Everything to God in prayer.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 12}
