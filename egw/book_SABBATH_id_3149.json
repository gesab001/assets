{"word": "I saw all that \"would not receive the mark of the Beast, and of his Image, in their foreheads or in their hands,\" could not buy or sell. [Revelation 13:15-17.] I saw that the number (666) of the Image Beast was made up; [Revelation 13:18.] and that it was the Beast that changed the Sabbath, and the Image Beast had followed on after, and kept the Pope's, and not God's Sabbath. And all we were required to do, was to give up God's Sabbath, and keep the Pope's, and then we should have the mark of the Beast, and of his image.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "WLF", "page": 19}
