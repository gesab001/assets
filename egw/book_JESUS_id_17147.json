He is our Alpha and our Omega. Pressing close to His side and holding communion with Him, we become like Him. Through the transforming power of the Spirit of Christ, we are changed in heart and life. His words are engraven on the tablets of the soul, and we are His witnesses, representing Him in the daily life.--Letter 47, March 28, 1903, to F. C. Gilbert, a Jewish minister working for his own people.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 96}
