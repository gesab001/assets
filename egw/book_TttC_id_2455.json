    "word": "But few have a true sense of what is comprised in the word Christian. It is to be Christlike, to do others good, to be divested of all selfishness, and to have our lives marked with acts of disinterested benevolence. Our Redeemer throws souls into the arms of the church, for them to care for unselfishly and train for heaven, and thus be co-workers with Him. But the church too often thrusts them away, upon the devil's battlefield. One member will say, \"It is not my duty,\" and then bring up some trifling excuse. \"Well,\" says another, \"neither is it my duty;\" and finally it is nobody's duty, and the soul is left uncared for to perish. It is the duty of every Christian to engage in this self-denying, self-sacrificing enterprise. Cannot God return into their granaries and increase their flocks, so that instead of loss there shall be increase? \"There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\"",
