    "word": "Chapter 16 \n\n     31. Jezebel Versus the Spirit of God.--How few realize the power of an unconsecrated woman. I was carried back to the time of Ahab. God would have been with Ahab if he had walked in the counsel of heaven. But Ahab did not do this. He married a woman given to idolatry. Jezebel had more power over the king than God had. She led him into idolatry, and with him the people (MS 29, 1911).",
