    "word": "\"The Lord throws his royal banner of love about this His servant. He has not divorced him from His work. Even when he let go the only hand that could sustain him, God would not allow him to pass into the hands of Satan. He would not allow the enemy to triumph. He snatched the brand from the fire; for He would use it as a light to shine amid the moral darkness. This man is a brand years ago plucked from the fire by a miracle of grace.\"",
