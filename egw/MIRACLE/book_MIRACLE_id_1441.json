    "word": "God, a Person, Not the Things of Nature.--The whole of the natural world bears testimony to the works of the living God. Nature is our lesson book, given to us by God, the Creator of all things. These things of nature are not to be called God. They are the expression of God's character, but they are not God. By the things of His creation, we may understand God, and His love, His power, and His glory; but there is a great danger of men worshiping nature as God. The artistic skill of human beings produces very fine samples of beautiful workmanship, revealing things which delight the eye, and these things give us something of the idea of the designer; but the thing made is not the man. It is not the work that is to be exalted, but the man who designed the things so much prized. So it is with nature. The Lord's power is constantly revealed as a miracle-working power, that the human family may see an infinity above and beyond the things made, that they may know that He [who] formed such a being as man, has also created all the beauties of the natural world.--Ms 117, 1898. \n\n\n                                     -328-",
