    "word": "The time will come, Christ tells us of, when many deceivers will go forth, declaring themselves to be Christ. The Saviour says, \"Go ye not after them\". We need not be deceived. Wonderful scenes, with which Satan will be closely connected, will soon take place. God's Word declares that Satan will work \n\n\n                                 -7- \n\nmiracles. He will make people sick, and then will suddenly remove from them his Satanic power. They will then be regarded as healed. These works of apparent healing will bring Seventh-day Adventists to the test. Many who have had great light will fail to walk in the light, because they have not become one with Christ.",
