    "word": "I was shown that my husband has had three-fold the care he should have had. He has felt tried that brethren Andrews and Waggoner did not help him bear his responsibilities, and has felt grieved because they did not help him in the business matters in connection with the Institute and Association. There has been a continual advance of the work of publication since the unfaithful have been separated from it. As the work increased, there should have been men to have shared the responsibilities; but some who could do this had no desire, because it would not increase their possessions as much as some more lucrative business. There is not that talent in our Office that there should be. The work demands the most choice and select persons to engage in it. With the present state of things in the Office, my husband will still feel the pressure that he has felt, but \n                                                                           107\nwhich he should no longer bear. And it is only by a miracle of God's mercy that he has stood under the burden so long. But there are now many things to be considered. He has by his devotion to the work, and persevering care, shown what may be done in the publishing department. Men with unselfish interests combined with sanctified judgment, may take the work at the Office a success. My husband has so long borne the burden alone that it has told fearfully upon his strength, and there is a positive necessity for a change. He must be relieved from care to a great degree, and yet he can work in the cause of God in speaking and writing.",
