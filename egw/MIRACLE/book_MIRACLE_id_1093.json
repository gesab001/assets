    "word": "If you, my dear brother, are saved, it will indeed be a miracle of mercy. The love of the world is increasing upon you.

And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\" My brother, you have obeyed neither the first nor the second of these commandments.

You look to your own selfish interest, and say: \"Am I my brother's keeper?\"",
