    "word": "There might have been questioning among the multitude how they might entertain their benefactor and His disciples; for many of the people were rich, and they knew that Christ and His disciples were poor.

Having fed their souls with the precious word, the Bread of Life, He supplied their temporal (324) necessities, and thus encourages a manifestation of the grace of thankfulness.",
