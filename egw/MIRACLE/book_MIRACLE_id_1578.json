    "word": "Every time a soul is converted a miracle is wrought by the Holy Spirit of God, and for this we should give God continual praise. The promise of God is fulfilled when He says, \"A new heart also will I give thee.\" A new song is put in the mouth of the repentant sinner, and he proclaims the way of salvation to those around him. In the meetings that were held while we were in Melbourne, the Spirit of the Lord was manifested, and many excellent testimonies were borne by those who had experienced the converting power of God.",
