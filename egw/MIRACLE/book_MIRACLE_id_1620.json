    "word": "The great Medical Missionary was a wonderful Healer. He worked the most convincing miracles. He is the way, the truth, and the life. He spoke only the truth. Continually there fell from His lips the precious words that bring spiritual strength to those who make them a part of the daily life. Spiritually we are built up from the food that we give the mind. It is our privilege to receive the bread of life from the great medical missionary, who came to give life to the world. Truth, pure, refining, ennobling truth, came from His very heart. He spoke words of heavenly wisdom, which will make men wise unto salvation. His heart was constantly burning with love that brought Him from heaven to our world. His goodness and His power enabled Him to reveal in His life the truth that He came to this earth to bring to the fallen race. In every word, in every act, He manifested the love of God, cheering and encouraging the downcast and distressed. In heavenly wisdom He asserted His true majesty by bending all things to the present and future of human beings. He came to teach men and women how to live here below the life of which He gave them an example,--the life that will make them fit to enter the abodes of bliss.",
