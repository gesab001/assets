It involved a cross to give up their errors and receive changeless, eternal truth, therefore they would not admit the most conclusive evidence that God could give to establish faith in Christ. They were afraid of being convinced, lest they should be \n\n\n                                   -130- \n\nconverted and be compelled to yield up their preconceived opinions. They professed to believe the Old Testament Scriptures, yet the testimony of the Scriptures regarding Christ's life and character, they refused to believe. The treasure of the gospel of truth, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, was among them, but because of their perverted religious theories they would not receive the greatest Gift that heaven could bestow.",
