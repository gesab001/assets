    "word": "Every working of Christ in miracles was essential, and to reveal to the world that there was a great work to be done on the Sabbath day for the relief of suffering humanity, but common work was not to be done. Pleasure-seeking, ball-playing, swimming was not a necessity, but a sinful neglect of the sacred day sanctified by Jehovah. Christ did not perform miracles to display His power, but always to meet Satan [who was] afflicting suffering humanity. Christ came to our world to meet the needs of the suffering, whom Satan was torturing.",
