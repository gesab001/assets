    "word": "Some have come to me claiming to be Christ, and have apparently worked miracles. They have said that the Lord led me in many things, but the Sabbath was not a test question; that the law of God was not binding upon men; all we had to do was to accept Christ, and they themselves were Christ. I have had experience with all these pretentious claims, and I have no faith in them. \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them\" (Isaiah 8:20).",
