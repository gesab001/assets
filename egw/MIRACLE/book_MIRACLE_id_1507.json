    "word": "There is only one more family at Castle Hill that keeps the Sabbath, and they meet together occasionally. They and their horses work hard all week, and they do not feel that it is right-to drive thirteen miles on the Sabbath in order to meet with the church at Paremata, or to go nine miles to Kellyville. They have not been visited, and they are under discouragement. We talked and prayed with them, and the blessing of the Lord rested upon us. Brother L's wife is a feeble woman, a consumptive. They have a nice, helpful family of children. The eldest boy is nearly fifteen; the eldest girl is eleven, and she acts like a little woman, bearing responsibilities to save her mother, who cannot live long unless the Lord works a miracle in her behalf.",
