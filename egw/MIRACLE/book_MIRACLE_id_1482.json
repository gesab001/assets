    "word": "The miracles Christ performed were the manifestation of divine power to testify to the authority of the work and mission of Christ. This was something in God's arrangement to sweep away their prejudice and inspire faith. Did it do this? No. They had entrenched themselves in impregnable walls, forming a confederacy which they would not yield. The appeals made for them to believe, and the exhortations to repentance, were met with \"Show us a miracle.\" When Christ and the apostles presented convincing arguments of truth, the Jews would not hear; they would not receive the truth. They clamored for signs and miracles. This was not that they might obtain clearer views of the truth, but to divert the minds of the hearers from the clearest evidences of truth which had been presented. The Saviour had performed many miracles before them, but these were no longer the medium of convincing them of truth. If they could not turn the minds of the hearers away [by other means] they would say, \"He works these remarkable signs through Beelzebub, the prince of devils.\" \n\n\n                                    -183-",
