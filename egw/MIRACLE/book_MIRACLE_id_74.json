    "word": "The centurion felt his unworthiness. He was a man of contrite spirit although he was a man of authority. He felt unworthy to have Jesus Christ, with His miracle-working power, come under his roof, but His word spoken would be all that was essential, just as the centurion could say to his soldiers under him, \u201cGo, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\u201d He had confidence in the merely spoken words of Christ to restore his servant. When Jesus heard it, He marveled. \u201cVerily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\u201d. . .",
