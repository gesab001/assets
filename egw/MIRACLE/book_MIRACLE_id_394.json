THIS OTHER BEAST MUST THEREFORE BE A PERSECUTING POWER ALSO; AND THIS IS SHOWN IN THAT \u201cIT SPAKE AS A DRAGON.\u201d THE PAPACY RECEIVED ALL ITS POWER FROM SATAN, AND THE TWO-HORNED BEAST EXERCISES THE SAME POWER; IT ALSO BECOMES THE DIRECT AGENT OF SATAN. AND ITS SATANIC CHARACTER IS FURTHER SHOWN IN THAT IT ENFORCES THE WORSHIP OF THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST, BY MEANS OF FALSE MIRACLES. \u201cHE DOETH GREAT WONDERS, SO THAT HE MAKETH FIRE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN ON THE EARTH IN THE SIGHT OF MEN, AND DECEIVETH THEM THAT DWELL ON THE EARTH BY THE MEANS OF THOSE MIRACLES WHICH HE HAD POWER TO DO.\u201d",
