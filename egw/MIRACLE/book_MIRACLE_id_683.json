    "word": "Christ Did Not Parley With Temptation \n\n\n     Jesus did not condescend to explain to His enemy how He was the Son of God, and in what manner, as such, He was to act. In an insulting, taunting manner Satan \n                                                                           276\nreferred to the present weakness and the unfavorable appearance of Christ in contrast with his own strength and glory. He taunted Christ that He was a poor representative of the angels, much more of their exalted Commander, the acknowledged King in the royal courts. His present appearance indicated that He was forsaken of God and man. He said if Christ was indeed the Son of God, the monarch of heaven, He had power equal with God, and He could give him evidence by working a miracle and changing the stone just at His feet into bread, and relieve His hunger. Satan promised that, if Christ would do this, he would at once yield his claims of superiority, and that the contest between himself and Christ should there be forever ended.",
