Every one who teaches the truth for this time is to preach the word. Those who cling to the word, will not throw open the doors for Satan by making unguarded statements in reference to prophesying or to dreams and visions. To a greater or lesser degree false manifestations have been coming in, here and there, since 1844, after the time when we looked for the second coming of Christ.
