    "word": "God would have those in responsible positions show tact, skill, and wise generalship in detecting, seizing upon, and putting talent to use. He will not work miracles to advance the truth, without human agents cooperating. He has material in men and women, and he wants the generals in his army to have intelligence to bring it out and act their part to put it to use, not be constantly studying how to bind about the work, so that it shall not branch out and create a demand for more means. Set men to work under those who have some knowledge of the work, and who can educate them. Thrust the workers out into the harvest field. All that they want is encouragement.",
