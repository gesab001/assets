God had given Peter and John a message to give to the people, and it was their [the people's] privilege to accept, but they would not. We can see by the position taken by these professed people of God that they were arrayed \n\n\n                                    -265- \n\nagainst the truth. They said, \"What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus\" [verses 16, 17]. But the apostles Peter and John had a truth to present and they would not be stilled by these wicked counsellors. They \"answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye\" [verse 19].",
