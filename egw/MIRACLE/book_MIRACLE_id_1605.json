    "word": "The woman of Samaria who came and listened to Christ--she accepted Him without miracles at all, because she believed His word. She was glad for the light and went and published it to her neighbors. Here were the very ones who were hated of the Jews. The Samaritans were receiving the light. When Christ came to the Jews with all the power of His majesty, all His grace manifested in mighty healings and in the mighty out-pouring of His Spirit, they would not recognize that. Well, why? Because the very same prejudices that had been in their hearts reigned there, and the most mighty miracles that He could do would have no effect on their hearts at all.",
