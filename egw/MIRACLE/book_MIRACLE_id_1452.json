    "word": "Day by day the human structure performs its work under the great Master Architect, who superintends every function of the body, seeking to make it into a glorious temple for Himself. This is beyond the comprehension of any physician unless he has a knowledge of God, the great Master-Builder. If he does not seek to know God, and to become intelligent in regard to His constant and ceaseless miracle-working power, he will abuse God's building. When God works so wondrously, man, the human agent, should become intelligent in regard to the machinery of his body, that this temple of God shall not be misused, and become the habitation of devils, the hold of every foul spirit, \n\n\n                                        -365- \n\nand the cage of every unclean and hateful bird. But thousands upon thousands are ignorant of the house they live in. David exclaims, \"I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\" Then let us consider this matter carefully, exercising self-denial and temperance in all things.\"--Letter 17, 1895, pp. 7, 8.
