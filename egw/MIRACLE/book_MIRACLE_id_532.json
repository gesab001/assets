    "word": "Habits of Regularity Important \n\n     All physicians should place themselves under the control of the Great Physician. Under His guidance they will do as they should do. But the Lord will not work a miracle to save physicians who recklessly abuse His building. As far as possible, physicians should observe regularity in their habits of eating. They should take a proper amount of exercise. They should be determined to cooperate with the great Master Worker. God works, and man must come into line and work with Him; for He is the Saviour of the body.",
