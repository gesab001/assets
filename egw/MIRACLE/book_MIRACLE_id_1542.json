    "word": "Has the truth been lodged in your hearts? Is the miracle-working power of the grace of God seen in your lives? Do you understand, by personal experience, the joy of heavenly peace, and the power of Christ's gentleness? Christ's commandment is, \"Love one another, as I have loved you.\" Wherever the love of Jesus reigns, there is peace and rest. Where this love is cherished, it is as a refreshing stream in a desert, transforming barrenness into fertility.--Ms 105, 1902, pp. 8-10. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 6, 1987.",
