    "word": "Jesus made the lowly paths of human life sacred by His example. For thirty years he was an inhabitant of Nazareth. His life was one of diligent industry. He, the Majesty of heaven, walked the streets, clad in the simple garb of a common laborer. He toiled up and down the mountain steeps, going to and from His humble work. Angels were not sent to bear Him on their pinions up the tiresome ascents, or to lend their strength in performing His lowly task. Yet when He went forth to contribute to the support of the family by His daily toil, He possessed the same power as when He wrought the miracle of feeding the five thousand hungry souls on the shore of Galilee.\u2014HR Oct. 1, 1876.",
