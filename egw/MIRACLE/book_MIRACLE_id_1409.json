He was indeed in possession of talents of no ordinary character. He had heard the teaching of Jesus, and his mind had been aroused by the wonderful works. He desired to hear more, but he would not go to Jesus by day; he was not prepared to meet the jealousy of the scribes and Pharisees; and it would be too humiliating for a ruler of the Jews to acknowledge himself in sympathy with the despised Nazarene. He sought him at night, thinking, I will ascertain for myself the mission and claims of this teacher, and see whether he in indeed the Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Israel. \"Rabbi,\" he said to Jesus, \"we know that thou art a teacher come from God: \n\n\n                      -44- \n\nfor no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.\"",
