    "word": "The Bible, Not Miracles, Is the Foundation of Our Faith \n\n     Unless we stand on the elevated platform of eternal truth, we shall be swept away by the tide of delusive error that is sweeping over the world. Satan is coming down with great power to work miracles, and unless we are abiding in Christ, we shall be deceived. God's people are not the only ones who will have miracle-working power in the last days. Satan and his agencies will work \"with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.\"",
