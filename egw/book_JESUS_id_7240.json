{"word": "In order to understand the value which God places upon man, we need to comprehend the plan of redemption, the costly sacrifice which our Saviour made to save the human race from eternal ruin. Jesus died to regain possession of the one pearl of great price. . . . The life of God's children is a life of self-denial, of self-sacrifice, a life of humility. Those who are not partakers of His sufferings cannot hope to share in His glory. . . . We are to be judged according to the manner in which we use the knowledge of the truth which has been presented to us.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 48}
