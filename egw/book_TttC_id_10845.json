    "word": "Every line of God's work has a connection with every other line. Exclusiveness cannot exist in an institution where God presides; for He is the Lord of all tact, all ingenuity; He is the foundation of all correct methods. It is He who imparts knowledge concerning them, and no man is to look upon this knowledge as exclusively his own.",
