    "word": "Inspection by General Conference Auditor \n\n     The light given me by the Lord is that wise men, men of financial ability, should visit our schools in every country and keep an account of their financial standing. This matter should not be left to ministers or committee-men, who have no time to take this burden. The teachers are not to be left with this responsibility. These matters of school business call for talent which has not been provided.",
