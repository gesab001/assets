{"word": "Let all who are connected with the institution as helpers bear in mind the words of Inspiration: \"The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\" When you pass by one who is in need of your sympathy, of your kindly acts, and give them not, but turn to the forward ones and bestow upon them your favors, remember that Jesus is insulted in the person of His afflicted ones. He says, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink: I was . . . naked, and ye clothed Me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited Me not.\" And when the surprised inquiry comes, When saw we Thee thus? the answer, \"Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these [who were afflicted and needed your sympathy], ye did it not to Me.\" \"They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.\" They that are rich need not your favors, but they that are poor. The bruised and wounded, the lame of the flock, are among us, and these test the character of those who claim to be children of God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 146}
