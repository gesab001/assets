{"word": "Study Circumstances Carefully.--When a minister is appointed to a certain work, he is not to consider that he must ask the president of the conference how many days he shall labor in a certain locality, but he must seek wisdom from One who has appointed him his work, One who promised to give wisdom and unerring judgment, who giveth liberally and upbraideth not. He must carefully consider every part of the vineyard apportioned to him, and discern by the grace given what he shall do and what he shall not do. Circumstances will arise, which, if carefully studied, with humility and faith, seeking wisdom of God, will make you a wise and successful laborer.--Letter 8, 1895.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 327}
