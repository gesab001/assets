    "word": "Our old, hard-riding carriage had been well-nigh killing us and our team. Long journeyings with it, the labor of meetings, home cares and labors, were too much for us, and I feared that my work was done. My husband tried to encourage me and urged me to start out again to fill our appointments at Orange, Greenbush, and Ithaca. Finally I resolved to start, and, if I was no worse, continue the journey. I rode ten miles kneeling in the carriage on a cushion and leaning my head upon another in my husband's lap. He drove and supported me. The next morning I was some better and decided to go on. God helped us to speak in power to the people at Orange, and a glorious work was done for backsliders and sinners. At Greenbush I had freedom and strength given me. \n                                                                           600\nAt Ithaca the Lord helped us to speak to a large congregation whom we had never met before.",
