{"word": "Although the language of Christ was simple, the most educated were charmed with His manner of teaching, and the uneducated were always profited by His discourses. He used illustrations gathered from the customs and experiences of daily life, and whenever His hearers looked upon the familiar things of nature, the words of Christ were recalled to the mind. He drew illustrations from the birds of the air, the lilies of the field, from the shepherds of the flock, and various things of common occurrence in daily life. Thus were the lessons of Jesus made simple for the comprehension of the people. Instruction of the greatest importance was bound up in the smallest compass, and was so clearly stated that no one needed to misunderstand. The scribes and the Pharisees alone complained of finding it difficult to understand His teachings; but the reason of this was that they were filled with prejudice, and were determined to misconstrue His words. The common people heard Him gladly, for to the poor the gospel was preached, and many bore testimony to the fact that \"never man spake like this man.\"--SSW Jan. 1, 1895.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 194}
