{"word": "60\n     Christ has made it possible for you to be received as a member of the royal family, a child of the heavenly King. The Saviour will receive you as you come to Him, and will give you power to overcome. He declares \\93This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\\94 Will you not appreciate this great gift of life, eternal life in the kingdom of God? Read in the Scriptures of the advantages offered to those who live for Christ, and you will see that those who live for self will at last lose all. Do not allow the world to engross your thoughts. Take your position on the side of Christ. Be willing to share the trials and disappointments and self-denials that came to Him in the life that He lived for us on this earth. \\97Letter 226, 1903.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 60}
