    "word": "We met your influence at -----. The division existing there would not have been had you taken a right position, and received the word of the Lord through His servants. But this you would not do. God's servants had to deal plainly with your wrong course. Had they taken stronger ground, and been much more severe with the course you had pursued, God would have approved them. It would have been better had you remained entirely away from -----, for every time God's servants exposed that fanaticism, the reproof hit Brother G, and you shrank, felt abused, neglected, etc. You pursued your blind course among different families in -----; you labored for sympathy, and created opposition of feeling against Brethren C, D, and E. You felt wrong, felt slighted; you talked and acted out your feelings, and thus created jealousy and distrust in many minds in regard to God's servants whom He had especially sent to you. Your course destroyed the force of their testimony on some minds; but \n                                                                           319\nsome felt thankful that light had come, and that Satan's snare was broken, and they had escaped. Others felt hard, and decided against the testimony borne, and there was a division in the body. You can take the responsibility of this. We have had to labor for the church in ----- with distress of spirit to do away the wrong influence and impressions you had created. You have a work to do there.",
