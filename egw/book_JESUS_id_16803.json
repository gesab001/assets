{"word": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ works upon the heart and mind as an educator. The continued influence of His Spirit upon the soul trains and molds and fashions the character after the divine model. Let the youth bear in mind that a repetition of acts, forms habits, and habit, character. . . . Is the love of Christ a living, active agent in your soul, correcting, reforming, refining you, and purifying you from your wrong practices? There is need of cultivating every grace that Jesus through His suffering and death has brought within your reach. You are to manifest the grace that has been so richly provided for you, in the small as well as in the large concerns of life. . . . Great truths can be brought into little things, and religion can be carried into the little as well as into the large concerns of life.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 157}
