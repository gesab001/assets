{"word": "\"MOTHER HAS NEVER CLAIMED TO BE AUTHORITY ON HISTORY. THE THINGS WHICH SHE HAS WRITTEN OUT, ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF FLASHLIGHT PICTURES AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS GIVEN HER REGARDING THE ACTIONS OF MEN, AND THE INFLUENCE OF THESE ACTIONS UPON THE WORK OF GOD FOR THE SALVATION OF MEN, WITH VIEWS OF PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE HISTORY IN ITS RELATION TO THIS WORK. IN CONNECTION WITH THE WRITING OUT OF THESE VIEWS, SHE HAS MADE USE OF GOOD AND CLEAR HISTORICAL STATEMENTS TO HELP MAKE PLAIN TO THE READER THE THINGS WHICH SHE IS ENDEAVORING TO PRESENT. WHEN I WAS A MERE BOY, I HEARD HER READ D'AUBIGNE'S HISTORY OF THE REFORMATION TO MY FATHER. SHE READ TO HIM A LARGE PART, IF NOT THE WHOLE, OF THE FIVE VOLUMES. SHE HAS READ OTHER HISTORIES OF THE REFORMATION. THIS HAS HELPED HER TO LOCATE AND DESCRIBE MANY OF THE EVENTS AND THE MOVEMENTS PRESENTED TO HER IN VISION. THIS IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE STUDY OF THE BIBLE HELPS HER TO LOCATE AND DESCRIBE THE MANY FIGURATIVE REPRESENTATIONS GIVEN TO HER REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT CONTROVERSY IN OUR DAY BETWEEN TRUTH AND ERROR.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 437}
