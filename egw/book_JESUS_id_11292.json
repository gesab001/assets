{"word": "R. MACKIN: SATAN WANTS TO HINDER THIS WORK. WE ARE SEALED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT OF PROMISE. I PRESENT IT FROM EARLY WRITINGS WHEN THE ANGELS ARE ABOUT TO LOOSE THE FOUR WINDS, JESUS GAZES IN PITY ON THE REMNANT, AND WITH UPLIFTED HANDS CRIES, \"MY BLOOD, FATHER, MY BLOOD, MY BLOOD, MY BLOOD!\" HE REPEATS IT FOUR TIMES; FOR HIS PEOPLE ARE STILL UNSEALED. HE COMMISSIONS AN ANGEL TO FLY SWIFTLY TO THE FOUR ANGELS HOLDING THE FOUR WINDS, WITH THE MESSAGE, \"HOLD! HOLD! HOLD! HOLD! UNTIL THE SERVANTS OF GOD ARE SEALED IN THEIR FOREHEADS.\" AND AS I BRING THESE THINGS BEFORE THE CONGREGATION IT IS THE MOST EARNEST AND DEVOTED ONES THAT IT SEEMS TO AFFECT, MOSTLY.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 370}
