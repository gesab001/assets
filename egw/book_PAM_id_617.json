The\n244\nground is purchased but there must be no debt on the place. Therefore we wait for the Lord to open the way. He will do this. His promise is as good as a deed.

When we receive money we will commence to build a humble house of worship.--17MR 126.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 243}
