We need to understand what part we shall individually be called upon to act in building up the cause of God in the earth, in vindicating God's holy law, and in lifting up the Saviour as 'the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.' John 1:29. We need to meet together and receive the divine touch, that we may understand our work in the home.

We need \n                                                                           82\nto understand in regard to the division of labor and how each part of the work is to be carried forward. Each one should understand the part he is to act, that there may be harmony of plan and of labor in the combined work of all.\"--Pages 32, 33.",
