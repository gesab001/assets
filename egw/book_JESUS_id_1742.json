{"word": "Ye Are Bought With a Price\nThe lower passions have their seat in the body and work through it. The words \"flesh\" or \"fleshly\" or \"carnal lusts\" embrace the lower, corrupt nature; the flesh of itself cannot act contrary to the will of God. We are commanded to crucify the flesh, with the affections and lusts. How shall we do it? Shall we inflict pain on the body? No; but put to death the temptation to sin. The corrupt thought is to be expelled. Every thought is to be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. All animal propensities are to be subjected to the higher powers of the soul. The love of God must reign supreme; Christ must occupy an undivided throne. Our bodies are to be regarded as His purchased possession. The members of the body are to become the instruments of righteousness.  AH 121-128182", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 137}
