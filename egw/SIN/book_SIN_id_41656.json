    "word": "Bless this people; bless this sanitarium; let the glory of God be revealed; let the light of heaven shine upon them here; and may prosperity attend the medical missionary work. We pray Thee to sanctify the people and those that shall come here. Thou, the mighty Healer, can help them. Thou canst save them, if they will give their hearts to Thee. We ask Thee to let Thy power and Thy blessing rest upon the people. Encircle them in the arms of Thy mercy, and love them freely. O my Saviour, who is like unto Thee? None, none that can save to the uttermost but Thee. We give ourselves to Thee this evening. Wash away our sins; cleanse us in the blood of the Lamb; and may we be present when the family shall assemble in the kingdom of God, and we become members of the royal family and children of the heavenly King; and then we shall strike the golden harp and fill all heaven with music and songs to the Lamb.",
