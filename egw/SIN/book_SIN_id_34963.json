    "word": "A Continual Reform Essential.--Reform, continual reform, must be kept before the people, and by our example we must enforce our teachings. True religion and the laws of health go hand in hand. It is impossible to work for the salvation of men and women without presenting to them the need of breaking away from sinful gratifications, which destroy the health, debase the soul, and prevent divine truth from impressing the mind. Men and women must be taught to take a careful review of every habit and practice, \n                                                                           128\nand at once put away those things that cause an unhealthy condition of the body, and thus cast a dark shadow over the mind.--Ibid., Nov. 12, 1901.",
