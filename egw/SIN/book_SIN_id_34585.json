    "word": "Courage, Cheer, and Hope--Talk of the goodness and love of Jesus. You and I have been granted the blessing of speech, which is a talent of great value. It is to be used in talking of those things which increase love for Jesus. Let us talk of His mercy, of the gracious words He spoke to encourage and comfort, to bring hope and joy and love to our hearts. . . . Let us brighten the remaining years of our lives with words that bring courage and cheer and hope. The enemy will cast his shadow between Christ and our souls. He will tempt us to talk in a doubting, faithless way. But when disagreeable thoughts seek for utterance, do not give expression to them. Talk faith. Talk of the grace of our Lord and Saviour, of His love and mercy, of the beauty of His character. Let it become natural for the lips to give utterance to precious, inspiring thoughts.--Lt 14, 1900.",
