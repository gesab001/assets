    "word": "Do not speak of trials and discouragements. Look away from these things to Christ. \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" [John 1:29]. You are the purchase of His blood. Do not disappoint the One who gave His life that you might be an overcomer. He was tempted on every point that you and I can be tempted on, and in order to resist He spent whole nights in prayer and communion with his Father. Christ did not leave this world until He had made it possible for every soul to live a life of perfect faith and obedience, to have a perfect character.",
