    "word": "If you have sinned in not rendering love and obedience to them, begin now to redeem the past. You cannot afford to take any other course; for it means to you the loss of eternal life.

O, confess your neglect of your parents, confess your indifference toward them, and your contempt of God's holy commandment. . . .",
