    "word": "The men who hold positions of trust in our institutions should be men who appreciate the love of God, who realize their own weakness, who remember their own mistakes and errors and feel too much humbled in consequence to think that God has given them a special duty to criticize and place themselves as far off as they can from their own fellowmen. This is Satan's inspiration. Shall we provoke the Lord to anger by our idolatrous sentiments and selfish up-building, so that He will leave us to follow on in our own supposed wisdom and self-sufficiency, till He proves us, and reveals the true character of our service? \"Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.\" The Lord \n\n\n                                   -163- \n\nis against all self-sufficiency. He cannot work with His people because they will not use His blessings aright, but glorify themselves.",
