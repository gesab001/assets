    "word": "Brethren, we cannot afford to lay a stumbling-block in the path of any soul simply because they think they must have matters arranged so and so. The Lord desires us to be consistent in everything. He desires us to follow the self-sacrificing example of Christ, and when we do that, His blessing rests upon us. When we go to various places and our brethren know that we have been tempted to ask for higher pay but that we have overcome this temptation, He will give us influence with the people. It is not the higher pay that brings success. Success comes through following in the footsteps of the Saviour, in self-denial and self-sacrifice. When we do this, the Lord pronounces His blessing upon us. He discerns the hidden motives, and when the work that is to be done is especially difficult and taxing, His grace will be sufficient for our every need.",
