    "word": "What should our Christian life and character be, since God has given us such wonderful light, illuminating the way to heaven! What constant zeal, what prayerful watchfulness, should mark our Christian course! Jesus says, \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\" But though the way is so strait, there is no need of despair if we listen to the voice of God, and obey him instead of our own unsanctified impulses. Christ has said, \"My grace is sufficient for thee.\" His strength is made perfect in weakness.",
