    "word": "The light which the Lord has been pleased to give me is that in the work of establishing the sanitarium, we should ask our people for donations and loans. All the donations possible are to be obtained, and then our brethren are to be asked to loan their money, without interest or at a low rate of interest. But we are not to borrow money from the banks, even though we are obliged to put up the building piece by piece. In this matter let us work with an eye single to the glory of God.--Ms. 42, 1900, p. 1. (\"Words of Instruction Regarding the Sanitarium at Wahroonga,\" July 23, 1900.)",
