    "word": "It is said that Wilberforce once took the great statesman Pitt to hear the celebrated Mr. Scott preach. The preacher's theme was the way by which a sinner can be saved, and it was presented with great plainness, fervor, and earnestness. At the close of the service Pitt was asked what he thought of the sermon. He replied, \"I did not know what he was aiming at.\" Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. The things of the Spirit, the preaching of the cross, are \"to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.\" \n\n\n                                   -233-",
