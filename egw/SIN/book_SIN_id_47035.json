    "word": "Ridicule and witticisms are poor arguments. Ridicule cheapens the mind of any one who engages in it, for it separates his soul from God. No confidence should be placed in the judgment of those who do this thing, no weight attached to their advice or resolutions. Caviling and criticism are not in God's order. They leave the soul without dew or grace, as dry as the hills of Gilboa. Accusing the workmen and the work of the ones whom God is using is accusing Jesus Christ in the person of His saints. Your comments when in or out of the council are of no special weight with God. That which you all need is to cultivate your religious faculties, that you may have correct discernment of religious things. There has been a decided failure with you to distinguish between the pure gold and the tinsel and gilded objects; between the substance and the shadow. \n                                                                           942",
