    "word": "\"He that forsaketh not all that he hath,\" says Jesus, \"cannot be my disciple.\" Whatever shall divert the affections from God, must be given up. Mammon is the idol of many. Its golden chain binds them to Satan. Reputation and worldly honor are worshiped by another class. The life of selfish ease and freedom from responsibility, is the idol of others. These are Satan's snares, set for unwary feet. But these slavish bands must be broken; the flesh must be crucified with the affections and lusts. We cannot be half the Lord's and half the world's. We are not God's people unless we are such entirely. \n                                                                           66\nEvery weight, every besetting sin, must be laid aside. God's watchmen will not cry, \"Peace, peace,\" when God has not spoken peace. The voice of the faithful watchmen will be heard: \"Go ye out from hence, touch not the unclean. Go ye out of the midst of her. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"",
