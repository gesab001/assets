    "word": "But grace does not come in to excuse the sinner in the continuance of sin. God's grace does not detract from the law, but establishes the law as changeless in its character. Here \"mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.\" Psalms 85:10. God looks upon His Son dying upon the cross and is satisfied, and Jesus is called \"the Lord our righteousness.\" Then let the sinner by faith appropriate the merits of the blood of a crucified Redeemer to his own case--\"the Lord my righteousness.\"--Ms 30, 1889, pp. 21, 22.
