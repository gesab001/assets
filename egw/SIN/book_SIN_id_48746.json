    "word": "All are capable of using their talents in God's service. God asks them only to do their best. Those who study the life of \n\n90. \n\nChrist and yoke up with Him, will not use the brain only, but will reason from cause to effect, and will use every part of the human machinery. The Lord designs that useful labor shall compose a part of every man's life.",
