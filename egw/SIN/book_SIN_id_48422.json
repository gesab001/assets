    "word": "I have been very clear in counselling my brethren not to demand large wages, for this is not the impelling motive that leads us to spend our energies in the work of soul-saving. We are not to let the wage question stand in the way of our responding to the call of duty, wherever our services may be required. The Lord can bring matters around so that a blessing will attach to our labors far exceeding any compensation we may or may not receive; and He will give to His servants words to speak that are of the highest consequence to perishing souls.",
