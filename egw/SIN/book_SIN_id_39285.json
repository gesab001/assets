    "word": "The Lord could create an abundance of means for the carrying forward of His work. He could furnish the means without asking His people to make any sacrifice. The gold and the silver is His. All that we possess, even our own souls and bodies, are His. But the Lord has never worked this way. You remember how, when the sanctuary was to be built in the wilderness, He called on all the people to make their free will offerings. And they all wanted a part in the blessing. They gave until the leaders could say, \"It is enough. \n                                                                           338\nBring no more offerings.\"",
