    "word": "MS.--50--'04 \n     I accepted the light on health reform as it came to me. It has been a great blessing to me. I have better health today, notwithstanding I am seventy-six years old, than I had in my younger days. I thank God for the principles of health reform, and if there are any here today who have back-slidden in this respect, I say to them that God calls upon them to be converted, and to take their position in accordance with the light He has given. In denying perverted appetite, you will place yourself where God can co-operate with you.",
