    "word": "The Jews despised the good that was proffered them in the time of Christ, and after long forbearance of God, the things that were for their peace were hidden from their eyes. That which if received would have been to them their greatest blessing became their stumbling block. Thus it is today among us. They thought that Christ's teaching was counteracting the influence of the old and only religion that had been from the beginning. After they had once rejected the light, their minds were blinded, and they thought Christ's teaching was a deception of the enemy.
