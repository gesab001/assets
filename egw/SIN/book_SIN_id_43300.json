    "word": "Arouse, parents, and be converted! Let the light of your sanctification shine forth in clear, distinct rays. The great day of salvation has come. Those who humble themselves, repent, confess their sins, and draw near to God, will find that God will draw near to them. Let us fear to continue in transgression. Everywhere let it be known that it is the Father's will that everyone who seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, shall have everlasting life.",
