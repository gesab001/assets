    "word": "In studying this problem let us remember that the Lord sees not as man sees. He looks upon the terrible neglect of the cities. I do not want to repeat what I have said about this neglect. It is not at all in the order of God that these cities should be left unwarned, unworked. It is the result of man's devising. There is a world to be saved.--Ms 53, 1909, pp 2, 3, 6, 8, 9. (\"Proclaiming the Third Angel's Message in Cities at Home and Abroad,\" June 11, 1909.)",
