    "word": "We are to stand always on guard, for the enemy is working with all deceivableness of unrighteousness. He has legions under his control, emissaries of evil, who cooperate with their leader for the deception and destruction of the human race. Satan is capable of exercising great subtlety, and while men sleep he is awake. Those who are off their guard are in great danger. It is not safe to be presumptuous, to ignore Satan's shrewdness, or to fail to have a correct estimate of the efforts that we must make if we escape being taken in his snare. It is a fact that many deceivers have gone out into the world, and unless we obey our Captain's orders, we shall be used by Satan to serve his purposes.",
