    "word": "The Example of Philip With Nathanael \n\n     The case of Philip and Nathanael is an example of true home missionary work. Philip had seen Jesus and was convinced that He was the Messiah. In his joy he wished his friends also to know the good news. He desired that the truth which had brought such comfort to him should be shared by Nathanael. True grace in the heart will always reveal its presence by diffusing itself. Philip went in search of Nathanael, and as he called, Nathanael answered from his place of prayer under the fig tree. Nathanael had not had the privilege of listening to the words of Jesus, but he was being drawn toward Him in spirit. He longed for light, and was at that moment sincerely praying for it. Philip with joy exclaimed: \"We have found Him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth.\" John 1:45. At Philip's invitation Nathanael sought and found the Saviour, and in his turn joined in the work of winning souls for Christ.",
