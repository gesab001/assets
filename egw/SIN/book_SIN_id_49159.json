    "word": "The work among the colored people in the Southern field, with its encouraging and discouraging features, has been kept before me for many years. While in Australia, I earnestly called upon my brethren and sisters in America to awake to the responsibility resting upon them to carry the third angel\u2019s message to this neglected race.

I have an intense interest in all that concerns the welfare of the work among the colored people.",
