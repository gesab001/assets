    "word": "Do good if you would be cherished in the memory of others. Live to be a blessing to all, wherever your lot may be cast. There are so many thousands who do no good in the world. None could point to them as the agency through Jesus Christ in the saving of their souls. . . . By kindness and love, by self-denying, self-sacrificing deeds, write your names in the hearts of many.--Letter 103, 1900, pp. 1-6. (To Dores Robinson, typed July 13, 1900.)",
