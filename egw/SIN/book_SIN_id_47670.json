    "word": "I shall try to place myself in the hands of the Lord moment by moment. I realize that the wisdom of man is foolishness; the wisdom of God is infallible. The final resurrection to judgment will complete on the one hand the triumph of Christ and his church, and on the other will be the destruction of Satan and his followers. Time will be the only sure revealer of God's plan. In every action God looks at the heart. No external arrangements in conformity with the world, to secure its friendship, can be made without positive danger of transgressing God's holy precepts. Pride and love of worldly praise lie at the foundation of all this self-exaltation and desire for recognition. These prompt a desire for outward show and an appearance of being linked with the friendship of the world. Self-righteousness which is so deceptive, is bound up with the unsanctified heart. The warning is given us, \"Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\" O that our physicians and ministers and church members may see this matter in its true bearing. O that they may exalt the Lord God, and let him be their fear and their dread.",
