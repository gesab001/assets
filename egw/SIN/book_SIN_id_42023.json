    "word": "I know that the Lord has helped you many, many times. I have the fullest confidence that He has made you a blessing to very many. May the Lord clothe you with His salvation. Walk in the light, press to the light, refuse to look at darkness or talk darkness. Talk of things that are calculate to uplift the soul; come close to Jesus, commune with Him. He will be your wisdom. He will preserve you still to do a good work for Him. Satan, you must know, will seek to hinder you in every possible way. He will delight to discourage you and shorten your life. I want your life spared; I do not want the devil to have his way. I want you to be a strong, well-balanced character because the grace of Christ is given you in large measure. I know it is your privilege to have the blessing of God daily, and you cannot fill your position unless you do have it. May you be of good courage in the Lord. Turn your attention from disagreeable things. By beholding you become changed. Talk of pleasant things, talk hope and courage, and you will have hope and courage.--Letter 46, 1887, pp. 4, 7. (To J. H. Kellogg, April 22, 1887.) \n\n\n                                      -303-",
