    "word": "Marian has been with me about twenty-five years. She was my chief worker in arranging the matter for my books. She ever appreciated the writings as sacred matter placed in her hands, and would often relate to me what comfort and blessing she received in performing this work, that it was her health and her life to do this work. She ever handled the matters placed in her hands as sacred. . . . I shall miss her so much. Who will fill her place?--Ms 146, 1904, pp. 1, 2. (\"Diary fragment,\" entry for October 9, 1904.)",
