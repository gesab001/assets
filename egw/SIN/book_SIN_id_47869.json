    "word": "In Africa as well as in America and Australia men have been quarried out of the world, not to be left as rough stones, but to be taken into the workshop of God, and placed under the axe and hammer and made ready for the heavenly polishing. The roughness has not yet been put away. Many are not yet subdued by the Spirit of God. Because of this, the work in America and Africa and other parts of the Lord's vineyard has not advanced as it should. We are doing what we can, according to the light given, for Australia. A direct necessity, is being met by the work of women who have given themselves to the Lord, and are reaching out to help a needy, sin-stricken world, who want the truth, but do not know that they want it. Personal evangelistic work is to be done. People are reached by house-to-house labor. The women who have taken up this work do everything but preach the gospel from the pulpit. They carry the gospel to the homes of the people in the highways and byways. They read and explain the word to families and individuals, praying with them, caring for the sick, relieving their temporal necessities, presenting before them the purifying, transforming influence of the truth. They show them that the way to find peace and happiness and joy is to follow Jesus.",
