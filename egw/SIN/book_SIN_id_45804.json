    "word": "There is something for every one of us to do to clear the King's highway. We want to confess and forsake our sins and have them go beforehand to [the] judgment [so] that when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord, and He shall send Jesus, our sins will be blotted out. What we want is pure and undefiled religion before God. We read in the Scriptures that pure and undefiled religion before God is this, That we visit the widow and fatherless in their affliction, and that we keep ourselves unspotted from the world.",
