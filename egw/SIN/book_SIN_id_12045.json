    "word": "Those who know not God cannot by their learning or science find out God. Christ does not try to prove the great mystery, but reveals a love that is beyond measurement. He does not make God's power and greatness the chief theme of His discourses. He speaks of Him oftenest as our Father. . . . He desires our minds, weakened by sin, to be encouraged to grasp the idea that God is love. . . .",
