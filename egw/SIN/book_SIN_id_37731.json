    "word": "Our Saviour often preferred the fields, the groves, and the lake-sides for his temples. People flocked to these places in great crowds to listen to the words of truth which fell from his divine lips. He had special reasons for choosing those natural sanctuaries; the familiar objects of nature were thus presented to the eyes of his hearers, and he used those objects to simplify his teachings, binding his truths firmly upon the minds of the people by the lessons drawn from nature to illustrate his meaning.",
