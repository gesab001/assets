    "word": "\"Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.\" Let us walk and work circumspectly. Let humble prayers go up to God, and let us seek Him with the whole heart. Then the Lord will open the way for us to lay wise plans. My brethren, speak to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, \"singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things unto the Lord.\"",
