    "word": "All who are partakers of the divine nature will realize that the Holy Spirit works with them, taking the truth from the sacred Word, where Christ has placed it, and stamping it upon the soul. But we are in great peril of keeping the truth in the outer court, neglecting to bring it into the sanctuary of the soul. Earnestly and solemnly we should prepare ourselves for the cleansing of the soul-temple, remembering that we are a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. This work, when thoroughly done, will cleanse the heart from all disunion, all strife, all desire for the supremacy.--Ms 14, 1901, pp. 1, 2, 21.
