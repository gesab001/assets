    "word": "We may rejoice in every condition of life, and triumph\n93\nunder all circumstances, because the Son of God came down from heaven and submitted to bear our infirmities, and to endure sacrifice and death in order to give to us immortal life. He will ever bear the marks of His earthly humiliation in man's behalf. While the redeemed host and the pure angelic throng shall do Him honor and worship Him, He will carry the marks of one that has been slain. The more fully we appreciate the infinite sacrifice made in our behalf by a sin-atoning Saviour, the more closely do we come into harmony with heaven.",
