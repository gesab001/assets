    "word": "That night the angel of the Lord stood by my side, and talked with me. He said that the church at Fresno would have to learn many things; that many were there that ought not to be there; that all must draw nearer to God, and find their strength in him, and not in man. They must use their own powers that God has given them, and let their light shine forth in good works. He said that they had placed man where God should be; but when they \n\n\n                            [2] \n\nshould make God alone their trust, then he would educate them, and lead them in safe paths. Then they would be light-bearers to the world, and would not walk in darkness. But now they were trusting in man to do the work for them which the Lord God of Israel alone could do. The Lord was working, signifying that he was their power and efficiency; and if they would work in harmony with him, talking to one another in faith and humility, dwelling on the lessons of Christ; if they would set things in order in the church, and let God speak to human hearts, then the Spirit of God would come into their midst, and a repentance would be seen that would not need to be repented of. But if they did not make the Lord their trust, the blessing they had received would be only their condemnation.",
