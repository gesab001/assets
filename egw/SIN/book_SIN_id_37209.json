And, as he tended the things of beauty and usefulness around him, he could behold the goodness and glory of God in his created works. Adam had themes for contemplation in the works of God in Eden, which was Heaven in miniature. God did \n                                                                           8\nnot form man merely to contemplate his glorious works; therefore, he gave him hands for labor, as well as a mind and heart for contemplation.
