    "word": "O what a fortress and high tower He is for us. I have been passing through great sorrow because some among those who . . . have evidence that the Lord has used the feeble agent to express great and everlasting truths, are turning from the living wells to hew out and drink at broken fountains. My soul is in agony night after night. I can sleep but a few hours; for the thought of those who are in false paths afflicts my soul.--Letter 80, Feb. 15, 1906, to F. M. Wilcox, manager of the Boulder, Colorado, Sanitarium and later editor of the Review and Herald.",
