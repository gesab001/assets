    "word": "Those who led out in the establishment and maintenance of institutions in the earlier history of our work, often met with trials and perplexities. The enemy was actively at work to undermine confidence, and to place obstructions in the way of progress. Had the brethren at such times submitted to discouragement, they would not only have brought weakness to the cause they loved, but would have lessened their own ability to advance. Their later experience would have been marred by the knowledge that they had begun a good work and had failed. But our brethren in responsibility did not falter in the face of difficulty. They moved forward in the name of the Lord God of Israel, determined never to give up. They had pledged themselves to make a success of the work that had been entrusted to them, and they labored on in faith until they gained decided victories. The untiring efforts of these faithful men have resulted, under the blessing of God, in increasing prosperity in all branches of the Lord's work.",
