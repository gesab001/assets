    "word": "Sister Starr and Emily were nearest the door, but they did not stop to open it; we all climbed over the closed door and tumbled out in good order without bruising an ankle, and were ever so thankful to be out of the fracas. After a time the horse stopped his kicking. My spring seat was placed on a rock by the wayside, and we all were with our satchels seated there half an hour. The horse and wagonette were taken back to the stable, and the owners \n\n\n                                    -81- \n\nwere reprimanded by Brother Starr for hitching up a horse that was too long for the shafts. Another horse and carriage were provided for us, and Brother Reekie picked us up by the roadside and we went to the depot for Willie. We met him just in time, and all went on board the boat, and stowed our baggage in our stateroom, and in the hold of the boat.--Ms 5, 1893, pp. 2, 3. (Diary, February 4, 1893.)",
