    "word": "\"Medical missionary work is the pioneer work of the gospel. Let us seek to understand the scope of the work to be done in our sanitariums for the saving of the souls and the healing of the bodies of those who come to us for relief. My soul is drawn out to encourage men and women to see in Christ the great Physician. If they will be drawn to Him, He will be their Helper. He understands their every need. He stands ready to heal both body and soul. Let physicians and nurses learn to tell of the One who has power and who is willing to do a marvelous work for human beings. Talk of His love; tell of His power to save every sinful soul who will cast himself upon Christ's merits. His power will save to the uttermost all who truly accept Him.",
