    "word": "My brother, I beseech of you to look away from yourself unto Christ, and live. Put your trust in the One who loves human agencies. Let your dependence be wholly on Christ. He is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto Him. Believe, believe that Christ will pardon all your transgressions and forgive all your sins. Humble yourself as a little child, and Christ will receive you and bless you and strengthen you. Do not think unbelief or talk unbelief, but take God at His word, and leave yourself in His hands, to be taught and led of Him. . . .",
