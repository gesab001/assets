    "word": "Our redemption was laid by a sacrifice, the most costly that Heaven could give. The Son of God was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich. He has made it our privilege to share in His self-denial and self-sacrifice for the salvation of men. When men spend their precious, probationary time in gratifying self, living for self-pleasing, refusing to cooperate in the Lord's beneficent designs for the world, what fellowship of communion can they have with Christ? Every one who partakes of the Spirit of Christ will unite with Him in His labor and sacrifice for the good of others.",
