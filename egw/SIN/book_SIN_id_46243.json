    "word": "1 John 5:1-5; 1:3-10.\n\n     Christ died for us to make an atonement for our sins. He is now standing at His Father's right hand, pleading for us. To all who receive Him. He will give power to become the sons of God. Had He not paid the redemption price for us, we could not be saved. But His intercessions prevail; He had power to take away your sins. He lives to make intercession and because He lives, we shall live also if we are obedient to His will. He will keep us from falling.",
