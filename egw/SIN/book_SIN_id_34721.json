    "word": "New Light, New Ideas--Some of our ministers have a runway of discourses which they use without variation year after year. The same illustrations, the same figures, and almost the same words. They have ceased to be students. There is an end to improvement, and they stagger under the load of a few set discourses to prevent mental decrepitude. But \n                                                                           324\nby the ever-learning student new light, new ideas, new gems of truth will be found and eagerly grasped. . . . The gospel is not properly taught and represented before unbelievers by men who have ceased to be students, who have, as it were, graduated as far as searching the Scriptures is concerned, and they bring a reproach upon the truth by the manner in which they handle it. If men obtain the ears of the people, the very best quality of preaching is needed, because pleasing fables are presented by eloquent lips.--Lt 33, 1886.",
