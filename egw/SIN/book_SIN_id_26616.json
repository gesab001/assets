    "word": "The Value of a Soul.--\"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek, He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.\" He is the only One that had power to do it. Here the great price has been paid for souls sunk in sin. Man must be of value. Christ weighs him. Christ's taking human nature upon Himself shows that He places a value upon every soul. \"What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" This is the value God places upon man, and again He says, \"I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\" But God will do nothing without the co-operation of the human agent.",
