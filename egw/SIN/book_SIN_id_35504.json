    "word": "\"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not\"--oh, how precious is that \"not\"!--\"I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels\" (Revelation 3:5). When the gates of the city of God swing back on their glittering hinges, and the nations who have kept the truth shall enter in, Christ will be there to welcome us, to call us the blessed of the Father, because we have overcome. He will welcome us before the Father, and before His angels. As we enter the kingdom of God, there to spend eternity, the trials and the difficulties and the perplexities that we have had here will sink into insignificance. Our life will measure with the life of God.--General Conference Bulletin, Apr. 6, 1903.",
