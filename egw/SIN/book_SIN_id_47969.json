    "word": "Whether you are believers or unbelievers, you are the Lord's property, bought with a price. You may ignore your relationship with God as His children. Whose children then are you? Children of the devil, and his deeds you are content to do. But all the influence you might have exercised by using your talents in behalf of truth, and by co-operating with God, all the improvements your talents would have made if put into actual service through the provisions made for you to cooperate with God, will be charged to your account. You stubbornly held yourself on Satan's side giving your influence to the great apostate; and all the good you might have done through the atoning sacrifice, but did not do, will be charged against you when you are weighed in the balances and found wanting. You had a work to do. A special stewardship was entrusted to you, but you would not accept the trust. Christ crucified was presented to you. The spirit of God pled with you. By being lifted up on the cross Christ sought to draw you to himself. But your stubborn will would not yield to his invitations. His appeals were resisted. You are stewards notwithstanding; but unfaithful, dishonorable stewards, burying your talents in the world, serving Satan in the place of serving the Lord. Impenitent sinner, what excuse will you give to God for your wasted opportunities.",
