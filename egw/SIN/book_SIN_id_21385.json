    "word": "My interest in the general work is still as deep as ever, and I greatly desire that the cause of present truth shall steadily advance in all parts of the world. But I find it advisable not to attempt much public work while my book work demands my supervision. I have some of the best workers--those who in the providence of God connected with me in Australia, with others who have united with me since my return to America. I thank the Lord for these helpers. We are all very busy, doing our best to prepare matter for publication. I want the light of truth to go to every place, that it may enlighten those now ignorant of the reasons of our faith. On some days my eyes trouble me, and I suffer considerable pain in them. But I praise the Lord that He preserves my sight. It would not be strange if at my age I could not use my eyes at all.",
