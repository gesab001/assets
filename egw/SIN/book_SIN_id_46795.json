    "word": "Brethren, you are urging me to come to your campmeetings. I must tell you plainly that the course pursued toward me and my work since the Gen. Conf. at Minneapolis--your resistance of the light and warnings that God has given through me--has made my labor fifty times harder than it would otherwise have been. I \n                                                                           660\nfind that my words have far less influence upon the minds of our people than upon unbelievers whose hearts have not been hardened by rejecting the light. I have no word from the Lord to labor for you in the camp meetings, to repeat to you, little by little, that which, at great cost and labor I have published for your benefit. As you feel no burden to obtain and circulate the books, I feel that my oral testimony would make no lasting impression. I have no courage to meet you in campmeeting. It seems to me that you have cast aside the word of the Lord as unworthy of your notice.",
