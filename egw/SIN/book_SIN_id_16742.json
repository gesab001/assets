    "word": "Nothing can do us real good without the blessing of God. What God blesses is blessed. Therefore \u201ca little that a righteous man hath is better that the riches of many wicked.\u201d Psalm 37:16. The little with the blessing of God is more efficient, and it will extend farther. The grace of God will make a little go a great ways. When we devote ourselves to the affairs of the kingdom of God, He will mind our affairs.\u201d",
