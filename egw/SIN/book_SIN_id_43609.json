    "word": "The buildings that in your pride you have erected do not glorify Me. The salvation of one soul is more to Me than costly mansions, than gold or silver. \n\n\n                                   -198- \n\nBut you have made an atom of a world, and a world of an atom. These buildings will soon perish, but they have not a living soul. The souls I have bought at an infinite price--the gift of My only begotten Son--you have failed to appreciate. Some have been treated with partiality and others with indifference, as though they were mere machines. Some have been driven away from Me, and led to despise Me, because of your insincerity and unjust dealing. These souls I will require at your hands. The riches of a world sink into insignificance when compared with the loss of a soul. And yet you have treated those who would not voice your man-made commandments, your human resolutions, as though they did not possess souls capable of living through the eternal ages.",
