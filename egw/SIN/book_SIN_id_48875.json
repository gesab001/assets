    "word": "Although Brother Hansen is an outspoken man, his children and all who associate with him can be so managed that there will be no need of roughness. All can be educators of themselves, placing themselves under God's discipline. Let their criticising propensities be exercised upon themselves; then no one will suppose that he must place himself on the judgment seat to condemn others.",
