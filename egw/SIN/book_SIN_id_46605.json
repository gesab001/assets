    "word": "We deplore the fact that men idolize their own opinions, that they are willing to be governed by their own preconceived ideas rather than by a plain \"Thus saith the Lord.\" It is \n                                                                           428\nthe most difficult thing in the world to convince men who do not want to be convinced. Satan beclouds the perceptions, and hardens the heart so that men will not give up their own ways that they may work for the salvation of a backslidden church, and point sinners to the \"Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Instead of engaging heartily in this work, they hold back, and almost hope and pray that those upon whom the Lord has laid the burden, will not succeed: for if success crowns the efforts of the burden-bearers, it will prove these doubters to be in the wrong.",
