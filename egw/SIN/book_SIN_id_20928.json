    "word": "As Christ ascends while in the act of blessing His disciples, an army of angels encircle Him as a cloud. Christ takes with Him the multitude of captives. He will Himself bring to the Father the first fruits of them that slept, as an evidence that He is conqueror of death and the grave. At the portals of the city of God, an innumerable company of angels await His coming. As they approach, the escorting angels address the company at the gate in triumphant tones:-- \n\n\n          \"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; \n           And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; \n           And the King of glory shall come in.\" \n\n\n     \"Who is this King of glory?\" the waiting angels inquire. \n\n\n          \"The Lord strong and mighty, \n           The Lord mighty in battle. \n           Lift up your heads, O ye gates; \n           Even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; \n           And the King of glory shall come in.\"",
