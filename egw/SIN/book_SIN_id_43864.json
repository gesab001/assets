    "word": "Achan thought it a very small matter to take the wedge of gold and the Babylonish garment--part of the spoil that the Lord had declared was to be utterly consumed. But what was to him a very small matter was in sight of the Lord a very serious matter. He had sinned against the Lord, and because of his sin the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel. The presence of the Lord was withdrawn from their armies; for God would not serve with sin. He permitted the enemy to triumph over them.",
