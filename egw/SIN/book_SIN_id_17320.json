    "word": "By Christ's wonderful union of divinity with humanity, we are assured that even in this world we may be partakers of the divine nature. . . . Christ has pledged Himself to cooperate with those to whom He has entrusted talents. He has pledged Himself to train us to be His co-laborers. He will help us to follow His example, doing good and refusing to do evil. We are to be consecrated channels through whom the love of Christ flows to those in need of help. . . .",
