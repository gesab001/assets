    "word": "August 20. I expected to complete and send this letter yesterday but did not do so. Several things came up. Sister Parmalee and Sister Marks called upon me and Sister Marks had a long talk in regard to things she said were said about her. She denied the verity of these things. I refused to become mixed up in them and she complained that Elder Van Horn had not treated her as a Christian gentleman, neither had Elder Webber. She said they did not ask her or come to ascertain facts but came to condemn her and she was abused by them. I can say but little and will not engage in this matter, and told them so. If the woman has been treated wrongfully, I am sorry. Since \n                                                                           691\nsome have treated me as they have done without the least occasion to do so I think they will do almost anything and they think they are doing God service. I shall be extremely careful that I am not found on the side of those who censure and condemn from hearsay lest I offend one of God's little ones, for Christ says it were better that a millstone were hanged about the neck of such an offender and that he be cast into the depths of the sea.",
