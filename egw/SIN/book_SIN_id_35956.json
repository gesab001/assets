    "word": "While the soul is filled with fear and terror, the mind can not see the tender compassion of Christ. Our sanitariums are to be an agency for bringing peace and rest to the troubled mind. If you can inspire the despondent with hopeful, saving faith, contentment and cheerfulness will take the place of discouragement and unrest. Wonderful changes will then be wrought in their physical condition. Christ will restore both body and soul, and, realizing His compassion and love, they will rest in Him. He is the bright and morning star, shining amid the moral darkness of this sinful, corrupt world. He is the light of the world, and all who give their hearts to Him will find peace and rest and joy.",
