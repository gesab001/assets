    "word": "Day after day, as they [Paul and Silas] went to their devotions [in Philippi], a woman with the spirit of divination followed them, crying, \u201cThese men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation.\u201d This woman was a special agent of Satan; and, as the devils were troubled by the presence of Christ, so the evil spirit which possessed her was ill at ease in the presence of the apostles. Satan knew that his kingdom was invaded, and took this way of opposing the work of the ministers of God. The words of recommendation uttered by this woman were an injury to the cause, distracting the minds of the people from the truths presented to them, and throwing disrepute upon the work by causing people to believe that the men who spoke with the Spirit and power of God were actuated by the same spirit as this emissary of Satan.",
