    "word": "God has adopted human nature in the person of His Son, and has carried the same into the highest heaven. It is the \u201cSon of man\u201d who shares the throne of the universe. It is the \u201cSon of man\u201d whose name shall be called, \u201cWonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\u201d Isaiah 9:6. The I AM is the Daysman between God and humanity, laying His hand upon both. He who is \u201choly, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,\u201d is not ashamed to call us brethren. Hebrews 7:26; 2:11.",
