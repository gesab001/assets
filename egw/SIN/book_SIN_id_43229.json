    "word": "Those who would be ensamples of self-denial, of cross bearing, of piety, of single-hearted devotion to God, will have to look well to their habits and their ways, lest by their works they contradict their faith and through their inconsistencies become a positive hindrance to others. They should constantly watch lest they lose confidence in themselves. When light and grace are imparted by the Lord, but not appreciated by those whom He would bless, they become self-indulgent, and please perverted appetite, and gratify passion. Moral force often resisted will finally lose its power to control, and self-respect is lost and confidence in God is shaken. The backslider hesitates to lay claim to the precious promises of the gospel, for he knows that every promise is fulfilled upon conditions, and that he has failed to meet the conditions. The Holy Spirit is grieved, and the rebellious one is left in the darkness that he has chosen.",
