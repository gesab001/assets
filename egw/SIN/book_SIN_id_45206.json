    "word": "In the last Bible Institute I paid the fare of some who wanted to attend the meetings, but were not able. I also boarded several in order that they might have the benefit of the meetings. I do not regret this. I know that such precious opportunities are beyond the estimate of gold and silver. Everyone who attended the meeting was constantly sitting at a banquet from heaven. I could not bear to think of anyone losing the precious things that were presented from the Word of God. This has to be acted over every meeting that is held.",
