    "word": "We would feel sad should anyone choose to pursue such a course, but it is the duty of the principal and teachers to demand perfect order and perfect discipline. Teachers are to blend in harmony in this matter. Those teachers who do not see the necessity of maintaining the rules that it is deemed essential to make, have simply made a mistake in thinking they were prepared to teach, and accepting the situation. One imprudent word or action from a teacher would counter-work the object or purpose of the school, and would also be injurious to their own present and eternal good; and the sooner such teachers resign the position of teacher and become learners, the better it will be for the future of the school. No experiments should be made in this matter, for it is too dangerous a business. He who attempts to teach should be connected with Christ, wearing His yoke of restraint himself, that he may be an example to the students.",
