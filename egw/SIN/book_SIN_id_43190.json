    "word": "Christ met the people where they were--at the guest table, in the streets, by the lakeside, in the synagogues and the temple, and on the crowded thoroughfares of travel. In these places were found the multitudes who were willing to admit that they were sinners. In their hearts Christ could sow the seeds of truth; and after His resurrection and ascension these seeds, scattered in almost every place, sprang up under the teaching of the apostles, and in one day 5,000 believers were converted.",
