    "word": "The sin that leads to the most unhappy results is the cold, critical, unforgiving spirit that characterizes Pharisaism. When the religious experience is devoid of love, Jesus is not there; the sunshine of His presence is not there. . . . There may be a wonderful keenness of perception to discover the defects of others; but to everyone who indulges this spirit, Jesus says, \"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye\" (Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 125, 126).",
