    "word": "Has not the Lord Jesus sent message after message of rebuke, of warning, of entreaty to these self-satisfied ones! Have not his counsels been despised and rejected? Have not his delegated messengers been treated with scorn, and their words been received as idle tales! Christ sees that which man does not see. He sees the sins which, if not repented of, will exhaust the patience of a long-suffering God. Christ cannot take up the names of those who are satisfied in their own self-sufficiency. He cannot importune in behalf of a people who feel no need of his help, who claim to know and possess everything.",
