    "word": "God chastens his people, with the hope of saving their souls. The defections among God's people are keenly felt by Him who died to ransom them from Satan's power. The church is burdened and saddened. A cloud hangs over her. Let every soul seek God, inquiring, \"Lord, is it I who have brought this discouragement upon thy people? Is it because of my perversity that Zion is burdened? Have I given occasion for our enemies to triumph--If so, Lord, have mercy upon thy sinful child, and save me for thy mercies' sake.",
