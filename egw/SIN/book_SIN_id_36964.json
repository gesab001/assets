    "word": "Our important institutions, which have had the very best of our lives in disinterested, unselfish labor, should respond to the labor which was bestowed when everything went so hard. Every new enterprise, every forward movement, met at first with opposition from our ministers and people; and these enterprises had to be carried through by the most taxing efforts at every step, to bring them into existence and keep them advancing with the opening providence of God. But the work has been helped forward by others as well as my husband; and he must not feel that he is deserving of all the credit.",
