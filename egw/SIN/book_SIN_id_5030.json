The eye of God takes \n                                                                           147\ncognizance of every farthing devoted to His cause, and of the willingness or reluctance of the giver. The motive in giving is also chronicled. Those self-sacrificing, consecrated ones who render back to God the things that are His, as He requires of them, will be rewarded according to their works. Even though the means thus consecrated be misapplied, so that it does not accomplish the object which the donor had in view,--the glory of God and the salvation of souls,-- those who made the sacrifice in sincerity of soul, with an eye single to the glory of God, will not lose their reward.--2T 518, 519.",
