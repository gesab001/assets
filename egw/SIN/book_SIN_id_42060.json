    "word": "To the astonishment of all heaven, the proclamation was made that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to a life of humiliation and suffering. By an amazing sacrifice the Son of the infinite God displayed His love for the fallen race. He did this as the only means of manifesting the love of God for disobedient human beings. He made an offering that could not possibly be exceeded in value. The love of God was manifested in and through Christ. The Son of God suffered the penalty of sin, reconciling the world unto Himself. He who knew no sin became a sin-offering, that fallen, sinful human beings, through repentance and confession, might receive pardon. He became our propitiation, that man, repentant, humbled, receiving the merits of Christ, might be made the righteousness of God in Him. \n\n\n                                   -366-",
