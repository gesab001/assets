    "word": "The words, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,\" are spoken to each one of Christ's followers. All who are ordained into the life of Christ are ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow men. The same longing of soul that He felt for the saving of the lost is to be manifest in them. Not all can fill the same place, but for all there is a place and a work. All upon whom God's blessing have been bestowed are to respond by actual service; every gift is to be employed for the advancement of His kingdom. - \"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. VIII, pp. 15, 16.",
