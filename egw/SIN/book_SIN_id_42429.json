    "word": "And now, I have just read your letter in which is contained the advice in regard to Sister Clay. I will think of these things and try to move wisely. The money from Boulder came safely and I am glad that matter is no more to be a worriment to me. I hope you will not keep under the high pressure plan. I hope you will be exercising all that is possible in the open air, Willie. There is need that we jealously guard our strength and that we do not work imprudently, and I believe the Lord will help us from His abundant mercy. I have not been able to do much writing for a few days. I have been too heavily burdened, but the Lord is good and greatly to be praised.",
