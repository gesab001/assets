    "word": "The Lord would have kept the Sanitarium pure and true, to represent the truth for these last days. But the very ones who could have helped you to do this work, you despised and turned from as unworthy of your notice. God sees that His work is being lowered into the slums, as Satan wants it to be; that the elevated sanctification of the truth will become so mingled with tares that its peculiar, holy character will sink out of sight. The Lord saw how this would be, and He has been sending you warnings. Yet you are tempted to go right on in your own way and pick flaws in the message, just as others have done before you.--Letter 215, 1899, pp. 6,7, 12,15,16. (To J. H. Kellogg, December 12, 1899.)",
