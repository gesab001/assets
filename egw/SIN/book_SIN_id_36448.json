    "word": "In Poverty and Helplessness \n\n     Let two or more persons start out together in evangelistic work. They may not get any particular encouragement from those at the head of the work that they will be sustained but nevertheless, let them go forward, praying, singing, teaching living the truth. They may take up the important work of canvassing, and in this way introduce the truth into many families. As they move forward in their work, they gain a blessed experience. They are humbled by a sense of their poverty and helplessness, but the Lord manifestly goes before them.",
