    "word": "I saw that if Stephen Haskell had spent his time in laboring with his hands, which he has spent in travelling, it would have been much more pleasing to God. I saw that he had done much more hurt than two or three following after him could undo, because evil grows of itself, and when once it has taken root it thrives; but good has to be continually nourished and cherished in order to live. Evil is like weeds in a garden that need no nourishing but will grow rank. Unless the precious plants are constantly cherished and dug about, the weeds rise higher than the precious plants, shutting out the sun from them, and they grow sickly and die.",
