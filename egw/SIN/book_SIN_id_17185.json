    "word": "David often triumphed in God, and yet he dwelt much upon his own unworthiness and sinfulness. His conscience was not asleep or dead. \"My sin,\" he cried, \"is ever before me.\" Psalm 51:3 . He did not flatter himself that sin was a matter with which he had nothing to do, and that should not concern him. As he saw the depths of deceit in his heart, he . . . prayed that God would . . . cleanse him from secret faults.",
