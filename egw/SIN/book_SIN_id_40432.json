    "word": "The Lord has sent warnings and reproof, but they have not been heeded. In the Battle Creek buildings important interests have been piled up which should have been distributed over a larger territory.

Let the men who are so fearful of their record here in this world only be one quarter as anxious to have their record good on high, to have their motives pure, and lofty, and unsullied, and they will feel safe in committing their case to God's tribunal. Then they can say, \"It is a small thing for me to be judged by any man's judgment.\"--Letter 19a, 1897. (To \"Brethren in Battle Creek,\" July 27, 1897.)",
