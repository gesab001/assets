We are to present Christ and Him crucified, that souls who are dead in trespasses and sins may be alarmed and quickened. Those who seek to teach others need to be converted to Christ; they need to plead with God that He will imbue them with His Holy Spirit before they can lift up Christ as the sinner's only hope. Flowery speeches, pleasing tales, anecdotes, and stories do not convict the sinner. Men listen to such words as they would listen to a pleasant song, and the laborers gather but few sheaves into the garner. The message the sinner should hear is, \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" [John 3:16]. And the truth will subdue and tender the soul of the teacher because he feels its practical utility.--Ms 12, 1891.",
