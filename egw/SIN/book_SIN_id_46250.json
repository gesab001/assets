At times I have been ready to take steps that would be called aggressive. I would commence to write the history of the experience that we had in Europe. I would read over the letters containing warning and caution that I have had from the Lord for several in Battle Creek. At times, I have felt that I must print all the warnings given me for Dr. Kellogg, especially some that were given me while in Europe. But I have not yet done this because I have been impressed to wait. If I should make a strong move in this direction, the battle would be on. Those who are opposing the light God has given would feel that they had been attacked, and would claim that they were compelled to make moves that otherwise they would not have made. And it would take much of our time to meet the issue.",
