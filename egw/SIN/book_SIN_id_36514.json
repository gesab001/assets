    "word": "Very many profess to be servants of Jesus Christ who are none of his. They are deceiving their own souls to their own destruction. While they profess to be servants of Jesus Christ, they are not living in obedience to his will. Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; Whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? Many, while professing to be servants of Jesus Christ, are obeying another master, and working daily against the Master of whom they profess to be servants. No \n                                                                           6\nman can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.",
