    "word": "Our sanitariums should be controlled by those who are under the control of the Holy Spirit. Those whose minds are easily disturbed by passion are not to be selected to fill a position where they would exert a moulding influence upon human minds; for they would misrepresent the character of the work. God would have in prominent places men who will take hold of His strength. They may labor under inconveniences, but this need not spoil their experience. Every manifestation of passion is sin.",
