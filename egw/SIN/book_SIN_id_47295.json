Eldridge and wife\n\n                                                          E-20-1894 \n                                                          April 14, 1894 \n\nDear Brother and Sister Eldridge, \n     Your case is urged upon my mind,- your spiritual condition as it was after you accepted the truth, and as it is at the present time. Your principles are not now what they should be or what they might have been if you had appreciated the light of [the] Sun of Righteousness, and had walked in its rays as they shone upon your path. The Lord brought you, Brother Eldridge, in connection with his established institutions because he had blessed you with talents, which, if sanctified, would be a blessing to his cause and work. But without the Holy Spirit of God to bless and encourage your advancement as a learner, you would not obtain the experience essential for you as a wise manager in a line of work demanding faithfulness in every particular. Unless you should submit yourself to be educated and taught of God, you could not fill successfully the position to which you were called. There must be no confederating together on the part of any of the workers to carry out their own purposes; for one would surely mislead another.",
