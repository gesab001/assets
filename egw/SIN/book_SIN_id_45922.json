    "word": "These things have kept my soul in great distress. At times I rise above it a little and yet I know that the wound is not cured, because if it were the matter would not be continually presented to me. A thing that is healed, is healed. I was referred to the case of Achan. The entire congregation of Israel was affected by Achan's sin. Because of it God could not help them, and when they went out to battle they were beaten by their enemies. Joshua prostrated himself before the Lord and asked, \"What does it mean that the children of Israel flee before their enemies?\" God told him that there was an accursed thing in the camp, that spoil had been taken from the enemies of Israel. He told him that there was robbery and dissembling in the camp and that His blessing could not rest on the people till these things were cleansed from them.",
