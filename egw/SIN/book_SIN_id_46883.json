    "word": "While we dwell upon the paternal character of God, and His love expressed for man in the gift of His only begotten Son, we must tell people why such a costly sacrifice was necessary. It was because of sin. What is sin? The transgression of the law. Only the Son of God could pay the penalty, and that by His own humiliation and death. As men look at the cross, conscience will be aroused. They will see the majesty of the law, the holiness of God, and their own unlikeness to His character. They will flee for refuge to Jesus Christ, who can cleanse them from every stain of sin and adopt them into the royal family, making them sons of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. Then will the words of the prayer He offered to His Father be verified: \"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. . . . And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.\" John 17:23-26. \n                                                                           782",
