    "word": "This is the experience the Lord desires every Seventh-day Adventist to gain. He desires them to understand the Scriptures so thoroughly that they will have a whole treasure house of knowledge from which to draw. Then they will be able to feed the flock of God with his Word. They will not think that they must bring forward some original theory in order to make their ministry successful. They will not think that they must hunt up tests new and odd and strange. These are sophistries which taste strongly of the dish, fables which have no power to sanctify, purify, and cleanse the soul from the uncleanness which sin brings in its train.",
