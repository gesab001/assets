    "word": "Why the Blessing is Withheld from Some \n\n     Hasten, my brethren and sisters, to bring to God a faithful tithe, and to bring Him also a willing thank offering. There are many who will not be blessed till they make restitution of the tithe which they have withheld. God is waiting for you to redeem the past. The hand of the holy law is laid upon every soul who enjoys God's benefits. Let those who have kept back their tithe make an accurate reckoning, and bring to the Lord that of which they have robbed His work. Make restitution, and bring the Lord peace offerings. \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\" If you acknowledge that you have done wrong in misappropriating His goods, and freely and fully repent, He will forgive your transgression.--R. & H., Dec. 10, 1901.",
