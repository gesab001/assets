    "word": "We have enjoyed the society of our children very much. Soon after we came here, Edson took us all for a trip up the river in his steamer, The Morning Star. Brethren Magan and Sutherland were here, looking for land on which to establish a school for the training of teachers, and we thought that perhaps it might be well to look for a way up the river. Then, too, Edson was very weary, and so was I, and we thought that a few days' rest and quiet would be a blessing to us both. And it proved to be a very great blessing. I was able to sleep well every night while on the boat. The rest and peace did me much good. The scenery was beautiful, and we all enjoyed looking at it.--Letter 213, 1904, p. 1. (To Brother and Sister Richart, June 30, 1904.) \n\n\n                                  -268-",
