    "word": "Do not educate your children to think that your love for them must be expressed by indulging their pride, their extravagance, their love of display. There is no time now to invent ways for using up money. Your inventive faculties are to be put to the stretch, to see how you can economize. Instead of gratifying selfish inclination, spending money for those things which destroy the reasoning faculties, study how to deny self, that you may have something to invest in lifting the standard of truth in new fields. The intellect is a talent; use it in studying how your means can best be employed for the salvation of souls.",
