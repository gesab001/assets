    "word": "The same words are applicable to many practicing physicians who are called Christians. The medical profession is no less under the jurisdiction of the Lord, under the rule of the standard of righteousness, than is the farmer, the merchant, or the minister of the gospel. The physician is as much under obligation to represent pure and undefiled religion in his business transactions as is any other man in any profession. He is required to love and obey God, to relieve the sick and afflicted, for Christ's sake. The love and pity of Christ must pervade the soul, and the physician that has the fear of God before his eyes will deal tenderly with Christ's poor, and justly with all men; for he will realize that he must meet the record of the deeds done in the body at the judgment bar of God. All work done for Christ's sake, unselfishly, will obtain a quality, achieve a success, beyond all earthly compensation; for Christ's righteousness will be imputed to such a worker. Every physician should be inspired by the love of Christ, that his work may have upon it the fashioning hand of the great Physician. In Christ we behold the characteristics of the true physician.",
