    "word": "The love, the tender compassion, the marvelous condescension of Christ for his disciples is without a parallel. He made them the depositaries of sacred truth, as they could comprehend it. But He said to them, \"I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" (John 16:12) Although Christ was with them, as their instructor, yet their former teaching had so moulded their ideas and opinions that should Christ unfold the many things he longed to communicate, they would have misinterpreted his words. While \n                                                                           56\nhe was with them, He sought to impress upon them the knowledge there was for them in the mysteries of the kingdom of God. He would have them see that it was an evidence of his love for Him to lift the veil of the future, and make them the depositaries of knowledge concerning events to come. But much He had told them had been dimly comprehended, and much would be forgotten. He told them that after His crucifixion and ascension the Holy Spirit would open many things to them, and give them a better understanding of what He had tried to tell them. He would still continue to reveal sacred truth to them, and His Spirit would more fully impart truth to them.",
