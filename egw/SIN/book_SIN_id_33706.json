    "word": "There are many in the world who indulge pernicious habits. Appetite is the law that governs them; and because of their wrong habits, the moral sense is clouded and the power to discern sacred things is to a great extent destroyed. But it is necessary for Christians to be strictly temperate. They should place their standard high. Temperance in eating, drinking, and dressing is essential. Principle should rule instead of appetite or fancy. Those who eat too much, or whose food is of an objectionable quality, are easily led into dissipation, and into other \u201cfoolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition\u201d (1 Timothy 6:9). The \u201clabourers together with God\u201d should use every jot of their influence to encourage the spread of true temperance principles.",
