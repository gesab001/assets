    "word": "Walling's Mills, Friday, September 12, 1873. We have decided to go to Central Park. We went to Central around by McCameron's [?]. She was not at home. We lost our journey. We drove as fast as possible to Central. We called upon Mr. Parker. We took with us fomentation flannels. My husband gave treatment to Mr. Parker, which seemed to work favorably. He is certainly in a very bad way. His throat is distressingly inflamed, making it very painful for him to swallow even liquid. We are trying to improve his condition. Mrs. Johnson, with whom he boards, seems to be a very kind, benevolent lady. We took dinner at her table. We hope our visit was not unprofitable.",
