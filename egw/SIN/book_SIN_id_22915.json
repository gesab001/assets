    "word": "Then my eyes were taken from the glory, and I was pointed to the remnant on the earth. Said the angel to them, \u201cWill ye shun the seven last plagues? Will ye go to glory, and enjoy all that God has prepared for those that love him, and are willing to suffer for his sake? If so, ye must die that ye may live. Get ready, get ready, get ready. Ye must have a greater preparation than ye now have, for the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it. Sacrifice all to God. Lay all upon his altar, self, property and all, a living sacrifice. It will take all to enter glory. Lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven where no thief can approach or rust corrupt. Ye must be partakers of Christ's sufferings here, if ye would be partakers with him of his glory hereafter.\u201d",
