    "word": "Be comforted, my sister, in the Lord. \"Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us . . ., arm yourselves likewise with the same mind\" (1 Peter 4:1). I urge you in your suffering to stay your soul upon God. The Lord will be your help, your strength, your comfort. Then look to Him and trust in Him. We must receive our consolation from Christ. Learn in His school His meekness and lowliness of heart. Let every word you speak show that you recognize the goodness, the mercy, and the love of God. Be determined to be a comfort and a blessing to all in the home. Create a sweet, pure, heavenly atmosphere. . . .",
