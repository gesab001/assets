    "word": "Christ says to His undershepherds, \"I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain\" (John 15:16). How can we do a work that will bear the test and strain of trial? By directing the people to the Source of all power. Christ does not say, If any man thirst, let him go to Brother J or some other disciple. No. He says, \"Let him come unto Me and drink.\" God does not say of the sinner, \"Let him take hold of the strength of some human being.\" No, no. He says, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me\" (Isaiah 27:5).",
