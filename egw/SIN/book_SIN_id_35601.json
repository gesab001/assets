    "word": "Many are becoming careless and irreverent concerning the Sabbath; but if we would have the blessing \n\n\n                          - 43 - \n\npronounced that is to be pronounced upon the obedient, it will be necessary that we observe the Sabbath more strictly. Even in traveling upon the cars and steamers, we are to set the right example before our children and youth. It may be necessary for us to travel on the Sabbath in order to reach the churches who need our help, and to give them the message that God would have them hear; but we should secure our tickets, and make all other arrangements on some other day, if it is unavoidable and if we must travel upon the cars or steamboats. When traveling on the cars or boats on the Sabbath day, we should withdraw ourselves from undesirable company, and commune with God. But if through the providence of God, we have an opportunity to speak a word in regard to the truth to those who are in our company, we should improve the opportunity. If any one is suffering, and we can relieve their pain, we should put into exercise the wisdom and knowledge God has given us in doing it. But we need not engage in conversation concerning business matters. We need to be always learning in the school of Christ in order that we may be teachers. Every day our obligation is proportional to our ability. God requires heart-service. He requires that we should be consecrated to him at all times and in all places.",
