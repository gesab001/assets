    "word": "If we do otherwise, a combative spirit will arise at the first approach of anything that differs from our views. We may be led on by the enemy to take a position against the truth, because it does not come in a way to suit us; and in the spirit of the deceived Jews, we shall resist the light which God sends; and that light, instead of being the blessing which heaven meant it to be to us, to advance us in spirituality and in the knowledge of God, will become a stumbling-block, over which we shall be constantly falling. We shall become irritated and indignant, for enmity is in our heart against God's truth. If evidence is afterwards presented from the Scriptures, it will not be received by him who has rejected light. The men of Nazareth opened their hearts to unbelief, and as the result they rejected Christ. The combative spirit will rise against the truth, and unfair means will be taken to influence others, and to make it of none effect. The Lord would have our intellect sanctified, elevated, ennobled, that we may distinguish truth from error, and bring the truth into the soul temple, that it may exercise an influence upon our spirit and character.",
