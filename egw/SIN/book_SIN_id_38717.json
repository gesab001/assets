    "word": "The Saviour of the world was the adored of the angels, he was a prince in the royal courts of Heaven. But he lay aside his glory and clothed his divinity with humanity. He became the meek and lowly Jesus. His riches and glory he left in Heaven, and he became poor that we, through his poverty might be made rich. Three years he was going from place to place, a homeless wanderer. But selfish men will repine and murmur if called to leave their little earthly treasure for Christ's sake, or to labor in the work of saving souls for whom Christ gave his precious life. Oh what ingratitude! No one can appreciate the blessings of redemption unless he feels that he can joyfully afford to make any and every sacrifice for the love of Christ. Every sacrifice made for Christ enriches the giver and every suffering and privation endured for his dear sake increases the overcomer's final joy in Heaven.",
