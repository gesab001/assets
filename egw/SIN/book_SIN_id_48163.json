    "word": "How can the sinner be redeemed? When the conscience has been awakened to a sense of an intolerable burden of guilt, what will give a hope that outweighs all discouragement and despair? \"It is Christ that died.\" O, price above all price!! Rejoice, sinful one; sin is not infinite. However aggravated its character, however oppressive the guilt of conscience, there is blessed hope. \"Though your sins be as scarlet,\" repentant one, despair not. \"They shall be as white as wool; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\" \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\"",
