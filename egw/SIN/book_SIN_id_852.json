    "word": "Little did the gay, thoughtless youth, as he went out from his father\u2019s gate, dream of the ache and longing left in that father\u2019s heart. When he danced and feasted with his wild companions, little did he think of the shadow that had fallen on his home. And now as with weary and painful steps he pursues the homeward way, he knows not that one is watching for his return. But while he is yet \u201ca great way off\u201d the father discerns his form. Love is of quick sight. Not even the degradation of the years of sin can conceal the son from the father\u2019s eyes. He \u201chad compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck\u201d in a long, clinging, tender embrace.",
