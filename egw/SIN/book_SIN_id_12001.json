    "word": "In the Sabbath congregation we saw a number of new ones who had become interested in the truth through reading. Among these were several young men, students from a theological school in the city.

He understands the French, the German, and the English, has served a two-years\u2019 apprenticeship in a printing office, and is now doing good work in our office as German translator. As we near the end, and the work increases, we look for such conversions to be more and more frequent. All through these countries there is talent that God will yet use to advance his cause.",
