The question you \n\n\n                                  -154- \n\nask in reference to giving Miller possession, I do not now recollect what I had in mind. As nothing has been said to him about possession, I will not now say anything. Let him handle the matter as he chooses. I have no intentions that I know of; I have made no suggestions to Miller since the last agreement which was that I would give him $1300 (?) difference in trade.--Letter 84, 1891. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Dec. 17, 1987. Entire Letter.",
