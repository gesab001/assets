July 23, 1889 \n\nElders Madison and Howard Miller,- \n\nMy Brethren, \n     There are lessons that are essential for you to learn. You have a theory of the truth, but you have not the spirit of it. You have not the power of God in your hearts to draw souls to Jesus. Brother Madison Miller has been placed in a responsible position, where he could be a great blessing to the churches, if he were in right relation to God Himself, but he thinks that he has all the qualifications necessary for his position, when he has not the sanctifying grace of Christ. He has not the blessed assurance that the promises of God are for him. He does not know what it is to walk by faith. He fails to carefully consider points of doctrine that are new to him, and is ever ready to question and cavil over that which he does not understand, and unbelief is the first thing that presents itself. He scatters seeds of doubt, and does not seek earnestly for the grace of Christ in His soul. He does not possess a personal interest in the truth as it is in Jesus. He does not glorify God for the marvelous display of His love in bringing salvation within his reach. He is imbued with the spirit of Phariseeism which excludes from the soul the light of heaven. Self-satisfied he does not see his own spiritual destitution.",
