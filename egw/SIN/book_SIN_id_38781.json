    "word": "There is frequent necessity for plainly rebuking sin and reproving wrong. But ministers engaged in the work of the salvation of their fellow-men, should not be pitiless toward the errors of one another, and should not make prominent the defects in their organization. They should not \n                                                                           112\nexpose or reprove their weaknesses. They should inquire if such a course would bring about the desired effect with themselves, would it increase their love for, and confidence in, the one who thus made prominent their mistakes. Especially should the mistakes of ministers who are engaged in the work of God be kept within as small a circle as possible, for there are many weak ones who will take advantage if they are aware that those who minister in word and doctrine have weaknesses like other men. And it is a most cruel thing for the faults of a minister to be exposed to unbelievers, if that minister in future is counted worthy to labor for the salvation of souls. No good can come of this exposure, but only harm. God frowns upon this course, for it is undermining the confidence of the people in those whom God accepts to carry forward his work. The character of every fellow-laborer should be jealously guarded by brother ministers. Saith God, \"Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.\" Love and confidence should be cherished. A lack of love and confidence in one minister for another does not increase the happiness of the one thus deficient, but as he makes his brother unhappy, he is unhappy himself. There is greater power in love than was ever found in censure. Love will melt its way through \n                                                                           113\nbarriers, while censure will close up every avenue of the soul.",
