    "word": "\"I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside Me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known Me; that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the West, that there is none beside Me. I am the Lord, and there is none else; I form light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things. Drop down, ye heavens from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together. I the Lord have created it.\" (Isaiah 45:5-8)",
