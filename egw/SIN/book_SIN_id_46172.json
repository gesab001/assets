    "word": "The Lord has marked out His way of working. As a people we are not to imitate and fall in with the Salvation Army methods. This is not the work the Lord has given us to do. Neither is it our work to condemn them and speak harsh words against them. There are precious, self-sacrificing souls in the Salvation Army. We are to treat them kindly. There are in the Army honest souls, sincerely serving the Lord, who will see greater light, and will advance to the acceptance of all truth. Those in the Salvation Army are trying to save the neglected downtrodden ones. Discourage them not. Let them do that class of work by their own methods and in their own way. The Lord has plainly stated what the Seventh-day Adventists are to do. Camp-meetings are to be appointed, and a series of tent-meetings held. There should be no hesitancy in presenting the truth applicable for this time. A decided testimony is to be borne. The discourses given should be so simple that children can understand them. \n\n\n                               -37-",
