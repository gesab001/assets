    "word": "Those who have been blessed with superior talents should not depreciate the value of the services of those who are less gifted than themselves. The smallest trust is a trust from God. The one talent, through diligent use with the blessing of God, will be doubled, and the two used in the service of Christ will be increased to four; and thus the humblest instrument may grow in power and usefulness. The earnest purpose, the self-denying efforts, are all seen, appreciated, and accepted by the God of heaven. \u201cTake heed that ye despise not one of these little ones.\u201d God alone can estimate the worth of their service, and see the far-reaching influence of those who work for the glory of their Maker.",
