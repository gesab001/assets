    "word": "The only day that God has set His seal upon is the seventh. While He has given us the six days He has taken the seventh as His that His order of worship might be preserved. Neither the house of God nor His day should be used for visiting, but our thoughts should be upon heaven and heavenly things. Let there be no disunion one with another. If feelings should arise in your heart with a brother or sister, do not let the sun go down until such feelings be removed, that you may retain the blessing of God with you.",
