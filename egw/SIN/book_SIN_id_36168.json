We must seek the Lord earnestly every day, if we would be prepared for the experiences that come to us. Our hearts are to be cleansed from every feeling of superiority, and the living principles of the truth are to be planted in the soul. Young and aged and middle-aged should now be practising the virtues of Christ's character. They should daily be making spiritual development, that they may become vessels unto honor in the Master's service.",
