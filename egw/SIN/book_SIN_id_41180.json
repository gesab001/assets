    "word": "I address the ministers. Lead the people along step by step, dwelling upon Christ's efficiency until, by a living faith, they see Jesus as He is--see Him in His fullness, a sin-pardoning Saviour, One who can pardon all our transgressions. It is by beholding that we become changed into His likeness. \n\n\n                                    -271- \n\nThis is present truth. We have talked the law. This is right. But we have only casually lifted up Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour.",
