    "word": "Brother _____ has made meat his staple article of diet. He loves meat, and has established himself in the habit of eating it. He may be strong enough to stand a meat diet, but it is not so with his wife and family, who are not strong and well. His wife suffers and cannot tell why, but gratification of appetite is the greatest cause of her ill health. Brother _____ knows what the Word of God teaches in this matter, but he does not practice it. This is not pleasing to God.",
