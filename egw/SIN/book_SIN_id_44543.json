Kress.) \n\n\n     I am instructed to lift before our people the high standard to which we must attain. Many choose to follow their own unsanctified ideas, and have lost sight of this standard. They walk and talk in a way that is detrimental to healthful piety. Spiritual life is maintained only by a daily life of obedience to all the commandments of God. The law of heaven, by which the whole universe is governed, must be brought into our everyday experiences in this world. Thus the believer evidences that he is receiving Christ, and that he is a partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. So long as we are in this world of sin, we must engage in a constant spiritual warfare.",
