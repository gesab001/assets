    "word": "Chap. 38 - The Temptation of Christ\n[THIS\nARTICLE APPEARED IN THE REVIEW\nAND HERALD, JULY 28, 1874.]\n\n     Christ was not in as favorable a position in the desolate wilderness to endure the temptations of Satan as was Adam when he was tempted in Eden. The Son of God humbled Himself and took man's nature after the race had wandered four thousand years from Eden, and from their original state of purity and uprightness. Sin had been making its terrible marks upon the race for ages; and physical, mental, and moral degeneracy prevailed throughout the human family.",
