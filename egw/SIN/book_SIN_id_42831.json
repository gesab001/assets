    "word": "The Paradise Valley Sanitarium is full of patients also, and those in charge will be obliged to provide more room for the accommodation of those who are coming in. Yesterday I had a letter from Brother E. S. Ballenger, the manager of the institution, in which he says that all the rooms in the building are filled, and that there are eight more persons who desire to come for treatment. As yet, no advertising at all has been done, and yet the patients continue to come. I meant to have had Brother Ballenger's letter copied, so that I might send it to you, but it was sent on to Willie.",
