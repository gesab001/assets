    "word": "IN RELATING HER EARLY VISIONS, MRS. WHITE GRAPHICALLY PORTRAYED THE EXPERIENCES THROUGH WHICH THE ADVENTIST PEOPLE WERE TO PASS BEFORE THE LORD SHOULD COME. AT A TIME WHEN THE MANIFESTATIONS OF SPIRITUALISM WERE CONFINED TO THE \"MYSTERIOUS RAPPINGS\" IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, SHE WAS SHOWN THE RAPID AND PHENOMENAL GROWTH THAT CULT WOULD MAKE IN THE FUTURE. SHE FORETOLD THE PASSING OF LAWS ENFORCING\n252\nSUNDAY OBSERVANCE IN COUNTRIES WHERE AT THE TIME FULL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PREVAILED. ALL THESE PREDICTIONS, AND MANY OTHERS, HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED AND WIDELY CIRCULATED. THE CHANGING EVENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE THESE PREDICTIONS WERE WRITTEN HAVE PROVED THE TRUTHFULNESS OF MANY OF THEM, AND THEIR FULFILLMENT HAS INSPIRED INCREASED CONFIDENCE THAT HER PROPHECIES CONCERNING THE FINAL TRIUMPH OF THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CAUSE WILL BE LIKEWISE FULFILLED. THE PROSPERITY OF THIS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN SIGNALLY ADVANCED BY THE COUNSELS AND ADMONITIONS THAT HAVE COME, THROUGH HER VOICE AND PEN, TO ITS LEADERS AND WORKERS.",
