    "word": "Christ was the mighty Healer of all spiritual and physical maladies. Look, O look upon the sympathetic Redeemer. With the eye of faith behold him walking in the streets of the cities, gathering the weak and weary to himself. Helpless, sinful human beings crowd about him. See the mothers with their sick and dying little ones in their arms pressing through the crowd, that they may get within reach of his notice and touch. Let the eye of faith take in the scene. Watch these mothers pressing their way to him, pale, weary, almost despairing, yet determined and persevering, bearing their burden of suffering in their arms.",
