    "word": "The gospel is the power and wisdom of God, if it is correctly represented by those who claim to be Christians. Christ crucified for our sins should humble every soul before God in his own estimation. Christ risen from the dead, ascended on high, our living intercessor in the presence of God, is the science of salvation which we need to learn and teach to children and youth. Said Christ, \"I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified.\" This is the work that ever devolves upon every teacher. There must not be any haphazard work in this matter, for even the work of educating the children in the day schools requires very much of the grace of Christ and the subduing of self. Those who naturally are fretful, easily provoked, and who have cherished the habit of criticism, of thinking evil, should find some other kind of work that will not reproduce any of their unlovely traits of character in the children and youth; for they have cost too much. Heaven sees in the child the undeveloped man or woman, with capabilities and powers that, if correctly guided and with heavenly wisdom developed, will become the human agencies through whom the divine influences can cooperate to be laborers together with God. Sharp words, and continual censure bewilder the child, but never reform him. Keep back that pettish word. Keep under discipline to Jesus Christ your own spirit; then will you learn how to pity and sympathize with those brought under your influence. Do not exhibit impatience and harshness, for, if these children did not need educating, they would not need the advantages of the school. They are to be patiently, kindly, and in love brought up the ladder of progress, climbing step by step in obtaining knowledge.",
