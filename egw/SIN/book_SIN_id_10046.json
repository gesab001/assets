    "word": "Christ has given us an example of this. When invited to eat with publicans and sinners, He did not refuse; for in no other way than by mingling with them could He reach this class. But on every occasion . . . He opened up themes of conversation which brought things of eternal interest to their minds. And He enjoins us, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" [Matthew 5:16.]",
