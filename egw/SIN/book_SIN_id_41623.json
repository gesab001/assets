    "word": "When, instead of coming in the pomp and splendor of the mighty kings of the earth, Christ came as a humble man, possessing human nature, how great was their chagrin and disappointment! Surely this was not the man who would deliver them. They would not own Him as their King. He came not among the most honorable, or to receive homage as kings of the earth receive homage from their subjects. He came among the poor and the needy. He was found among the oppressed. He relieved the wants of the destitute and stood by the side of the most humble. \n\n\n                                -153- \n\nThinking that this man could not be the Messiah for whom they looked, they refused to acknowledge Him.",
