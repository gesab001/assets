    "word": "The drunkard destroys himself, soul and body, and brings unhappiness and degradation to his family. His perceptions are deadened by self-indulgence, and he cares not that his children are loathsome in the sight of heavenly angels and in the sight of human beings. He cares not that they are unfed, ragged, and ignorant. With a lavish hand the Lord has bestowed His blessings upon human beings. But drunkenness is depriving thousands and thousands of that which the Lord desires them to enjoy.",
