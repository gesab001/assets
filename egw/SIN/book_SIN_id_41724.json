    "word": "Sunday Laws in Australia--We are having interesting times for all in Australia. The pressure of the Sunday law has come and is coming. It has been ordered that all stores shall be closed on Sunday, and this is being rigidly enforced. The government is trying to have God acknowledged in the constitution. Our people are making just as vigorous a stand as possible that it shall not be. They have been securing names to a petition to this effect. We can see that that which we have been talking about for the last thirty-five years--this law causing the Sunday to be exalted and making human inventions take the place of God's holy day--is now being fulfilled. There is much excitement now in regard to these matters.",
