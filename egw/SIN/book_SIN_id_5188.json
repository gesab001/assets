    "word": "Enduring Substance or Passing Shadow \n\n     Christ calls upon the members of His church to cherish the true, genuine hope of the gospel. He points them upward, distinctly assuring them that the riches that endure are above, not below. Their hope is in heaven, not on the earth. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,\" He says; \"and all these things\"--all that is essential for your good-- \"shall be added unto you.\"",
