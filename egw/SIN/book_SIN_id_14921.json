    "word": "There is no limit to the good you may do. If you make the word of God the rule of your life, and govern your actions by its precepts, making all your purposes and exertions in the fulfilling of your duty a blessing and not a curse to others, success will crown your efforts. You have placed yourself in connection with God; you have become a channel of light to others. You are honored by becoming co-laborers with Jesus; and no higher honor can you receive than the blessed benediction from the lips of the Saviour: \"Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" --The Youth's Instructor, September 1, 1886. \n\n                                               -",
