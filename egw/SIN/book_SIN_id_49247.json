    "word": "There will be disagreeable tasks to be performed. Let no duty be overlooked, with the expectation that someone else will perform it. Let there be no superficial work done in any part of the school. Take hold of the forbidding task, and master it, and thus you will obtain a victory. The putting off even of little duties weakens the habits of promptness that should be encouraged. Cultivate the habit of seeing what ought to be done, and do it promptly. If a board is broken in the walk, do not leave it for someone else to repair. Let each one feel a responsibility for the care of the premises. Overcome natural indolence. Do not neglect the disagreeable things, supposing that they will be attended to by someone else. All these rules are important for the formation of right character.",
