    "word": "Chap. 28 - Love the Constraining Power\n\n     There is altogether too little sympathy brought into our labor for souls. There is not that beseeching, wooing, drawing power that God requires us to exert that souls may be reconciled to Him. If we teach the truth as it is in Jesus, religion will not be regarded as a drudgery, but as a delight. Let the teachers bring sunshine, gratitude, and hearts full of tenderness and Christlike compassion, into their work, and leaven the hearts of their scholars with the spirit of unselfish love; for this is the spirit that pervades heaven. Shall not the workers in the Sabbath-school divest themselves of all pride and self-love, and heartily and sincerely become doers of the word? \u201cPut ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfil the lust thereof.\u201d Genuine faith confides in Christ, and renders implicit submission, consenting to follow Him \n101\nwheresoever He goeth. When this is fulfilled, as a result of well-directed efforts, many souls will be brought as precious sheaves to the Master.",
