    "word": "Tuesday, Nov. 15, 1859. We rose early and took our breakfast. Had a season of prayer and then started on our weary journey. . . . About noon tarried to rest the horses. Then took a little luncheon, and in one hour were on our way again to Monterey. The plank road is very rough, but for ten miles the road is very bad. Log ways, mud holes, and yet on we go, singing, \"The way may be rough, but it cannot be long,\" etc. As we came up to Brother G. Lay's he stopped us and urged us to go in. We complied with his request and tarried with him overnight.",
