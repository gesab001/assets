    "word": "Ministers to Help Recruit Canvassers.--This is a time when the conference should stand before the people in a better light than it has hitherto done. We shall call upon the people to help to the utmost of their ability just now. We shall call upon them to do a work which will be pleasing to \n\n276 \n\nGod in purchasing the book. [CHRIST'S OBJECT LESSONS.] We shall ask that every available means be used to help to circulate this book. We shall ask, if possible, that the whole field be supplied with canvassers. We shall call upon our ministers as they visit the churches to encourage men and women to go out as canvassers, to make a decided forward movement in the path of self-denial by giving part of their earnings to help our schools to get out of debt. Surely they can do this much to help the Master.--MS 10, 1900.",
