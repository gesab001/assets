    "word": "All to Understand What to Do for Themselves \n\n     Your question is, . . . \"In urgent cases, should we call in a worldly physician, because the sanitarium doctors are all so busy that they have no time to devote to outside \n                                                                           290\npractice?\"...If the physicians are so busy that they cannot treat the sick outside of the institution, would it not be wiser for all to educate themselves in the use of simple remedies, than to venture to use drugs that are given a long name to hide their real qualities. Why need anyone be ignorant of God's remedies--hot-water fomentations and cold and hot compresses. It is important to become familiar with the benefit of dieting in case of sickness. All should understand what to do [for] themselves. They may call upon someone who understands nursing, but everyone should have an intelligent knowledge of the house he lives in. All should understand what to do in case of sickness.",
