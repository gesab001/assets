    "word": "In following Christ, looking unto Him who is the Author And Finisher of your faith, you will feel that you are working under \n22\nHis eye, that you are influenced by His presence, and that He knows your motives. At every step you will humbly inquire: Will this please Jesus? Will it glorify God? Morning and evening your earnest prayers should ascend to God for His blessing and guidance. True prayer takes hold upon Omnipotence and gives us the victory. Upon his knees the Christian obtains strength to resist temptation.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, 615, 616.)",
