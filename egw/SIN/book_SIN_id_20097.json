    "word": "The life of Christ is to be carefully meditated upon, and to be constantly studied with a desire to understand the reason why He had to come at all. We can only form our conclusions by searching the Scriptures as Christ has enjoined upon us to do, for He says, \"They testify of me.\" We may find by searching the Word the virtues of obedience in contrast with the sinfulness of disobedience. \"As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.\"",
