    "word": "Revivals.--When the Lord works through human instrumentalities, when men are moved with power from on high, Satan leads his agents to cry, \"Fanaticism!\" and to warn people not to go to extremes. Let all be careful how they raise this cry; for though there is counterfeit coin, this does not lower the value of that which is genuine. Because there are spurious revivals and spurious conversions, it does not follow that all revivals are to be held in suspicion. Let us not show the contempt manifested by the Pharisees when they said, \"This man receiveth sinners.\" [Luke 15:2.]",
