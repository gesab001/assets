Daniells, \n       Washington, D.C. Dear Brother Daniells: \n     We are returning from our trip up the river to look for land suitable for school work. We went from Nashville to Carthage, a distance of about one hundred and seventy miles by the river and seventy-eight miles by rail. We looked at several places; but the fertile land up the river is altogether too high in price for us to think of purchasing it for school purposes.",
