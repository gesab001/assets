    "word": "Earthly comforters may do their best. They speak to the ear, but there is no comfort like Christ's, so tender and so true. He is touched with the feelings of our infirmities. His Spirit speaks to the heart. Circumstances may separate friends; the wide, broad sea may roll its restless waters between us and them. Their words and sincere wishes may still exist, and yet they be unable to demonstrate them and do for us that which would be pleasant and gratefully received. But no distance, no circumstances can separate us from \"the Comforter.\" Wherever we are, wherever we may go, He is there, always a Presence, a Person connected with heaven, One given us in Christ's place, to act in His stead. He is always at our right hand, to speak to us soothing, gentle words, to support, sustain, uphold, and cheer.--Letter 89b, 1897, pp. 1, 2. (To Mr. & Mrs. Herbert Lacey, March 22, 1897.)",
