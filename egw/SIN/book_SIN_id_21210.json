He will give them satisfaction and blessing as they go forward in self-sacrificing labor. And He will bless every one of us as we labor in the meekness of Christ. And when I see some seeking for higher wages, I say to myself, \"They are losing a precious blessing.\" I know this to be a fact. I have seen it worked out again and again.",
