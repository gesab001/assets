    "word": "The Lord will by his own methods, break up this indifference of man toward his fellow-man. He will educate and train and discipline his children, O how kindly and lovingly, for their greater consecration and usefulness is his work, and fit them for a higher life. It is by his Word that he instructs, and by experience that he develops virtues and powers, making those in his service meet for the inheritance of the saints in light. If they will surrender to God, and not look to man, or depend on the finite in the place of the Infinite, he will work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Darkness and mysteries compass the path of some who have (not) permitted the Lord to carry forward his work in their hearts, who have not brought their thoughts into captivity to him. If these poor souls who now rise before my mind, had only learned of Jesus, and had not taken counsel of their own unconverted, unsubdued souls, they would now be in the path of obedience, co-workers with Jesus Christ. But they put themselves in their own hands, and did not trust the Lord; and they are not enjoying his blessing, or the faith that works by love and purifies the soul.",
