    "word": "There are a large number who have a theory of the truth, and can prove their doctrines to be scriptural and sound, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Their course of action denies their faith. Their hearts are not sanctified through the truth. They have not the spirit and power of the truth. They are  unholy in heart, and are not Christ-like in deportment. Their works testify of them that they have not the truth as it is in Jesus. To be content to do as others do, and to be satisfied with a half Christian life, is to fail of the standard altogether. Unless the evil of the heart, the \n\n\n                            -3- \n\ndeformity of character, be strenuously corrected day by day according to the copy given us, there will be an entire failure. One darling sin cherished will defile the soul as one drop of ink will color a basin of water.",
