    "word": "Man, finite man, though using for himself the talents which God has reserved to publish salvation, to send the glad news of a Saviour's love to perishing souls, and hedging up the way by his selfishness, inquires, \"Wherein have we robbed thee?\" God answers, \"In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed \n\n\n                   - 72 - \n\nme, even this whole nation.\" The whole world is engaged in robbing God. With the money he has lent them they indulge in dissipation, in amusements, revelings, feasting, and disgraceful indulgences. But God says, \"I will come near you to judgment.\" The whole world will have an account to settle in that great day when every one shall receive sentence according to his deeds.",
