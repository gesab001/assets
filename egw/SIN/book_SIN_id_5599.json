    "word": "Helpful Effort in the School \n\n     The student has a special work to do in the school itself. In the schoolroom and in the school home there are missionary fields awaiting his labors. Here a variety of minds are gathered, many different characters and dispositions. By proving himself a help and blessing to these, the student has the privilege of showing the genuineness of his love for Christ and his willingness to improve the opportunities for service that come to him. By helpful, kindly words and deeds he may impart to his associates the grace of God bestowed on him.",
