    "word": "\"Sing, O ye heavens, and be joyful; and break forth unto singing, O mountains: for the Lord hath comforted His people, and will have mercy on His afflicted. But Zion said, the Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she may not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands; thy walls are continually before me.\" (Isaiah 49:8-16)",
