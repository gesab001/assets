    "word": "I am seated on the bed writing at half past three a.m. Have not slept since half past one o'clock. Ella May White and I are the sole occupants of a large, comfortable family tent. Close by is another good-sized tent, used as a dining tent. We have a rude shanty for a kitchen, and a small five by five storeroom. Next is another tent, which accommodates three of my workmen. Next is a room enclosed but not finished, for wash-house and workshop. This is now used as a bedroom by two men, Bro. Shannon, my master builder, and Bro. Caldwell. These five men we board. Several others are at work on the land who board themselves. Fanny Bolton occupies another tent, well fitted up with her organ and furniture. You see we have quite a village of tents.",
