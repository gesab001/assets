    "word": "Since coming to this country, I have made inquiries concerning the condition of animals that are killed for the market, and I have learned that whole herds were slaughtered when not more than one in twenty were without disease. Pulmonary diseases, cancers, and tumors, are startlingly common among animals. It is true that the inspectors rejected many of the cattle that were thus diseased, but many were passed on to the market that ought to have been refused. Inspectors and herdsmen, I am told, have entered into confederacy in this matter. Some inspectors say, \"This herd or this flock will pass. Leave me this or that sheep, or this or that steer.\" Thus unwholesome flesh has gone on to the markets for human consumption.",
