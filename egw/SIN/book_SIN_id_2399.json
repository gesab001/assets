    "word": "Unfaithfulness To Be Disapproved--Those who prove untrue are to be dealt with in accordance with the wisdom that God will impart.  Never are God's servants to look upon disaffection, scheming, and deception as virtues; those in responsibility are to manifest their decided disapproval of all unfaithfulness in business and spiritual matters.  And they are to choose as counselors in every line of work, only those men in whom they can repose the utmost confidence.--Review and Herald, Sept. 14, 1905.",
