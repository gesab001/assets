    "word": "At Loma Linda, arrangements were made for an out-of-door service. During the forenoon, the friends of the institution began to come in, and at noon a lunch was served to all. Early in the afternoon the people gathered together for the dedication. Seats had been placed on the lawn, under the shadow of a beautiful grove of pepper trees. In front was a large platform, on which were seated the speakers and the singers. I was present only a portion of the time. There were several speakers, and the time was limited. I spoke with freedom for nearly half an hour.",
