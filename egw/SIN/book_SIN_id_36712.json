    "word": "Sensuality is the sin of the age. But the religion of Jesus Christ will hold the lines of control over every species of unlawful liberty; the moral powers will hold \n\n\n                          -33- \n\nthe lines of control over every thought, word, and action. Guile will not be found in the lips of the true Christian. Not an impure thought will be indulged in, not a word spoken that is approaching to sensuality, not an action that has the least appearance of evil. The senses will be guarded. The soul that has Jesus abiding in it will develop into true greatness. The intelligent soul who has respect unto all of God's commandments, through the grace of Christ will say to the passions of the heart as they point to God's great moral standard of righteousness,  \"Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed,\" and the grace of Christ shall be as a wall of fire round about the soul.",
