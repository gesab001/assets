    "word": "I have felt compelled to bear some very straight testimonies to men who, though dead in trespasses and sins, did not realize their true condition. They have even thought that, because they were doing a certain work, they were doing the will of God. But when it came to a representation of Jesus Christ in character, they revealed a decided failure. To those who receive testimony after testimony from the Spirit of God, and do not heed the reproof, the time will come when, unless they repent and are converted, the Spirit will no longer strive with them.",
