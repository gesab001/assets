    "word": "Eagle Harbor, N. Y., July 26, 1861\n     My Dear Children, Henry and Edson: We have not forgotten you, dear boys; but we often think of you, and pray that blessing of God may be with you. We are anxious that you should form correct habits. We are from you so much, and you are left so much to yourselves, that you may be in danger of falling into careless habits, which will not increase your happiness, and which may make those around you unhappy.",
