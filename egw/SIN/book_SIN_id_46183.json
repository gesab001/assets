    "word": "Work is to be done in all parts of the vineyard. In early days of the message a right beginning was made, but the work has not developed as God desired it to develop. Too much has been centered in Battle Creek, and Oakland, and few other places. Our brethren should never have built so largely in one place as they have in Battle Creek. In many fields very little has been done to establish memorials for God. This is wrong. Years ago very many of our workers and people had the spirit of self-denial and self-sacrifice. Success attended their efforts. The Lord has signified that His work should be carried forward in the same spirit in which it was begun. The world is to be warned. Field after field is still unworked. Shall we as a people, by our actions, our business arrangements, our attitude toward a world unsaved, bear a testimony altogether different from the testimony borne by us twenty or thirty years ago? Shall we give evidence of spiritual disease and lack of wise planning? Upon us has shone great light in regard to the last days of this earth's history. The sight of souls perishing in sin should arouse us to give the light of present truth to those now in darkness. God's messengers must be clothed with power. They must have a reverence for the truth that they do not now possess. The Lord's solemn, sacred message of warning must be proclaimed not merely in our churches, but in the most difficult fields and in the most sinful cities,--in every place where the light of the third angel's message has not yet dawned. Every one is to hear the last call to the marriage supper of the Lamb.",
