    "word": "Some of those who are newly come to the faith claim to have special light from God in regard to these messages; but their new light leads them to set aside the established truths that are the pillars of our faith. They misinterpret and misapply the Scriptures. They misplace the messages of Revelation 14, and set aside the work which these messages have accomplished. Thus they reject the great waymarks which God Himself has established. Since their new light leads them to tear down the structure which the Lord has built up, we may know that He is not guiding them.",
