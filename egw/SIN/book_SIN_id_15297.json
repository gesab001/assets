    "word": "Different Environment for Differing Children. --There are some children who need more patient discipline and kindly training than others. They have received as a legacy unpromising traits of character, and because of this they need the more of sympathy and love. By persevering labor these wayward ones may be prepared for a place in the work of the Master. They may possess undeveloped powers, which when aroused, will enable them to fill places far in advance of those from whom more has been expected.--CT 115, 116 (1913).",
