    "word": "I appeal to our church-members to use for God the powers that He has given them. Wherever there is true conversion, there is a reformation, a consecration to God.

God's people are no longer to sit at their ease, waiting for an opening, when it is their duty to make an opening, and then go to work.--Review and Herald, Nov. 12, 1903. \n\n                                               -",
