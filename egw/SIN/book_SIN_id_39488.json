    "word": "MR No. 138 - The Election of the General Conference President\n\n     I fear that our brethren do not realize how many burdens the officers of the General Conference must bear. Many, many letters from all parts of the field come to them, asking for advice and help. Men in every part of the field think that they should certainly receive help from the General Conference. Workers who have been long in the truth freely lay their whole weight upon the president of the General Conference, sending urgent requests for means, or for his personal labors to help them in the raising of means.--Ms 68, 1904, p. 1. (\"General Conference Men Unduly Burdened,\" June 30, 1904.)",
