    "word": "If you knew God, if you were truly converted, you would not take pleasure in sinful things. The fear of God would be upon you, and as you looked to Calvary, the hateful character of transgression would be revealed to you, and you would see the great love wherewith God has loved you, and you would not have a disposition to sin. But how would it be with many of you who have dared to handle sacred things with unclean hands and with defiled souls, should the trumpet sound today. How would it be with some of you, should you be called to render up your account at the judgment seat of Christ today? I ask. What would be your condition if Christ should leave the holy place today, and probation should close, and Christ should come? That time is soon to come, though we know not the day or the hour.",
