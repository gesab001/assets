    "word": "Many have their present wants supplied; yet they will not trust the Lord for the future. They manifest unbelief and sink into despondency and gloom at anticipated want. Some are in continual trouble lest they shall come to want and their children suffer. When difficulties arise or when they are brought into strait places--when their faith and their love to God are tested--they shrink from the trial and murmur at the process by which God has chosen to purify them.\n129\nTheir love does not prove pure and perfect, to bear all things.",
