    "word": "Chap. 37 - To the Students at Battle Creek College\n\n     I have a very deep interest in the educational institution at Battle Creek. For years my husband and myself were greatly exercised in reference to establishing a school in which our youth and children should have advantages of a superior character to those found in the common public schools, or in the colleges of the world. The Lord plainly specified what should be the character of the influence and instruction the school should maintain, in order that the important work might be accomplished for which the school was designed. As the knowledge and fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, it was necessary that the study of the Bible should have a prominent place among the various branches of scientific education. The standard of the school was to be of high order, and the principles of vital godliness were ever to be kept before the students as a most essential feature of education. \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\" The youth were to be instructed in regard to the times in which we live, and to be made to understand that which will come to pass before the closing up of the world's history.",
