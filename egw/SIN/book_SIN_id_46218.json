    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has favored those who have consented to follow his plans, and he has disparaged those who have differed from him in their understanding of what constitutes medical missionary work. Of those who have not shaped their course to suit his devising, it has been declared that they are not in harmony with medical missionary work. But these assertions are not always the truth. No man has the right to attach to the work his own plans and methods, and then claim that those who do not in all things act in harmony with his ideas are not medical missionaries.",
