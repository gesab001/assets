    "word": "God has laid His hand upon all things, both man and his possessions; for all belong to Him. He says, I am the owner of the world; the universe is Mine, and I require you to consecrate to My service the first fruits of all that I, through My blessing, have caused to come into your hands. God's word declares, \"Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits.\" \"Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase.\" This tribute He demands as a token of our loyalty to Him.",
