    "word": "The Son of God came down to this earth that in Him men and women might have a representation of the perfect characters which alone God could accept. Through the grace of Christ every provision has been made for the salvation of the human family. It is possible for every transaction entered into by those who claim to be Christians to be as pure as the deeds of Christ. And the soul who accepts the virtues of Christ's character and appropriates the merits of His life is as precious in the sight of God as is His own beloved Son. Sincere and uncorrupted faith is to Him as gold and frankincense and myrrh--the gifts of the Wise Men to the Child of Bethlehem, and the evidence of their faith in Him as the promised Messiah. \n\n                                               -",
