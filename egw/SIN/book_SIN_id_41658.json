    "word": "May the Lord help you is my prayer. Now is the time to fight the good fight of faith; now is the time to wrestle against the prompting of the natural heart. Now is your time to be as true as steel to your marriage vows, refusing in thought, word, or deed, to spoil your record as a man who fears God and obeys His commandments. You have been imbibing spiritualistic ideas. But if you will now turn wholly to God, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ will be imparted to you, and truth will triumph in your life.--Letter 231, 1903, pp. 2-7. (To a prominent worker, October 5, 1903.)",
