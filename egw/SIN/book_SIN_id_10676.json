    "word": "The work will be similar to that of the day of Pentecost. As the \u201cformer rain\u201d was given, in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing of the precious seed, so the \u201clatter rain\u201d will be given at its close, for the ripening of the harvest. \u201cThen shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord; his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\u201d [Hosea 6:3.] \u201cBe glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God; for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain.\u201d [Joel 2:23.] \u201cIn the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\u201d \u201cAnd it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u201d [Acts 2:17, 21.] The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies which were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close. Here are \u201cthe times of refreshing\u201d to which the apostle Peter looked forward when he said, \u201cRepent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out [in the investigative Judgment], when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus.\u201d [Acts 3:19, 20.]",
