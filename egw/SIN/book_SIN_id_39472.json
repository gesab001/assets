    "word": "Will you please send me three of the best pens for writing, fountain pens. I like, not the very large pens, for they cannot be held by my hands since I was so long rheumatic, but ordinary size. I would not like the pens when the case unscrews in the middle, for it empties too quickly. I want one fine pen for certain purposes, durable pens, and charge to me. I have only one pen now to rely upon. I tried to get my old ones fixed, but could not here in this country. Will you please send me pens, not any of them very coarse, but pens when the ink flows readily.",
