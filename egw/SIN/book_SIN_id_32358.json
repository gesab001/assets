    "word": "The typical sacrifices and offerings of that dispensation represented Christ, who was to become the perfect offering for sinful man. Besides these mystic symbols and shadowy types pointing to a Saviour to come, there was a present Saviour to the Israelites. He it was, who, enshrouded in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, led them in their travels, and He it was who gave direct words to Moses to be repeated to the people. . . . He who was equal with the Father in the creation of man was commander, lawgiver, and guide to His ancient people.",
