    "word": "In this way we employed men who had worked at the cabinet maker's trade, carriage builders, and painters. They were in poverty and great need, and some had large families to provide for. We paid them not less than a dollar a day, and fed them. In this way we have worked to get a few acres cleared and planted in peaches, apricots, plums, pears, nectarines, apples, figs, oranges, and lemons. These trees were planted in the furrows the last of September and the first of October. The next April the entire orchard was ploughed again. By the next August, the trees were fragrant with blossoms. In November there was beautiful fruit on the peach and nectarine trees. These trees had been loaded with fruit, but most of it had been picked off when small. It was thought best for the trees to do this. With the blessing of God, by the coming November we shall have plenty of fruit.",
