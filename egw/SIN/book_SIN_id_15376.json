    "word": "Moral Independence When Opposing the World.-- Moral independence will be wholly in place when opposing the world. By conforming entirely to the will of God, we shall be placed upon vantage ground and shall see the necessity of decided separation from the customs and practices of the world. We are not to elevate our standard just a little above the world's  standard; but we are to make the line of demarcation decidedly apparent. --RH, Jan 9, 1894. (FE 289.)",
