    "word": "Although not congenial to the minister's natural inclinations, warnings are to be given, sins rebuked, and wrongs corrected.--He will have many straight and plain words to address to those who need them; for when God commissions men to do His work, He lays upon them the burden of watching for souls as they that must give an account. When needed warnings are to be given, sins are to be rebuked, errors and wrongs are to be corrected, not only in the pulpit but personal labor. This is divine work, and although it is not congenial to the natural inclinations, the minister must proclaim the straight truth which will make the ears of them that hear tingle; for they must lay\n211\nbefore those who are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, the dangers and perils that are around them, and the doom that awaits the impenitent. Because this message is not agreeable to their inclination, or welcome to those who must be warned, they are solemnly charged to be faithful in its declaration.--RH Sept. 6, 1892.",
