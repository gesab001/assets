    "word": "Christ is the source of all light and efficiency, and all the honor, all the praise, and all the gratitude offerings belong to Jesus who is the giver of every good gift. If you would be inspired with the most lofty ambition to secure the highest spiritual attainments, draw your inspiration from Jesus Christ. Glory not in self, or in success; but consecrate everything to him who has loved us, and washed us from our sin in His own most precious blood. Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary.",
