    "word": "As a member of the human family, Jesus was mortal; but as God, He was the Fountain of Life to the world. He could in His divine person have withstood the advances of death, and refused to come under its dominion. He might even in His human nature have withstood the inroads of disease, His divine nature imparting vitality and undecaying vigor to the human. But He voluntarily laid down His life that He might give life, and bring immortality to light. He must bear the sins of the world, and endure the penalty that rolled like a mountain upon His divine soul. The whole treasure of heaven was poured out in one gift to save fallen man. The Saviour brought into His human nature all the life-giving energies that human beings may need and will receive. Wondrous union of man and God!",
