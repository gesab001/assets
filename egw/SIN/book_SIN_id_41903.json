    "word": "We were hindered on the road. At Wyoming we were told there was a washout and the cars would not pass over the road until next day. We tarried at Jewel Hotel, hired a room, and engaged in writing. Next day we took the cars, rode about sixteen miles, then came to a sudden standstill. The freight cars had, in passing over the break in the road, broken through; so we waited in the cars from two o'clock until eight before the break could be repaired. I improved this time in writing. We did not reach Eagle Lake [Minnesota] until three o'clock in the morning. While waiting on the track for breakage to be repaired, the heavens gathered blackness. We had a severe storm of thunder and lightning, rain and blow. We learned this storm had spent its force before it reached us.--Letter 21a, 1875, p. 1. (To W. C. White, June 27, 1875.)",
