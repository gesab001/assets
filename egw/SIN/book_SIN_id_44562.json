    "word": "There is work to be done for every teacher in our college, from those occupying the highest position to the lowest. Not one is divested of self, not one is free from selfishness, which is exhibited in many ways. If the piety and morals of the teachers were elevated as they should be, there would be a healthier influence among the students. There is not a performing of the work of every individual with an eye single to the glory of God. There is not a looking unto Jesus and studying His life and character, but a looking to self and meeting their own defective standard.",
