    "word": "IN THEIR DETERMINATION TO DISPROVE MR. MILLER'S POSITIONS, SOME WERE READY EVEN TO JOIN WITH UNIVERSALISTS, ADOPTING INDEFINITE AND SPIRITUALIZING METHODS OF EXPOSITION, IN PLACE OF THOSE PRINCIPLES OF LITERAL INTERPRETATION WHICH ARE AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF THE PROTESTANT FAITH. OF THE ARGUMENTS BROUGHT FORWARD BY PROFESSORS STUART AND BUSH THE NEW YORK EVANGELIST SPOKE AS FOLLOWS: \u201cTHE TENDENCY OF THESE VIEWS IS TO DESTROY THE SCRIPTURE EVIDENCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF ANY REAL END OF THE WORLD, ANY DAY OF FINAL JUDGMENT, OR GENERAL RESURRECTION OF THE BODY. THE STYLE OF INTERPRETATION, WE ASSERT, TENDS FEARFULLY TO UNIVERSALISM. THIS TENDENCY WE ARE PREPARED TO PROVE.\u201d SO ALSO THE HARTFORD UNIVERSALIST SAID OF PROFESSOR STUART: \u201cHE PUTS AN UNCOMPROMISING VETO UPON THE POPULAR INTERPRETATIONS OF DANIEL AND REVELATION, AND UNITES WITH UNIVERSALISTS IN CONTENDING THAT MOST OF THEIR CONTENTS HAD SPECIAL REFERENCE TO, AND THEIR FULFILLMENT IN, SCENES AND EVENTS WHICH TRANSPIRED BUT A FEW YEARS AFTER THOSE BOOKS WERE WRITTEN.\u201d IT WAS THUS THAT POPULAR MINISTERS PREPARED THE MINDS OF THOUSANDS TO LIGHTLY REGARD THE TESTIMONY OF THE SCRIPTURES.",
