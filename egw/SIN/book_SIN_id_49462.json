    "word": "The cries of humanity from India, from Africa, from China and from many places, are going up to God. Misery and anguish and physical suffering are coming up before him, and the Lord will soon sweep the earth of its moral corruption,--not by a sea of water as in Noah's day, but by a sea of fire that can not be quenched by any human devising. Admonitions are given to the inhabitants of the earth who are corrupting their ways before God, who are plucking of the tree of the knowledge of evil to the ruin of human beings. God will avenge his own elect which cry unto him day and night. Yes, he will avenge them speedily. \n\n\n                                            Mrs. E. G. White",
