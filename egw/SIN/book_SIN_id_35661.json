    "word": "There are those who are today doing the very same things. In their counsels they venture to pronounce judgment upon the work of God; for they have become trained in doing that which the Lord has never required them to do. They would better humble their own hearts before God, and keep their hands off the ark of God, lest the wrath of God shall break forth upon them; for if God has ever spoken by men, I testify that they have undertaken a work in criticising and pronouncing unsound judgment, which I know is not right. They \n\n\n                       - 44 - \n\nare but finite men, and being befogged themselves, suppose that other men are in error.",
