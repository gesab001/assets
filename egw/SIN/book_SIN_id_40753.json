    "word": "MR No. 424 - Satan as an Angel of Light\n\n     It is those who have had the most light that Satan most assiduously seeks to ensnare. He knows that if he can deceive them, they will, under his control, clothe sin with garments of righteousness, and lead many astray. I say to all, Be on your guard; for as an angel of light Satan is walking in every assembly of Christian workers, and in every church, trying to win the members to his side. I am bidden to give to the people of God the warning, \"be not deceived; God is not mocked.\"-- Ms 15, 1908, p. 5. (\"The Need of Watchfulness,\" typed March 30, 1908.)",
