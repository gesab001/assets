    "word": "Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Christ has consecrated the grave by passing through death. The Lord Jesus broke the fetters of the tomb, and proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection, and the life.\" (John 11:25.) The grave is consecrated by his presence. Footsteps of Him that bore the cross are traceable in His life and testify of His character.--Letter 103, 1898, pp. 3, 4. (To  Sister Peck, November 21, 1898.)",
