    "word": "But I must tell you that the church in her present state is represented by the ten virgins, five of whom were wise, and five foolish.

Those represented by this class will die greater sinners than they were before they professed to believe the truth, because when they knew God, they worshipped Him not as God. Self, self, self, in all its perverted attributes, hardened the heart and closed the door against Jesus Christ, that He should not enter and abide with them.",
