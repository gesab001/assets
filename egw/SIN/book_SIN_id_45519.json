    "word": "What does that mean? It means that there may be contentions over words and over ideas, but they should be to some purpose, they should be to break down the stubbornness and the opposition that is in human hearts in order that their spirits may be softened and subdued, so that when the seeds of truth are dropped into the soil of the heart, they may take root there. We do not know which shall prosper, this or that; it is God alone that giveth the increase. Therefore we must labor in discouragements, but we want to labor in Christ. The life must be hid with Christ in God, and as the minister's labor is to watch over the flock of God as overseers, there are cautions that they are to heed: \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word\" [verse 15]. This is a great labor; it is a great burden. It is not to obtain the praise of men, it is not to look to any living mortal on the earth, but to God we are to look, with an eye single to His glory.",
