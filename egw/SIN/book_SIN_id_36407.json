    "word": "All around us souls are perishing in their sins. But how few are really burdened over the matter. The world is perishing in its misery; but this hardly moves even those who claim to believe the highest and most far-reaching truth ever given to mortals. There is a lack of that love which led Christ to leave his heavenly home, and take man's nature, that humanity might touch humanity, and draw humanity to divinity. There is a stupor, a paralysis, upon the people of God, which keeps them from understanding what is needed for this time.",
