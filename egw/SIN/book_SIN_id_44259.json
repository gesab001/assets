    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 25, 1892. Last night I spent many wakeful hours in prayer. I am resolved to cast myself, body, soul, and spirit, upon the Lord. I cannot take drugs. They do me no good, but harm. I long for the blessing of the Lord. My heart goes out after God. I tremble at His word. I am encouraged as I look to Jesus and recount His lovingkindnesses: \"In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of His temple, and my cry came before Him, even into His ears.\" \"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He delighted in me\" (Psalms 18:6, 19). \"I love the Lord, because He hath heard my voice and my supplications\" (Psalms 116:1). This has been my experience day and night during my sickness.",
