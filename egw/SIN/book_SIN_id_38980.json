    "word": "\"The study of Latin and Greek is of far less consequence to ourselves, to the world, and to God than the thorough study and use of the whole human machinery.

Never can one who is ignorant of the house we live in, have an all-around life.\"-- Youth's Instructor, April 7, 1898, art. \"The True Object of Education.\"",
