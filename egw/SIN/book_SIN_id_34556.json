    "word": "Who can measure or anticipate the gift of God? For ages, sin [has] interrupted the divine flow of benevolence to man, but that mercy and great love purchased for the fallen race has not ceased to accumulate; it has not lost its earthward direction. . . . God lives and reigns, and in Christ He has poured forth on the world a healing flood. Our Saviour has made every provision for man.--Manuscript 142, Dec. 16, 1897, \"God's Care for His Workers.\"",
