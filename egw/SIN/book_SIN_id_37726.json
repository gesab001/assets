    "word": "The school in Battle Creek should be made secure from ruthless hands, and unconsecrated minds, from men who work to bring in elements that are in no way qualified to strengthen, purify, or ennoble the institution. Let men be chosen from responsible positions who give evidence that God is using them as represented in the words, \"Ye \n                                                                           25\nare God's husbandry; ye are God's building.\" When God by his Holy Spirit works upon the character, the building is designed by no human architect, erected by no human skill. It is a building designed and fashioned by the great Master Builder. It is garrisoned by heavenly intelligences, and its foundation can never be moved.",
