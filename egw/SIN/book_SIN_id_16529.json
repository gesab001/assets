    "word": "The prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His long life was filled up with noble service for his Master. He was a man \"greatly beloved\" (Daniel 10:11) of Heaven. Yet instead of claiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself with the really sinful\n14\nof Israel as he pleaded before God in behalf of his people: \"We do not present our supplications before Thee for our righteousnesses, but for Thy great mercies.\" \"We have sinned, we have done wickedly.\" He declares: \"I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people. . . .\" (Daniel 9:18, 15, 20).",
