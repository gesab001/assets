    "word": "Jesus died to redeem him. He is the purchase of the blood of Christ. His soul is of value with God. If you can turn a sinner from the error of his ways, you have saved a soul from death. I know that many parents are in danger, through the shame and disappointment brought upon them by one of their children, to treat the erring one with greater severity than they would one who is not related to them, because then our heart has been bruised and wounded. But without Christ we are all liable to go astray, to do those things grievous in His sight, and this should make us kind and forgiving.",
