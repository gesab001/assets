    "word": "Do you ask, \u201cHow am I to abide in Christ?\u201d In the same way as you received Him at first. \u201cAs ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.\u201d Colossians 2:6. \u201cThe just shall live by faith.\u201d Hebrews 10:38. You gave yourself to God, to be His wholly, to serve and obey Him, and you took Christ as your Saviour. You could not yourself atone for your sins or change your heart; but having given yourself to God, you believe that He for Christ\u2019s sake did all this for you. By faith you became Christ\u2019s, and by faith you are to grow up in Him\u2014by giving and taking. You are to give all\u2014your heart, your will, your service\u2014give yourself to Him to obey all His requirements; and you must take all\u2014Christ, the fullness of all blessing, to abide in your heart, to be your strength, your righteousness, your everlasting helper\u2014to give you power to obey.",
