    "word": "The scenery through which we passed [ELLEN WHITE IS HERE DESCRIBING A CARRIAGE JOURNEY IN SWITZERLAND.] was altogether too majestic, too awfully grand, to give anything like a description that can compare to the scenery as it really is. The battlements of rocks--the timeworn rocky walls that have stood since the Flood, washed with the  mountain torrents--stand out smooth as if polished, while rocks  diverse from these in shape are seen in regular layers, as if art had fashioned them. Here . . . we viewed the most interesting, grand scenery that our eyes ever looked upon. The rocks ascend higher and still higher from the earth, and growing from these rocks are beautiful, dark-colored pines intermingled with the lighter and most beautiful living green of the maple and beech. . . . Such wild grandeur, such solemn scenery, carries one back to the period when the waters rose to the highest points of land, and the unbelieving antediluvians perished for their great wickedness in the waters of the Flood.",
