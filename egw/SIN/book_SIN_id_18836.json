    "word": "WHY ANSWERS TO PRAYER MAY BE DELAYED.\u2014God does not always answer our prayers the first time we call upon Him; for should He do this, we might take it for granted that we had a right to all the blessings and favors He bestowed upon us. Instead of searching our hearts to see if any evil was entertained by us, any sin indulged, we would become careless, and fail to realize our dependence upon Him, and our need of His help.\u2014(Review and Herald, June 9, 1891.)",
