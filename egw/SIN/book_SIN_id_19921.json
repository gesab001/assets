    "word": "Christ is our ideal. He has left a perfect example for childhood, youth, and manhood. He came to this earth, and passed through the different phases of human experience. In His life sin found no place. From the beginning to the close of His earthly life, He preserved unsullied His loyalty to God. The Word says of Him, \"The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.\" He \"increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.\"",
