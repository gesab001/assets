    "word": "The rabbis understood Christ\u2019s parable as applying to the publicans and sinners; but it has also a wider meaning. By the lost sheep Christ represents not only the individual sinner but the one world that has apostatized and has been ruined by sin. This world is but an atom in the vast dominions over which God presides, yet this little fallen world\u2014the one lost sheep\u2014is more precious in His sight than are the ninety and nine that went not astray from the fold.",
