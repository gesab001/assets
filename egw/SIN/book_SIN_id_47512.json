    "word": "Each human being is responsible for the salvation of his own soul, and is under the most solemn responsibility for the salvation of the souls of others. He is to exert a saving influence, he is to watch for souls as they who must give an account. Each man, woman, and youth is passing his time here as a probationer. In that great day when the accounts of all are opened, it will be known who is the foolish builder on the sand, and who the builder on the eternal Rock. Then it will be known who have dishonored God's sacred work by bringing in their own principles and practices. It will be seen who have woven their own spirit into methods and plans, to be passed on to the churches to mould their work. All the pettishness, the envy, the jealousies, the want of self-sacrifice, the stubborn resistance to the Holy Spirit's working,-all this the day will declare. Every work will be judged according to its character.",
