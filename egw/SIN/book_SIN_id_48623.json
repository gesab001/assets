    "word": "Satan is determined that men shall not see the love of God which led Him to give His only begotten Son to save a lost race; for it is the goodness of God that leads men to repentance. O how shall we succeed in setting forth before the world the deep, precious love of God? In no other way can we compass it except by exclaiming \n                                                                           154\n\"Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" 1 John 3:1. Let us say to sinners, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.\" John 1:29. By presenting Jesus as the representative of the Father, we shall be able to dispel the shadow that Satan has cast upon our pathway, in order that we shall not see the mercy and inexpressible love of God as manifested in Jesus Christ. Look at the cross of Calvary. It is a standing pledge of the boundless love, the measureless mercy of the heavenly Father.-- MS-154-1897.",
