As a tender father pities a loved but erring and rebellious son, so had Jesus compassion upon Jerusalem.

But though the sacrifices of beasts had been abundant, they could not supply the place of true sorrow for sin and obedience to God. A broken heart and contrite spirit would have been of far more value in the sight of God than multitudes of offerings without true repentance.",
