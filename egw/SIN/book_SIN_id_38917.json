    "word": "I have been shown that the Lord would have a shrewd manager in that Office; one that will reprove, and one that will not be dumb and senseless to wrongs or carelessness. He will have some one there who is sensitive to wrong, quick to feel, and who feels that the cause is a part of him, a part of his very existence. Uriah and you have not felt this as you should. When a word of admonition or even counsel is given which crosses your feelings and ideas, instead of looking closely and seeing that there was a cause for it, \n                                                                           18\nand confessing that you might be wrong, you have kept silent and considered you was suffering wrongfully, and Bro. White was censorious, exacting and severe. O Harriet, whether you realize it or not, those feelings came from a selfish, unconsecrated heart. Bro. White is not perfect. In the ardor of his feelings he may speak too strongly and if you at any time felt injured, in confidence open your mind to him; he would not be backward to relieve your mind of any burden he could. And if you and Uriah were as free to confess when you err as he has been, there would not be the trouble which now exists.",
