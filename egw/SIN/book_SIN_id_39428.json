    "word": "Nov. 3, 1885 [Tuesday]. We went on the cars twenty miles to fill an appointment at Drammen. The fog settled down so thick we could not obtain a sight of the country through which we were passing. We were two hours on the cars. We found a hall full of people at the appointed hour. The hall could only accommodate seven hundred people. The passageway was filled. All the standing room was crowded, and respectful attention was given as I addressed them from John 3:16.",
