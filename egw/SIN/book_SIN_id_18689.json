    "word": "SECRET PRAYER THE SOUL OF RELIGION.\u2014Do not neglect secret prayer, for it is the soul of religion. With earnest, fervent prayer plead for purity of soul. Plead as earnestly, as eagerly, as you would for your mortal life, were it at stake. Remain before God until unutterable longings are begotten within you for salvation, and the sweet evidence is obtained of pardoned sin.\u2014(Spiritual Gifts, bk. 2, 264.)",
