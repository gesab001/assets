    "word": "A Sad Calamity\n     A short time before we came to Stockholm, a sad calamity occurred, which cast a gloom over the entire city. Christine Neilson, the famous Swedish singer, visited Stockholm, and thousands crowded to the theater to hear her sing. But there were great numbers who could not secure admittance, and for the benefit of these she promised to sing in the open air before her hotel, at the close of her last evening's engagement. An immense crowd collected, from twenty-five to thirty thousand people. There was a bridge opposite the hotel, and as the people crowded upon this at the close of the entertainment, the cry was raised that the railing was giving way, and the people were being crowded into the water. A panic followed. In the rush to get off the bridge, men, women, and children were trampled down, eighteen persons were killed, and not less than seventy wounded.",
