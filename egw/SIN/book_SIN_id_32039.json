    "word": "1 T.--490-491 \n     I was shown that Sabbath-keepers should open a way for those of like precious faith to be benefited without their being under the necessity of expending their means at institutions where their faith and religious principles are endangered, and where they can find no sympathy or union in religious matters. God in His providence directed the course of Dr. B. to -----, that he might there obtain an experience he would not otherwise have gained, for he had a work for him to do in the health reform. As a practicing physician, he had for years been obtaining a knowledge of the human system, and God would now have him by precept and practice learn how to apply the blessings placed within the reach of man. He would have him become prepared to benefit the sick, and instruct those who do not understand how to preserve the strength and health they already have, and how to prevent disease by a wise use of heaven's remedies,--pure water, air, and diet.",
