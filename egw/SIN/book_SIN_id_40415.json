    "word": "Edson, . . .it has been told me that you were seen riding with the Walters girl. I do not charge this upon you as a grievous sin, but you are well aware that we would not approve of your showing partiality or attention to any young miss at your age. When you are old enough to begin to manifest preference for any particular one we are the ones to be consulted and to choose for you. I wish you to be carefree of your acts, not make yourself foolish and a subject of ridicule. You are but a boy yet. Will you please to remember it, and rely upon your parents' advice and instruction?--Letter 7, 1865. (To Edson White, December 13, 1865.)",
