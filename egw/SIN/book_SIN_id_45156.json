    "word": "Besides having much work to do in council meetings, I spoke in the tent three times each week, riding from North Fitzroy, seven miles and back. I spoke nine times in Melbourne. I then visited Geelong, forty miles from Melbourne, going on the boat. The company there has had little labor. We had profitable meetings. Brother Robinson conducted the Sabbath school and spoke in the morning and evening and on Sunday evening. I spoke in the afternoon both Sabbath and Sunday. These meetings were a blessing to the church. We returned to Melbourne on Monday.",
