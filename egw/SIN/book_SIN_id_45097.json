    "word": "MR No. 1565 - A Trip Across Germany and Holland to Kettering, England\n\n      (Written June 30, 1887, from Kettering, England, to \"Dear Children.\") \n\n     I wrote you last from the depot in Hamburg. We took the second class compartment, which was extra. The car was new and sweet, toilet room adjoining, and we rode from 10:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. in that car. A lady and daughter rode one half hour with us. Aside from this, we had the compartment all to ourselves. As I had slept but a trifle the night before on the boat, I slept much of the time passing through Germany and Holland.",
