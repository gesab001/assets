    "word": "I can not think that the closing part of this chapter will be your experience: \"But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, \n\n\n                      -14- \n\nand stopped their ears, that they should not hear.

Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the Lord of hosts: but I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.\"",
