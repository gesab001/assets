    "word": "While we were absent from Rochester the foreman of the Office was attacked with cholera. \n                                                                           172\nHe was an unconverted young man. The lady of the house where he boarded died with the cholera, also her daughter. He was then brought down, and no one ventured to take care of him, fearing the disease. The Office hands watched over him until the disease seemed checked, then took him to our house. He had a relapse, and a physician attended him, and exerted himself to the utmost to save him, but at length told him that his case was hopeless, that he could not survive through the night. Those interested for him could not bear to see the young man die without hope. They prayed around his bedside, while he was suffering great agony. He also prayed that the Lord would have mercy upon him, and forgive his sins. Yet he obtained no relief. He continued to cramp and toss in restless agony. The brethren continued in prayer all night, that he might be spared to repent of his sins, and keep the commandments of God.",
