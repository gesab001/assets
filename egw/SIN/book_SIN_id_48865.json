    "word": "The Loma Linda Sanitarium \n\n     I wish to present before our people the blessings that the Lord has placed within our reach by enabling us to obtain possession of the beautiful sanitarium property known as Loma Linda. This property lies sixty miles east of Los Angeles, on the main line of the Southern Pacific Railway. It's name, Loma Linda, - beautiful hill - describes the place. Of the seventy-six acres comprised in the property, about thirty-five form a beautiful hill, which rises one hundred and twenty-five feet above the valley. Upon this hill the sanitarium building is situated.",
