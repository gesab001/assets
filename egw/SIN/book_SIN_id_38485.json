    "word": "You have earnest work to do if through Christ's righteousness you win the crown of life. Oh, you must have a transformation of character before you can be a safe teacher of the truth! A profession of faith avails little without a personal, living experience in the truth. A casual or nominal faith is of no value. We must have a faith that works by love, and purifies the soul. That faith has strength; it requires on your part supreme preference, holiest love for God, reliance upon him, entire consecration, not one day in seven, but day by day. It identifies you in your feelings, your interests, your service, with Christ. Having this faith, you will be constantly receiving strength that is out of and above yourself. You will partake of the grace of God, which is without limit. When you have this communion with the divine, there is an identification of Christ's interest with yours before all the universe. Your sins are reckoned to Jesus, his righteousness is imputed to you. For God \"hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\" Thus your prayers are accepted, becoming unto God a sweet-smelling savor in the beloved. Thus you enter into his rights, and become an heir with God and joint heir with Jesus Christ. You will enter into His victories, and the reward of eternal life will be given you. \n\n\n                           [79]",
