    "word": "The Scripture should not be treated in a debating style. Those who have educated themselves as debaters have so increased their spirit of combativeness that they are ready to cavil over the Word of God, to resist and oppose everything that disagrees with their ideas or opinions. They are in their element when an opportunity is offered for them to question and criticize, for it is natural for them to be ready for battle at any time. They will play upon words, misinterpret and misstate, because this has become a settled habit with them, a second nature. Nothing is safe in their hands. Now, the Lord desires that those who are in this condition should be converted, that they become as little children--simple, meek, teachable, and Christlike.",
