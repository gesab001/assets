    "word": "In regard to the case of A, you see him as he now is and deplore his simplicity. He is without the consciousness of sin. The grace of God will remove all this hereditary, transmitted imbecility, and he will have an inheritance among the saints in light. To you the Lord has given reason. A is a child as far as the capacity of reason is concerned; but he has the submission and obedience of a child. You are a responsible member of the family. You have been redeemed by the blood of the only begotten Son of God. He gave His life for you. He bore the penalty of sin and transgression for every son and daughter of Adam that they should not perish if they believe in Him, but have everlasting life.--Letter 1, 1893, pp. 5-9. (To Sister Brown, August 4, 1893.",
