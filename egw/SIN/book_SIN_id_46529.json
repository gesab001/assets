    "word": "And when the devil comes and points to your sins and hateful crimes, tell him, \"Yes, I am a sinner, but Christ is a Saviour, and He says, 'I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance'\" [Matthew 9:13]. Thus you arm yourself with the whole armor of Christ's righteousness? How is it you have not on the armor of Christ's righteousness? What did He come to this world for? Why, if it had been a possible thing for us to have been brought back to keeping God's commandments, He never would have come to this world; but He came here because it was impossible for man to redeem himself and bring himself into a position where Adam stood before the fall. Then what was he to do? Christ came, our substitute and surety.",
