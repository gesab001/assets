    "word": "While attending the General Conference at Oakland, the Lord instructed me that Brethren Sutherland and Magan should be relieved from some of the financial burdens they were carrying. They have used much of their time and strength in the effort to decrease and, if possible, wipe out the heavy indebtedness on the Battle Creek College,--a debt for the creating of which others were responsible. Those who were more directly responsible should labor to relieve their brethren at Berrien Springs of this burden. They should place themselves in the position of these pioneers who were under constant pressure to pay obligations they had not incurred,--pioneers who had by faith left Battle Creek, and who now are building up a school that God can approve. Too long the burden has rested on our brethren at Berrien Springs. They have kept their gracious intentions in view, devoting themselves to the task of clearing the old College property from debt. How pleasing to God it would be for all our people to share in lifting the obligations of the old Battle Creek College!",
