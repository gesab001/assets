    "word": "After a time, the Lord removes His blessings from those who praise their own aptness and wisdom. Their weakness in judgment will be as marked as was the strength with which they were formerly endowed. To God belongs all the glory for the wise and good deeds of human agencies. When it is too late to escape the sure result of their course of action, many men will weep because of the evils that they have brought upon themselves.--Ms 146, 1902. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nJanuary 11, 1990. Entire Ms.",
