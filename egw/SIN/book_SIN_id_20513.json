I have passed over the ground that you are now traveling, and know what it means.  How much sorrow there is in our world!  How much grief!  How much weeping!  It is not right to say to the bereaved ones, \"Do not weep; it is not right to weep.\"  Such words have little consolation in them.  There is no sin in weeping.  Although the one who passes away has been for years a sufferer because of weakness and pain, yet that does not wipe away the tears from our eyes.",
