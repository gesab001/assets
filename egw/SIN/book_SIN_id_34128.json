    "word": "There is no one, however earnestly he may be striving to do his best, who can say, \"I have no sin.\" He who would say this would be under a dangerous deception. \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us\" (1 John 1:8). How then can we escape the charge, \"Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting\"? We are to look to Christ. At infinite cost, He has covenanted to be our representative in the heavenly courts, our Advocate before God.--Manuscript 23, Feb. 8, 1906, \"A God of Knowledge by Whom Actions Are Weighed.\"",
