    "word": "\"As you seek to reach the highest standard, I will turn my hands upon thee and will purge away thy dross, and take away thy sin. I will melt and try them. Put off concerning the former conversation of the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. You are to be one. Strive no longer to be first. If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Read the first twelve verses of the second chapter of First Peter. God gave these words through his servant. Let all help their brethren to be one as Christ is one with the Father.",
