    "word": "Moses saw that only through Jesus Christ could man keep the law of God. Paul says, \"The commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto \n\n\n                                  -330- \n\ndeath\" (Romans 7:10)--death to the sinner. The types and ceremonies, with the prophecies, gave ancient believers a veiled or indistinct discovery of the mercy and grace to be brought to light through the revelation of Jesus Christ to our world. The law itself would have no glory were it not that Christ is embodied in it. The revelation of Jesus Christ cast its glory back into the Jewish age. The law had no power to save. It was lusterless, except as Christ was represented in the law as the One full of righteousness and truth. And when Christ was revealed in His advent to our world, and died man's sacrifice, type met antitype. Then the glory of that which is not typical, not to be done away, but which remaineth, God's law of ten commandments, the standard of righteousness was plainly discerned as immutable by all who saw to the end of that which was abolished.",
