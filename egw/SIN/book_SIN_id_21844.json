I THINK YOU WILL DISCERN THE REASONABLENESS OF THIS PROPOSITION. A PRESBYTERIAN WHO WAS ENDEAVORING TO PROVE THE SOUNDNESS OF HIS THEORIES TO A CONGREGATION OF METHODISTS WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO DEPEND LARGELY UPON PRESBYTERIAN WRITERS TO PROVE HIS POINTS, NOR WOULD A METHODIST WHO WAS ENDEAVORING TO CONVINCE A BAPTIST OF THE SOUNDNESS OF THE METHODIST RELIGION, MAKE THE GREATEST HEADWAY BY USING METHODIST WRITERS AS HIS AUTHORITY. IN ALL OUR WORK WE MUST STUDY TO FOLLOW METHODS THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE.",
