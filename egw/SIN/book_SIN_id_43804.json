    "word": "Charged with an embassage of mercy, love, and pardon, Christ came to His own, but His own received Him not. He was buffeted by temptation, and bruised and lacerated by the cruel lash. He was crowned with thorns, and His hands and feet pierced by nails. In His dying agony on the cross He was scorned by the people who claimed to be waiting for the Messiah, but who by their actions showed the value of their spirituality. Surely Christ has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Surely He was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities. But did not Satan understand that while he was bruising the heel of the Son of God, the Son of God was bruising his head? \n\n\n                                  -75-",
