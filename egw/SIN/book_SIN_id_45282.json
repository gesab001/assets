    "word": "MR No. 1598 - Medical and Ministerial Workers Should Harmonize\n\n     (Written May 15, 1907, from Loma Linda, California, to P. T. Magan.) \n\n     I pray that the Lord's blessing may rest upon you. Your work has been made disagreeable and difficult because of the attitude of some of your brethren. The Lord has not prompted these things that are of a discouraging nature. I have written to you in harmony with the light that I have received for years, but I ask you not to use this in a way that might be injudicious. I feel assured that you will act with proper discretion in this matter.",
