    "word": "MR No. 344 - The 1888 Experience\n\n     I am distressed beyond any words my pen can trace. Unmistakably, Elder G [a responsible General Conference Worker] has acted as did Aaron, in regard to these men [A. R. Henry and Harmon Lindsay] who have been opposed to the work of God ever since the Minneapolis meeting. They have not repented of their course of action in resisting light and evidence. Long ago I wrote to A. R. Henry, but not a word of response has come from him to me. I have recently written to Harmon Lindsay and his wife, but I suppose he will not respect the matter sufficiently to reply.--Letter 100, 1896. (To O. A. Tait, August 26, 1896.) \n\nReleased October 31, 1973.",
