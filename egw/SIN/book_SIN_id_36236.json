    "word": "Humility, self-denial, benevolence, and the payment of a faithful tithe, these show that the grace of God is working in the heart. The greatest Teacher, the greatest Physician the world has ever known, gave many lessons on the need of humility. These lessons His followers are to bring into the practical life. They are to live lives of self-denial and self-sacrifice. To many this will be a new experience, but on it their salvation depends. \"He that will come after me,\" Christ said, \"Let him deny himself and take up his cross, \n                                                                           21\nand follow me.\" Following Christ produces the virtues of Christ's character. Humility is a precious grace, peculiarly pleasing to God. Christ says, \"Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Those who follow Christ will overcome temptation, and will receive the glorious reward of eternal life. And to Christ they will render all the praise and glory.",
