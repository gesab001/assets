    "word": "Christ, the Son of God, was appointed by the Father to come to this world as the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and great Medical Missionary. He was not only to heal the sick, but was also to take away sin and raise the dead. He came as the Life-giver. How much He will be to those in our medical institutions who truly believe in Him as the Great Healer! How much He will do for the sick and suffering who come to these institutions, if the physicians and nurses point them to Him as the Life-giver, telling them that if they will commit themselves to His keeping, He will take away their suffering of mind, and give them rest and peace!",
