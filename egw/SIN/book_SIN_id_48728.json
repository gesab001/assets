    "word": "My heart aches when I consider the stubborn resistance on the part of some to the truth we have held for half a century. Night after night I can not sleep. My soul is bowed down with heavy burdens when I consider that some of my old friends, and some of my own relatives are refusing to walk in the light that God is sending by His Holy Spirit. O that the searcher of hearts would arouse these souls to realize their true condition. I call to mind the trial that Christ was called to endure when He was rejected by the members of His own family. \"Neither did His own brethren believe in Him,\" - this must have been one of the cruelest of His many trials.",
