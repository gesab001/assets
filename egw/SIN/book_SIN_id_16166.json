    "word": "The light of prophecy still burns for the guidance of souls, saying, \"This is the way, walk ye in it.\" It shines on the pathway of the just to commend, and on the way of the unjust to lead to repentance and conversion. Through its agency sin will be rebuked and iniquity unmasked. It is progressive in the performance of its duty to reflect light on the past, the present, and the future.",
