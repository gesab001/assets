    "word": "As far as possible, it is well to consider what is to be accomplished through the day. Make a memorandum of the different duties that await your attention, and set apart a certain time for the doing of each duty. Let everything be done with thoroughness, neatness, and dispatch. If it falls to your lot to do chamber work, then see that the rooms are well aired, and that the bed clothing is exposed to the sunlight. \n\n\n                                 -79- \n\nGive yourself a number of minutes to do the work, and do not stop to read papers and books that take your eye, but say to yourself, \"No, I have just so many minutes in which to do my work, and I must accomplish my task in a given time.\" If the room is decorated with little ornaments, and you would have an eye single to the glory of God, let these little idols be stored away; but if this can not be done and these ornaments must be exposed to your admiration, then handle them expeditiously. Do not take them up, one after another, as you dust them, dream over each one, and hesitate and admire, keeping it in your hand as though you were loath to replace it. Let those who are naturally slow of movement, seek to become active, quick energetic, remembering the words of the Apostle, \"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\"",
