    "word": "The Anger of Moses.--The breaking of the tables of stone was but a representation of the fact that Israel had broken the covenant which they had so recently made with God. It is a righteous indignation against sin, which springs from zeal for the glory of God, not that anger prompted by self-love or wounded ambition, which is referred to in the scripture \"Be ye angry, and sin not.\" Such was the anger of Moses.--RH, Feb 18, 1890. (TM 101.)",
