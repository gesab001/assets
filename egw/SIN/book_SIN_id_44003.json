    "word": "Jesus suffered the extreme penalty of the law for our transgressions, and justice was fully satisfied. The law is not abrogated; it has lost not one jot of its force. Instead, it stands forth in holy dignity, Christ's death on the cross testifying to its immutability. Its demands have been met, its authority maintained. God spared not His only begotten Son. To show the depth of His love for man, He delivered Him up for us all. \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Behold Him dying on the cross. Behold Him who was equal with God, mocked and derided by the mob. Behold Him in Gethsemane, bowed under the burden of the sins of the whole world.",
