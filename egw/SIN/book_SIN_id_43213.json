    "word": "To Every Man God Has Given His Work. There is no such thing as a loveless Christian. He who is in unity with Christ, in word, in life, and action, bears the living testimony that he has the mind and Spirit of Christ. Those who are truly the followers of Christ love as brethren, and are the salt of the earth, the light of the world. Every true believer catches the bright beams from the Morning Star, and transmits the light to those who sit in darkness. Not only do they shine amid the darkness in their own neighborhoods, but as a church they go forth to regions beyond. The Lord expects every man to do his duty. Everyone who unites with the church is to be one with Christ, diffusing the bright beams of the Morning Star and becoming the light of the world. Christ and His people are to be co-partners in the great work of saving the world.",
