    "word": "In regard to the charges of my introducing and engaging in the fanaticism of creeping, I will state, in the fear of God, I never crept as a religious duty, and never sanctioned or gave the slightest encouragement to this voluntary humility. I ever bore the testimony God gave me that He did not require this groveling exercise of His children. I was shown and told them this, that the Word of God contained close tests and duties which were of a character to elevate, and recommended them to the good judgment and \n\n\n                                    -230- \n\nconsciences of His sincere children. But these acts of voluntary humility taken up by some inconsistent fanatical ones, who were ever going to extremes, had a bad influence upon honest souls who wanted to be right and humble and who submitted to groveling acts, which brought a reproach upon the cause of God. Duties were made by men, tests manufactured that God had never required, and which found no sanction in His Word. I state definitely I never crept when I could walk, and have ever opposed it. I was shown in vision, after I refused to accept this as a duty, that it was not a requirement of God, but the fruit of fanaticism. Because I would not condescend to these fanatical, man-made tests to humble us, I was accused of being proud and like the world, shunning the cross, not willing to humble myself.",
