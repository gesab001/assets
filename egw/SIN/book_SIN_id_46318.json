    "word": "This great and solemn work is not to be carried to  its completion by a few men who have been selected as opportunity has offered, to bear responsibility. There are some minds which do not grow with the work, but allow the work to grow far beyond them, and they find themselves tired and worn before they comprehend the circumstances. Then when those whom God is qualifying to assist in the work, take hold of it in a little different way from that in which these responsible men have tried to do it, they should be very careful not to hinder these helpers, or to circumscribe the work. Since they did not see the work in all its bearings, and did not have the burden which God has specially laid upon others, why should they say just how that work should be done? Those who do not discern and adapt themselves to the increasing demands of the work, should not stand blocking the wheels, and thus hindering the advancement of others.",
