    "word": "I wish my position to be clearly understood. I have no sympathy with the course that has been pursued toward Bro. Bell. Some members of the church had a wrong spirit when Bro. Bell first came to Battle Creek. He did not take favorably with them. He was, they said, too thorough, too exacting, too critical. The feeling of opposition to him, rose to such a height that the Lord vindicated his servant, and reproved the spirit that was manifested against him. Since then, Bro. Bell's course has from time to time been shown me in vision. For some things he has been reproved, in other things I have been shown that he was unjustly censured, and I have reproved those whose lax ideas of discipline led to their complaints. In the last vision given me, I was shown that in some respects Bro. Bell's course in the school-room was not right. The influence was not such as God could approve. This matter was plainly presented before him and before the teachers and others connected with the school. I have not refrained from reproving wrongs in him when the Spirit of God has bidden me to speak. I have been shown that every deviation from the right, every act of hardness, or severity, has been a great injury to himself. It has alienated the affections of his students, and given his accusers occasion to justify their course.",
