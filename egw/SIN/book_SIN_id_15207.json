    "word": "Partaker of Sin Through Association.--The soul that has been misled by wrong influences and has become a partaker of sin through association with others, to do contrary to the mind and character of God, need not despair. \"For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens\" (Hebrews 7:26). Christ is not only priest and intercessor for our sins, but the offering. He offered Himself once for all.--Lt 11, 1897.",
