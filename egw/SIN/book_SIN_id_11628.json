    "word": "Chapter V. - Blessings from Obeying Natural Law.\n\n     61. Those who understand something of the wisdom and beneficence of his laws, and perceive the evidences of God's love and the blessings that result from obedience, will come to regard their duties and obligations from an altogether different point of view. Instead of looking upon the observance of the laws of health as a matter of sacrifice and self-denial, they will regard it, as it really is, an inestimable blessing. -- C. T., p. 120.",
