    "word": "In the great work of the Lord a diversity of gifts is called for. Let no man turn from a fellow worker because he does not work in his precise lines, saying, We have no need of you. God uses many gifts to convict and convert sinners, and to gather them together in church capacity. All the different gifts He has bestowed on His people are needed in His work.",
