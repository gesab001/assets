    "word": "-300- \n\n     While Christ was hanging in agony on the cross, one of the thieves that at first railed on Him repented, and said to Him, \"Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee today, thou shalt be with Me in Paradise\" [Luke 23:42, 43]. Satan then trembled for his kingdom. He knew it would be destroyed. Jesus had withstood all his temptations. He had patiently endured cruel persecution, and now with a note of triumph in His voice, He could promise salvation to a poor repentant sinner.",
