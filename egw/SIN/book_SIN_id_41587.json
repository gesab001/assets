    "word": "MR No. 795 - Walk in the Light of the Cross\n\n     I had a wonderful dream last night or this morning: A few persons had assembled and were conversing together as to how the work should be carried on in this country, when there is such a dearth of means with which to advance it. We seemed as sheep in the midst of wolves. We offered up tearful prayers. Our hope and courage and faith were severely tested and tried. We could not see how we could advance the very work that we were very anxious to do, and which the Lord was impressing upon us should be done.",
