    "word": "God\u2019s word sanctions no policy that will enrich one class by the oppression and suffering of another. In all our business transactions it teaches us to put ourselves in the place of those with whom we are dealing, to look not only on our own things, but also on the things of others. Those who would take advantage of another\u2019s misfortunes in order to benefit themselves, or who seek to profit themselves through another\u2019s weakness or incompetence, are transgressors both of the principles and of the precepts of the Word of God.",
