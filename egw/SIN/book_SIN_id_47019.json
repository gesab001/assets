    "word": "Some may say, \"I have done the best I can do.\" Perhaps you have, because you can, of yourself, do no good. You must depend, in living, active, persevering faith upon Jesus Christ. You can shun responsibilities, you can take yourselves still farther away from the channel of light, you can breathe the worldly atmosphere and become purely worldly businessmen. But will it pay? You cannot think so, with eternity in view. Will a separation from the work take you away from temptation? No! Every man who accepts responsibilities must not accept so many that he cannot take time to seek the wisdom which the Lord alone can give him. The Spirit of the Lord will do more for you in your work than you can do in your lifetime without His Holy Spirit.",
