    "word": "Parents want to teach their children of Jesus and fit them, not for the pleasures of this world, but for the future, immortal life. And what are we doing? Are we fitting them for the future, immortal home, or are the pleasures of this world of more value? He will ask you soon, \"Where are the children that I have given you? Have you fitted them for the world above?\" What will you say then? Every mouth will be closed. God has given us reason and intellect. Give them to Him. Our affections are to be given to God. Your time belongs to God; He has bought it. Soon the question will come to us, \"What have you done with the blessings I have given you?\" What you want is to grasp every ray of light that is given you from heaven, and live by that light. Then you will be happy.",
