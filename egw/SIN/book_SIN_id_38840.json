    "word": "The Lord requires all in the Office to labor from high motives. Christ has, in his life, given them examples. All should labor with interest, devotion, and faith, for the salvation of souls. If every one in the Office will labor with unselfish purposes, discerning the sacredness of the work, the blessing of God will rest upon them. If all had cheerfully and gladly taken up their several burdens, the wear and perplexity would not have come so heavily upon my husband. How few earnest prayers have been sent up to God in faith for those who were not fully in the truth who worked in the Office. Who has felt the worth of the soul \n                                                                           21\nfor whom Christ died? Who have been laborers in the vineyard of the Lord? I saw that angels were grieved with the trifling frivolities of the professed followers of Christ in that Office, who were handling sacred things. Some have no more sense of the sacredness of the work than if they were engaged in common labor. God now calls for the fruitless cumberers of the ground to consecrate themselves to him, and center their affections and hopes in him.",
