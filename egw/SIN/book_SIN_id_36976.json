    "word": "Eld. White and Dr. Kellogg have not given themselves proper rest. God instituted the Sabbath as a day of rest to repair nature's exhausted energies. No mind can continue day after day without cessation, either in business which taxes the mental powers, or in the acquirement of knowledge, without injury. There is no night in Heaven. There is no wear and weariness of the human machinery. There we shall never be sensible of fatigue; never need or want repose. There is no tire in performing God's will; we shall never be wearied in sounding his praise. We shall always have the freshness of the morning. But as we are now in this world, with bodies which weary, we must pay heed to God's plans, and take repose when we need it. \n                                                                           40",
