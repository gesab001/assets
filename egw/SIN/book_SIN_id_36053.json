    "word": "God calls upon those who act a part in his service not to block the way of advance by selfishly using in one place or in one line of work all the means they can secure. In all parts of the world there is a work to be done that ought to have been done long ago. God forbid that you should make appeals to the people for means to complete the new Sanitarium in Battle Creek, when you already have many buildings in your possession, and when you have thousands of dollars in sight.
