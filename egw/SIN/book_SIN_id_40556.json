    "word": "Let God's workmen feel that every hour they are in need of divine guidance. Those who have not been looking to Jesus, inquiring, \"Is this the way of the Lord?\" should commence at once to do this. We are daily to realize that God has given us a part in his great work, and that he expects us to act intelligently. We are not to try to get up something new and singular, something odd and strange, in order to create a sensation. We are to be perfectly content to give the instruction Christ has given.",
