    "word": "Great light was given to the Reformers, but many of them received the sophistry of error through misinterpretation of the Scriptures. These errors have come down through the centuries, but although they be hoary with age, yet they have not behind them a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" For the Lord has said, I will not \"alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.\" In his great mercy the Lord has permitted still greater light to shine in these last days. To us he has sent his message, revealing his law and showing us what is truth.",
