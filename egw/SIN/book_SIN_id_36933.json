    "word": "\"When I look over our life of travel and warfare for the past thirty-five years, and see how wonderfully we have been preserved from accident and harm, it awes and humbles me, under a sense of my obligations to God. We have been on the cars when fatal accidents have occurred, and the Lord's mercy has preserved us, so that life and limb have been uninjured. This appears to me in a new light. A prominent man, in conversing with me of our extensive travels, with no serious accident, once remarked, 'Eld. White, yours seems to be a charmed life.' I answered, 'The God \n                                                                           50\nwhom I serve has given his angels charge over me, and until my work is done, he will preserve me.'\"",
