    "word": "MR No. 423 - Appreciation of Marian Davis\n\n     I feel very thankful for the help of Sister Marian Davis in getting out my books. She gathers material from my diaries, from my letters, and from the articles published in the papers. I greatly prize her faithful service. She has been with me for twenty-five years, and has constantly been gaining increasing ability for the work of classifying and grouping my writings. --Letter 9, 1903. p. 1. (To Elder and Mrs. John Burden, January 6, 1903.) \n\nReleased April 16, 1975.",
