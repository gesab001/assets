    "word": "It is very important to know whom we are following. There are precious victories for us to gain. \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" [Matthew 16:24.] But how apt men are to shrink from the reproach that the truth will bring and then be led to disobey the requirements of God. There have been those in the past who have suffered for the truth's sake. It was to them dearer than life, and men lost their lives to gain eternal life. It will not be surprising if we have to suffer, if we are tried. When these trials come, it may be on account of temporal things, but we must not allow the things of this life to govern us. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" [Matthew 6:33.] If we are sanctified through the truth, then we shall let nothing come between us and our duty to God. \"What is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\" [Matthew 16:26.] There are many who exchange their souls for this life. But what is a man profited if he should gain this world? For he cannot have this world and the one to come. \n\n\n                                    -259-",
