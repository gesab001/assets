    "word": "Jesus is a risen Saviour. He is our Advocate in the heavenly courts. As soon as the sinner sees his sin in the light of God's Word, and repents, seeking with contrition of soul for pardon, the Lord hears and answers. The clearer our view of Jesus, the clearer is our view of our own weakness. Those who behold Him realize their inability to do anything good without His help. They say, \"In my hands no price I bring; simply to Thy cross I cling.\" They bow in adoration \n\n\n                                   -143- \n\nbefore God at the thought of the wonderful provision made to take away the sin of the world.",
