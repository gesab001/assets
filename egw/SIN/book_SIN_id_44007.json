    "word": "The love existing between the Father and His Son cannot be portrayed. It is measureless. In Christ God saw the beauty and perfection of excellence that dwells in Himself. Wonder, O heavens, and be astonished. O earth, for God spared not His own Son, but gave Him up to be made sin for us, that those who believe may be made the righteousness of God in Him. \"God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\"",
