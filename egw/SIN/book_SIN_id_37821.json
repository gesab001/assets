    "word": "No one should be allowed to engage in the sacred work who could be bought or sold for money. No one is to take advantage of any man's ignorance or necessity, in order to charge exorbitant prices for work done or for goods sold. The managers are not obeying the commandments of God when, by any selfish devising, they secure the benefits of the time or talents of the workmen. Such a course is robbery of your neighbor. God has given every one of his workers certain qualifications, for which he is responsible, not to any man or set of men, but to God. He is so to use them that they will be a blessing to himself, by having it in his power to be a blessing to others. The practises that have prevailed in the Review and Herald office, and which are now leavening the managers of the conferences, are not correct. I can not specify all the departures from righteousness; \n\n\n                     -17- \n\nthey are too many to be enumerated, and I am not told to do this.",
