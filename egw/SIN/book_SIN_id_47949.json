TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT WE ORGANIZE A BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE COLLEGE, OPERATING UNDER THE NAME OF THE HEALDSBURG COLLEGE FOOD COMPANY, OR SOME SIMILAR NAME, AND THAT INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH AGENTS OR GROCERY-MEN, WE SELL TO OUR PEOPLE DIRECT AT A NET RATE. WE HAVE DISCUSSED MORE OR LESS THE QUESTION OF HOW THE FOOD COMPANY SHOULD CONNECT WITH THE COLLEGE--WHETHER WE SHOULD ASK THE COLLEGE TO CONDUCT THIS BUSINESS UPON PLANS WHICH WE COULD APPROVE, OR WHETHER THE FOOD COMPANY SHOULD CONDUCT THE BUSINESS ON PLANS WHICH THE COLLEGE COULD APPROVE; OR WHETHER THE TWO SHOULD UNITE HAND IN HAND IN A PARTNERSHIP.",
