    "word": "Pharaoh desired to justify his stubbornness in resisting the divine command, and hence he was seeking some pretext for disregarding the miracles that God had wrought through Moses.

Satan hoped also to shake the faith of Moses and Aaron in the divine origin of their mission.\u2014PP 263, 264.",
