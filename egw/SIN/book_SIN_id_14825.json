    "word": "Medical Missions in Every City \n\n     Intemperance has filled our world, and medical missions should be established in every city. By this I do not mean that expensive institutions should be established, calling for a large outlay of means. These missions are to be conducted in such a way that they will not be a heavy drain on the cause; and their work is to prepare the way for the establishment of present truth. Medical missionary work should have its representative in every place in connection with the establishment of our churches. The relief of bodily suffering opens the way for the healing of the sin-sick soul.--MS. 88, 1902.",
