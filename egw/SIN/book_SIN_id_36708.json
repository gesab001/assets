    "word": "Tracts show that in the medical profession there are many skeptics and atheists. When they enter the school of science they exalt the works of God above the God of science, and the grossness of the mind fails to comprehend God. There are but few who enter \n\n\n                        -27- \n\nmedical colleges that come out of them pure and unspotted. Their minds become gross in place of being elevated, ennobled, sanctified. Material things eclipse the heavenly, the eternal. It is the privilege of every student to enter college with the same fixed, determined principle that Daniel had when he entered the courts of Babylon, and to preserve his integrity untarnished. You all need a living religion, that you may stand as God's witnesses, proclaiming to the sick that sin is always followed with suffering; and while combating pain and disease, you should plainly lay before them that which you know to be the real cause, and the remedy. Cease to sin, and point them to the sin-pardoning Saviour.",
