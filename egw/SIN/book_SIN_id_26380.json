    "word": "\"As the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\" The drunkenness and the crime that now prevail, have been foretold by the Saviour Himself.

Everything betokens the soon return of our Lord.--Review and Herald, Oct. 25, 1906. \n                                                                           26",
