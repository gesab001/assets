    "word": "Well, now these words are precious in the sight of God, and he wants every one of us to educate ourselves in the faculty of the Spirit that is to circulate in the heavenly court when we shall enter there. And we must circulate that spirit here, or we will never enter there. What we want is righteousness and truth and the glory that God will bestow upon the ones that are diligently seeking in the right way to serve God that they may obtain Christ's righteousness. And in that way we shall find that our homes will be pleasant. Why, fathers and mothers have no right to be scolding and fretting with their children in their homes. It is a sin. We are fitting up - what for? The heavenly mansions. And we can teach it to our children that we can have no words, no crossness, we can have no quarreling in our house because that will send the angels of God away. We want the angels of God to fit us up that we may inherit the kingdom prepared for us from the foundation of the world.",
