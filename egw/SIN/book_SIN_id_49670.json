    "word": "Infinite possibilities are placed within the reach of every human being who in humility and contrition returns to his allegiance to God, as a little child acknowledging the authority of his law, and obeying its precepts. The Father and the Son have provided for man great things, broad and high and deep and inexpressible. This they have done that man, becoming one with Christ in God, might trade on his talents to advance the kingdom of heaven in this world. But man, choosing the kingship, will, in pursuance of his object, reveal what self will do by its devising, setting aside the only One to whom belongs the kingship, who is the alpha and omega of all things, besides whom there is none else.",
