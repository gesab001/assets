    "word": "\"In doing the Lord's work, we are to stand on the foundation on which the truth has always been based. God's foundation is sure, and all are to stand on it and work from this platform.

It is the work of every Christian to strive to be a laborer \n\n\n                               -75- \n\ntogether with God.\"",
