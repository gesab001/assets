    "word": "Nov. 4, 1885. We left Drammen at eight o'clock for Christiania. It was raining, but the fog had cleared away so that we could see the country through which the cars were passing. The scenery is very fine. The country is broken. There are high bluffs and rocky mountains, lakes and islands. In summer this would be a very pleasant place to live in. Spoke Wednesday night in the hall, which was well filled. I spoke from Luke 10:25-29.",
