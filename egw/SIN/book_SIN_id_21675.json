    "word": "Refining the Tastes \n\n     Truth never makes men or women coarse, or rough or uncourteous. It takes men in all their sin and commonness, separates them from the world, and refines their tastes, even if they are poor and uneducated. Under Christ's discipline, a constant work of refinement goes on, sanctifying them through the truth. If they are tempted to exert one particle of influence that would lead away from Christ into the way of the world, in pride, or fashion, or display, they speak words of resistance that will turn aside the enemy's power. \"I am not my own,\" they say. \"I am bought with a price. I am a son, a daughter of God.\"--Letter 26, 1900.",
