    "word": "Spiritualism asserts that men are unfallen demigods; that \"each mind will judge itself\"; that \"true knowledge places men above all law\"; that \"all sins committed are innocent\"; for \"whatever is, is right,\" and \"God doth not condemn.\" The basest of human beings it represents as in heaven, and highly exalted there....
