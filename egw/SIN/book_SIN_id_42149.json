    "word": "MR No. 945 - O. A. Olsen Materials\n\n     We have a work to do if we would be a living church. Individually and as a whole we are to tread sin under our feet. Our habits, our conversations, our daily life, must be placed on the Lord's side. We must intercede and wrestle with a covenant-keeping God in behalf of His watchmen, that souls may be won to the Saviour.",
