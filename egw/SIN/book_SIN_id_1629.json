    "word": "Satan with his fierce temptations wrung the heart of Jesus. The Saviour could not see through the portals of the tomb. Hope did not present to Him His coming forth from the grave a conqueror, or tell Him of the Father\u2019s acceptance of the sacrifice. He feared that sin was so offensive to God that Their separation was to be eternal. Christ felt the anguish that the sinner will feel when mercy shall no longer plead for the guilty race. It was the sense of sin, bringing the Father\u2019s wrath upon Him as the sinner\u2019s substitute, that made the cup He drank so bitter, and broke the heart of the Son of God.\u2014Ibid., p. 753.",
