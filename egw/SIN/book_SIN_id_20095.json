    "word": "We cannot use the Holy Spirit; the Spirit is to use us. Through the Spirit, God works in His people \"to will and to do of his good pleasure\" (Philippians 2:13). But many will not submit to be led. They want to manage themselves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is given according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul according to the capacity to receive.",
