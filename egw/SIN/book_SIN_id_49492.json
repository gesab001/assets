    "word": "Everything is to be done that can be done to enlarge the sphere of Christian influence. Christ's church members are to work earnestly for those who are perishing in their sins. Let the church prayer meetings be a source of spiritual life, a place where the members of the church may learn to work in spiritual lines. Let all enter upon the Lord's work with sanctified earnestness. Let those who in the past have been merely consumers, now become producers. Let the Lord's people bring their gifts and offerings for the furtherance of his work. Thus the kingdom of God will be greatly extended.",
