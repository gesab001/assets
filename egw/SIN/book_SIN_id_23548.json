    "word": "The apparently dry branch, by being connected with the living vine, becomes a part of it. . . . The soul, dead in trespasses and sins, must experience a similar process. . . . As the graft receives life when united to the vine, so the sinner partakes of the divine nature when connected with Christ. Finite man is united with the infinite God. When thus united, the words of Christ abide in us, and we are not actuated by a spasmodic feeling, but a living, abiding principle. \n                                                                           292",
