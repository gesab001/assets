    "word": "Bro. Salisbury should move cautiously, that he may not become embarrassed in business. His brother, W. S., has a lesson to learn in economy. He and his wife have unitedly a reformation to make in this direction. The lesson Christ gave to his disciples they should take home and practice: \"Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost.\" They might have saved much by economy, that has been wasted by prodigality. They must learn that they will have to render an account for every dollar wasted; for it is the Lord's money.",
