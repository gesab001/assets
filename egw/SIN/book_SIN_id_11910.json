    "word": "There have been times since the third angel's message was first proclaimed, when angels in the form of human beings have appeared to men, and conversed with them as they did with Abraham of old. When the complaints of Satan are entered against the servants \n157\nof God, angels are often sent down to investigate their course, sometimes conversing with men unbeknown to them. They sometimes question those in error, until they tell all that is in their hearts, and then these angels bear their report back to heaven, relating things just as they exist.",
