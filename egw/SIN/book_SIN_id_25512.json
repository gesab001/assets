    "word": "God then charged Moses to make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither they should go, lest they should be insnared thereby. But they should destroy their idol altars, break their images, and cut down their groves, which were dedicated to their idols, and where the people assembled to hold their idolatrous feasts, given in honor of their idol gods. He then said to them, \"Thou shalt worship no other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.\" God claims, as his due, supreme worship. He gave special directions in regard to his Sabbath. \"Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest. In earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.\" The Lord knows that Satan is continually at work to lead his people to transgress the law of God, and he condescended to be very definite in his directions to his erring people, that they might not err, and transgress his commandments for want of knowledge. He knew that in the busiest season of the year, when their fruits and grains \n                                                                           293\nwere to be secured, they would be tempted to transgress the Sabbath, and labor on sacred time. He would have them understand that their blessings would be increased or diminished according to their integrity of soul, or unfaithfulness in his service.",
