    "word": "After His resurrection, Christ ascended to heaven, and He is today presenting our needs to the Father. \"I have graven them upon the palms of My hands,\" He says. It cost something to engrave them there. It cost untold agony. If we would humble ourselves before God, and be kind and courteous and tender-hearted and pitiful, there would be one hundred conversions to the truth where now there is only one. But though professing to be converted, we carry round with us a bundle of self that we regard as altogether too precious to be given up. It is our privilege to lay this burden at the feet of Christ, and in its place take the character and similitude of Christ. The Saviour is waiting for us to do this.",
