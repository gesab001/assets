    "word": "Now Christ is in the heavenly sanctuary. And what is He doing? Making atonement for us, cleansing the sanctuary from the sins of the people. Then we must enter by faith into the sanctuary with Him, we must commence the work in the sanctuary of our souls. We are to cleanse ourselves from all defilement. We must \"cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\" Satan will come and tempt you and you will give way to his temptations. What then? Why, come and humble your hearts in confession, and by faith grasp the arm of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. Believe that Christ will take your confession and hold up His hands before the Father--hands that have been bruised and wounded in our behalf-- and He will make an atonement for all who will come with confession. What if you cannot understand about this matter? He says, \"He that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins\" (2 Peter 1:19).",
