    "word": "Corinth was one of the leading cities, not only of Greece, but of the world. Situated upon a narrow neck of land between two seas, it commanded the trade of both the east and the west.

Corinth was now more prosperous than Athens, which had once taken the lead.

Athens was the acknowledged center of art and learning; Corinth, the seat of government and trade.",
