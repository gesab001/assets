    "word": "Take Care in Choosing a Life Companion\n     Unwise Marriage Can Ruin Usefulness.--If those who are contemplating marriage would not have miserable, unhappy reflections after marriage, they must make it a subject of serious, earnest reflection now. This step taken unwisely is one of the most effective means of ruining the usefulness of young men and women. Life becomes a burden, a curse. No one can so effectually ruin a woman's happiness and usefulness, and make life a heartsickening burden, as her own husband; and no one can do one hundredth part as much to chill the hopes and aspirations of a man, to paralyze his energies and ruin his influence and prospects, as his own wife. It is from the marriage hour \n\n183\nthat many men and women date their success or failure in this life, and their hopes of the future life.--RH, Feb. 2, 1886.",
