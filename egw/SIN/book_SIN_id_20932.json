    "word": "Christ, equal with God, the brightness of the Father's \"glory, and the express image of his person\" (Hebrews 1:3), clothed His divinity with humanity, and came to this earth to suffer and die for sinners. The only-begotten Son of God humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. By bearing in His body the curse of sin, He placed happiness and immortality within the reach of all. \n                                                                           309",
