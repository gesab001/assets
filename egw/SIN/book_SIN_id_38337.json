    "word": "Represent The Love of Christ. \n\n     Our ministers and teachers should seek to represent the love of Christ to a fallen word. The discourses at our camp-meetings should not be of an oratorical character altogether, for they will be then as the offering of Cain, without the blood of Christ to make them acceptable to Heaven. They should show how God has manifested his hatred of sin and his love for the sinner. Is there any love in the whole world that bears comparison with the love that God has manifested to a lost world? God has commended his love toward us in that he has given all heaven in one gift, even in the gift of his only begotten and well-beloved Son.",
