    "word": "When church members realize the importance of the circulation of our literature, they will devote more time to this work. Papers, tracts, and books will be placed in the homes of the people, to preach the gospel in their several lines. . . . The church must give her attention to the canvassing work. This is one way in which she is to shine in the world. Then will she go forth \"fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.\"--Manuscript 113, 1901.",
