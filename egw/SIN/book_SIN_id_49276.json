Those who have had charge of the school have not felt the importance of putting brain, bone, and muscle to the tax in an effort to make the school a success. The students who attend this school are to be given an education that will fit them to work for the Master. They are to be given more than book knowledge. Should they be given book knowledge merely, their education would be imperfect.",
