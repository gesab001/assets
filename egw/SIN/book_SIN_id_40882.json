    "word": "MR No. 477 - Canvassing an Excellent Training for the Ministry\n\n     Our ministers of experience should instruct the young men who are desirous of entering the ministry, doing all they can to lead them forward in successful evangelistic work. They should take them with them to the places they visit, showing them how to win souls to Christ. But work in the canvassing field will do more than almost anything else to prepare young men for the ministry, after they have had opportunity to become Bible students.-- Letter 132, 1902, p. 7. (To Brother Irwin, August 17, 1902.) \n\nReleased February 2, 1976.",
