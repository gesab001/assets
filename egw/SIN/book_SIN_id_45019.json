    "word": "There are some excellent souls here who love the truth and whose eyes are open to see the deceptions that exist in the popular ministry. \n\n\n                                     -243- \n\nThe ambition with many in the ministry is to please the people who are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. The Congregationalist minister went into the desk about six weeks since and took from his pocket a yellow-covered novel and read several pages in regard to the mermaids of the sea, and after extolling Victor Hugo as a writer far ahead of our American writers, he opened his Bible, read a few words, made a few remarks, and closed.
