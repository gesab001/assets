    "word": "If the moral sensibilities of invalids can be aroused, and they see that they are sinning against their Creator by bringing sickness upon themselves, by the indulgence of appetite, and debasing passions, when they leave the Health Institute, they will not leave their principles behind, but take them with them, and be genuine health reformers at home. If the moral sensibilities are aroused, patients will have a determination to carry out their convictions of conscience. And if they see the truth, they will obey it. They will have true, noble independence to practice the truths to which they assent. If the mind is at peace with God, the bodily conditions will be more favorable.",
