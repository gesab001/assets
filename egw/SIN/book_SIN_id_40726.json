    "word": "Who has elevated man and given him power? Who upholds and sustains him, increasing his efficiency to do good? Is this done in order that man may glorify himself? No true disciple of Christ can be self-centered. Personal ambition will strive for the mastery with our German brethren in America, as it has been and still is striving with our English-speaking brethren. But, my brethren, watch unto prayer, lest ye enter into temptation. Be neither selfish in withholding means, nor selfish in devising and carrying out unsanctified, ambitious projects that will absorb the means that should be used in other places. Realize that as Christ's disciples you are in duty bound to give the truth to the world. . . .",
