    "word": "To secure your present and future good, Christ gave Himself as a sacrifice. Will you draw back from making a covenant with God by sacrifice? Christ died on the cross to save the world from perishing in sin. He asks your cooperation in His work of soul-saving. You are to be His helping hand, to do the work that needs to be done, to place the truth before as many as possible. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" (See 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20.)",
