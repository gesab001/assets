    "word": "Elder Daniel's peculiar talent is to move the feelings of the people; but this, in many, many cases, seen as God sees it, results in far more harm than good. His case has been my special burden for years; and as God has laid open to me the weaknesses and errors of the man, I have laid them distinctly before him. Has he received the testimonies? Has he acted upon them?--No, he has not taken the pains to study them point by point as a word from God to him; he has not heeded the warning. He has imagined something that Sister White has done or said to make of none effect the warnings of the Spirit of God. Will you please to ask Elder Daniels to tell you wherein he thinks Sister White denies her own teachings? Set the words down on paper and send them to me. If I am guilty, I will confess the same; if not, I shall charge him with bearing false witness, as he has done again and again in regard to my words, my actions, and the things which I eat. He says he believes the testimonies but cannot understand them. I present these testimonies now as a solemn duty I owe to the Master, whose servant I am, to see if your eye-sight is so darkened that you cannot understand them. Blindness of the heart is a terrible barrier to the discerning of truth. \"He shall take of mine and shall show it unto you,\" is the declaration of Christ, revealing how the Holy Spirit operates upon the mind. Sin is the disease of the \n\n\n                               [7] \n\nsoul, in consequence of which the understanding fails to do its appointed work on the heart and memory. For many years I have met this more or less in my experience.",
