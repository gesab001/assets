    "word": "What is show and appearance merely?  What are good looks alone without moral worth or true goodness of heart and nobleness of mind?  They are a mere outside gloss, which pleases a certain class of minds, but which will perish in the day of God, leaving only sinful, corrupt deformity. Seek heaven, seek true humility, and God will then direct your path.--Letter 2, 1865.",
