    "word": "There is a criticism that we may exercise, that we shall show mercy and such things as that, and honor and glorify God, but a little speck of an item in the business\u2014it is just as much a sin for that man to take that stand on a little quibble, and hold and hold and hold things in a board, as I have seen it done repeatedly\u2014not with my own natural eyes\u2014but as the Lord has presented it before me to hear it, and to see what is carried on in these business meetings. And I want to tell you, there is more harm done in cultivating that trait of criticism that he will see in time, if he has to wait until the judgment. It would have been better if he had never been born, the way the cause has been.",
