    "word": "All boasting is sinful. Let us put away all self-exaltation, and heed the invitation of Christ. He says, Come unto Me; copy My character; take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. When professed Christians manifest Christ-likeness by revealing his meekness, then they will give evidence that they are born into the kingdom of Christ.",
