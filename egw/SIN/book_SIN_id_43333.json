    "word": "Christ's field was the world. He shall embrace the world of sin. That is the work of the Holy Spirit through the human agencies in bearing to them the life-giving message. Church members, I call upon you. Are you converted? What was the instrumentality that was to be employed? Whose voice is to proclaim the all-important message to our world, that they may be convinced of sin? God calls upon all to act a part, and tax their resources to the uttermost. God has His workmen. He has been using them in the great city of New York.",
