    "word": "The Australian camp meeting of Seventh-day Adventists was held this year in a pleasant grove at Ashfield, a very attractive suburb of Sydney. The weather was fine throughout the camp meeting, and we thoroughly enjoyed our sojourn in the tents. They were arranged in regular village-like order, with streets named after the Reformers. . . . Some of the campers brought their cookstoves and had their tents so arranged that, in passing by, one could see the neatly and bountifully set tables, the white beds, and attractive sitting rooms. . . . Between the forenoon and afternoon meetings the children were taken out to the woods near by and given lessons from nature. . . .",
