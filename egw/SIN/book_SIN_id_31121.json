    "word": "Sin is committed by many who think their crime is effectually concealed. But there is One who says, \"I know thy \n                                                                           89\nworks\"; \"there is nothing covered which shall not be revealed; and hid, which shall not be known.\"  When the mind is infatuated with the idea of sin, there will be deception practiced; lies will be told; for those who commit such sins will not be slow to lie as well. But all sin shall be revealed.",
