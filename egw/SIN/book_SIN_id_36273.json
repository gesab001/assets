    "word": "THE INTERVIEW WAS INTRODUCED BY THE STATEMENT FROM MRS. HARRIS: \"MY HUSBAND IS VERY ANXIOUS TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF PRESENT TRUTH, AND IS DEVOTING SIXTY PER CENT OF THE PROCEEDS OF HIS BUSINESS TO THIS PURPOSE. HE WANTS THE DIRECTION OF THE LORD IN EVERYTHING HE DOES, AND DECIDES HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO HIS DAILY LIFE BY CASTING LOTS. HIS METHOD IS TO TOSS UP A COIN. . . . HE HAS MADE SUCCESSFUL LAND DEALS, AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO TURN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INTO THE WORK. IN THESE DEALS HE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN GUIDED BY THE METHOD ABOVE MENTIONED. HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS ARE ASSUMING LARGER PROPORTIONS, AND GREATER SUMS OF MONEY ARE BEING INVOLVED. IF HE CONTINUES TO DEPEND UPON THIS METHOD OF GUIDANCE, I FEEL THAT HIS AFFAIRS MAY END DISASTROUSLY AT ANY TIME.",
