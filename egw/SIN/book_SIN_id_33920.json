In the darkness the two struggled for the mastery. Not a word was spoken, but Jacob put forth all his strength, and did not relax his efforts for a moment.

He knew that he had been in conflict with a heavenly messenger, and this was why his almost superhuman effort had not gained the victory.\u2014PP 196, 197.",
