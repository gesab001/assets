    "word": "A Reformation Needed After the 1888 General Conference--The Lord was working [at Minneapolis] and I must be faithful to speak the words given me of God, although I was passing through the most grievous trial of my life, for, from this hour, that confidence which I had hitherto had that God was leading and controlling the minds and hearts of my brethren was not as heretofore. I had felt that when a call came to me, \"We want you at our meeting, Sister White; your influence is needed,\" I should not consult my choice \n\n\n                                -229- \n\nor my feelings, but should arise by faith and try to act my part and leave the Lord to do the work that was essential to be done. Now a greater burden falls upon me. From this time I must look alone to God, for I dare not rely upon the wisdom of my brethren. I see they do not always take God for their Counselor, but look in a large degree to the men they have set before them in the place of God. . . .",
