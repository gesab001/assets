    "word": "God has determined to leave nothing undone to recover man from the toils of the enemy. After Christ's ascension, the Holy Spirit was given to man to assist all who would cooperate with Him in the reshaping and remodeling of the human character. The Holy Spirit's part of the work has been defined by our Saviour. He says, \"He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment\" (John 16:8). The Holy Spirit is the convicter, and sanctifier as well.",
