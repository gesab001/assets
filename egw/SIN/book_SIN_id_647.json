    "word": "Chap. Sixty-Six - The Portals We Must Watch\n\n     Why God Gave Us Eyes, Ears, and Speech.--God gave men eyes, that they might behold wondrous things out of His law. He gave them the hearing ear, that they might listen to His message, spoken by the living preacher. He gave men the talent of speech, that they might present Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour. With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.",
