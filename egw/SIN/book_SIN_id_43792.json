There are those who are so constituted that they should not be placed where they will have to deal with other minds as one in charge. They have traits of character that would place their brethren in difficult positions. Thus pain and suffering would be caused when there was no need of it. They would exercise an arbitrary authority, and manifest an overbearing spirit that would imperil the souls of their fellow men. They lack judgement in dealing with their brethren, and a great positiveness takes possession of them. They do not treat their brethren as they would wish to be treated were they in similar circumstances. They forget that Christian courtesy, forbearance, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, pity, and love are to be exercised. \"All ye are brethren.\" There is need of the Spirit of the Master.",
