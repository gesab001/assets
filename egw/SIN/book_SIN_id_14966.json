    "word": "What are you doing, dear youth, to make known to others how important it is to take the word of God for a guide, to keep the commandments of Jehovah? Are you by precept and example declaring that it is only by obedience to the word of God that men can be saved. If you will do what you can, you will be a blessing to others. As you labor according to the best of your ability, ways and opportunities will open before you to do more. --The Youth's Instructor, January 1, 1907.",
