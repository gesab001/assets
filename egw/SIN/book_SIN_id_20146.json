    "word": "The world has set up a standard to suit the inclinations of unsanctified hearts, but this is not the standard of those who love Christ. The Redeemer has chosen them out of the world, and has left them His sinless life as a standard. He wants them to rise above all cheapness of word or action.... \"Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; ...as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.\"",
