    "word": "Chap. XXVIII - Among the Churches in New England\n\n     Refreshed in spirit over the good result of our labor with the Battle Creek church, which closed in October, 1867, we cheerfully joined Elder J. N. Andrews on a journey to Maine. On the way we held a meeting at Roosevelt, N. Y., October 26 and 27. This meeting was one of hard labor, in which pointed testimonies were given. Confessions were made, followed by a general turning to the Lord on the part of backsliders and sinners.",
