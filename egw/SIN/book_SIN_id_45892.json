    "word": "By transgression man was severed from God, the communion between them was broken. But Jesus Christ died upon the cross of Calvary, bearing in His body the sins of the whole world, and the gulf between heaven and earth was bridged by that cross. Christ leads men to the gulf and points to the bridge by which it is spanned, saying, \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me\" [Matthew 16:24].",
