    "word": "This presentation is an illustration of the way in which the truth for this time is to go. A large work is to be done by many who have commenced in a small way. Many souls will be reached, not through display, not through any devising on the part of man, but because of the working of the Holy Spirit on the hearts of the human agencies. The Saviour worked in this way. When His methods become the methods of his followers, his blessing will attend their labors. Let us always remember that our schools are not to be conducted after the worldly plan.",
