    "word": "Do not commit yourselves to the keeping of men, but say, \"The Lord is my helper; I will seek His counsel; I will be a doer of His will.\" All the advantages you may have cannot be a blessing to you, neither can the highest education qualify you to become a channel of light, unless you have the co-operation of the divine Spirit. It is as impossible for us to receive qualifications from men, without the divine enlightenment, as it was for the gods of Egypt to deliver those who trusted in them.",
