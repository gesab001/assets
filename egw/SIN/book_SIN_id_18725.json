    "word": "GOD HEARS JESUS\u2019 INTERCESSION MINGLED WITH OUR PRAYERS.\u2014Christ has pledged Himself to be our substitute and surety, and He neglects no one. There is an inexhaustible fund of perfect obedience accruing from His obedience. In heaven His merits, His self-denial and self-sacrifice, are treasured as incense to be offered up with the prayers of His people. As the sinner\u2019s sincere, humble\n37\nprayers ascend to the throne of God, Christ mingles with them the merits of His own life of perfect obedience. Our prayers are made fragrant by this incense. Christ has pledged Himself to intercede in our behalf, and the Father always hears His Son.\u2014(Sons and Daughters of God, 22.)",
