    "word": "Presidents of Conferences, you will be wise if you will decide to come to God. Believe in him. He will hear your prayers, and come to your assistance, in much less time than the public conveyances could take one, two, three, or four men from a long distance, at a great expense, to decide questions which the God of wisdom can decide far better for you. He has promised, \"If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.\" If you will sincerely humble your hearts before him, empty your souls of self esteem, and put away the natural defects of your character, and overcome your love of supremacy, and come to God as little children, he will bestow on you his Holy Spirit. When two or three shall agree as touching anything, and shall ask the Lord, in the name of Jesus, it shall be done for them.",
