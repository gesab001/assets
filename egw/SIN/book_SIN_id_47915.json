    "word": "Our brethren in America, before carrying out their plans for such an extensive and wonderful work in certain lines, might far better have considered the words of Christ, \"Which of you intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?\" Had they done \n                                                                           123\nthis, acting under the direction of God, men's ideas would not have been carried thus far in building the tower. Thousands of dollars that have been invested in Chicago for the lowest and most unpromising specimens of humanity, would have gone to open new fields, annexing new territory, planting the standard in new places.",
