    "word": "We are to represent Jesus Christ. We are to look at His character, at His life of self-denial, patience, kindness, and forbearance. He ate with publicans and sinners, not that He might partake of their luxuries, or their amusements, or of their feasting, but that He might diffuse the precious gems of truth, and scatter these gems as He was sitting at their table. And those precious jewels of truth which fell from His lips would remain in their hearts. And although they might not yield at once to the influence of the Spirit of God, they would be affected by them and finally yield to them. Why?--because He is drawing them all the time.--Ms. 9, 1891, pp. 9, 10. (\"Make Proper Use of Talents,\" sermon preached at Battle Creek, Michigan, August 22, 1891.)",
