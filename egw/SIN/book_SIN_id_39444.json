    "word": "I went into the Council [Fifth European Council, held June 14-21] this morning at 9:00 a.m. and listened to the testimonies borne in reference to the colporteuring and canvassing work. Elder Matteson related a wonderful experience in his school the past winter in educating colporteurs to give Bible readings. Brethren Conradi, Hendrikson, Olsen, and Lane gave some items of experience in the work. I bore my testimony last, and the Lord blessed me in speaking to encourage faith and confidence in God. The Spirit and power of the Lord rested upon me as I tried to present to the people the goodness of the Lord to me and the grace and power of God bestowed upon me in giving me strength to bear my testimony in the places we had visited since leaving Basel. My heart was broken before the Lord in view of the strength, the presence of the Lord, that had been granted me. In the afternoon I spoke again in regard to the work, its \n\n\n                                     -135- \n\nmagnitude, and the reasons we had to believe the Lord would go before us and put His Spirit and power upon us in large measure, if we would walk humbly before Him, and depend wholly upon Him, and give His holy name the glory for all that was done.",
