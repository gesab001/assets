    "word": "When the churches see young men possessing zeal to qualify themselves to extend their labors to cities, villages, and towns, that have never been aroused to the truth, and missionaries volunteer to go to other nations, to carry the truth to them, the churches will be encouraged and strengthened far more than to have the labors of inexperienced young men. The churches, as they see their ministers' hearts all aglow with love and zeal for the truth and a desire to save souls, will arouse themselves. The churches generally have the gifts and power within themselves to bless and strengthen themselves, and gather into the fold sheep and lambs. They need to be thrown upon their own resources, and so call into active service all the gifts that are lying dormant.",
