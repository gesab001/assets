    "word": "The Sabbath meetings, the morning and evening worship in the home, the services held in the chapel, all should be vitalized by the Spirit of Christ. Each member of the Sanitarium family confess Christ openly and with gladness, expressing the joy and comfort and  hope that is written in the soul. Christ is to be set forth as the chiefest among ten thousand, the one altogether lovely. He is to be set forth as the Giver of every good and perfect gift. the one in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered. If we would do this, all narrowness must be set aside, and we must call into exercise the love of Christ. The joy we experience in this love will be a blessing to others.",
