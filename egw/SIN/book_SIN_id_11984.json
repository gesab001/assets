    "word": "Had these dear brethren possessed greater spirituality, had they realized the binding claim of God's law as every one of us should, they would have known their duty, and would not have been walking in darkness. It was very hard for them to see how they could take any other course. But God does not consult our convenience in regard to his commandments. He expects us to obey them, and to teach them to our children. We have before us the example of Abraham, the father of the faithful. The God of heaven says, \u201cI know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.\u201d And this was why such great blessings were pronounced upon him and his posterity.",
