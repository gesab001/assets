    "word": "The Message of John. John declared that Christ must be received by them individually as a Saviour. They need not expect the priests or the pope to take the place of Christ; for he alone who would come to Christ as a repentant believing sinner would find peace and have Christ's righteousness imputed to him. All sanctification comes through a living, active faith, and transforms men and women into the image of Jesus Christ.",
