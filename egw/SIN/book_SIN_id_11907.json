    "word": "Now is the time when we are to confess and forsake our sins that they may go beforehand to judgment and be blotted out. Now is the time to \u201ccleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u201d It is dangerous to delay this work. Satan is even now seeking by disasters upon sea and land to seal the fate of as many as possible. What is the defense of the people of God at this time? It is a living connection with heaven. If we would dwell in safety from the noisome pestilence, if we would be preserved from dangers seen and unseen, we must hide in God; we must secure the protecting care of Jesus and holy angels. In these days of peril, the Lord would have us walk before him in humility. Instead of trying to cover our sins, he would have us confess them, as Joshua confessed the sins of ancient Israel. We profess to be the depositaries of God's law. We profess to be building up \u201cthe old waste places,\u201d and to be raising up \u201cthe foundations of many generations.\u201d If this great and solemn work has indeed been committed to us, how important that we depart from all iniquity!",
