    "word": "Some talk of going to far-off countries as missionaries; and this is well, if the Lord so directs. A brother under conviction of sin once said, \"I want to be converted, that I may go out to the heathen to help them.\" \"Why,\" said I, \"begin at home; become right with God where you are; put away your sins, and be a home missionary.\" If we cannot be missionaries at home, we can never expect to do good in another field. All about us there are heathen. Only a few miles from where you live, there are poor people who have never heard of the Seventh-day Adventists and the third angel's message; they know but little regarding the sacredness of God's law.",
