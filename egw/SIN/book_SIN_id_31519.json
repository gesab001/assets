The only cure for a useless, inefficient life is effort, determined, persevering effort. The only cure for selfishness is to deny self, and work earnestly to be the blessing that you can be to your fellowmen. \"He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.\"",
