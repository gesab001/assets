    "word": "The truth of God has been resisted and trampled down by men who hated its pure and heavenly principles. Men have walked in the fire of the sparks of their own kindling. God wants every man who is connected with his sacred work to be a man with whom he can communicate, a man of humble, teachable spirit, and contrite heart. Workers who possess this character will not creep and grovel in earthliness, they will not be in bondage to men nor to Satanic agencies. They will quit themselves like men, and be strong. They will turn their faces to the Sun of Righteousness, rising above all baser things into an atmosphere pure from all spiritual and moral defilement.",
