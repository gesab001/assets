    "word": "My husband is cheerful and happy. All depression is gone. He has been hard at work ever since he came home. We cry earnestly to God in faith for help and we believe we shall have it. We were much needed here. No one can do the work here but my husband. He knows just how to take hold in the office to set things in order. All respect his judgment. He has utterly refused to take any office but yet I fear he will have to fill his position as president of Association this year again. No one will consent to take the office. It will have to remain vacant if he does not serve.",
