    "word": "How can this be done? By constantly regarding your property as the Lord's and not your own, and yourselves as stewards of God, earnest, anxious, watching, to see what you can do in any direction to help advance the cause of God. This God's work, and you are his servants entrusted with his goods. Now if you use the Lord's goods to benefit your own personal interest far more than to benefit and advance the cause of God, you are using that which is the Lord's to flow in a selfish, worldly channel, and the cause of God is left without the means that God has entrusted to you as his stewards to be used for this very purpose. Now the reason that there is not more means in the treasury is because those whom God has made his stewards of means are unfaithful to their trust. They use God's money for selfish purposes as if it were their own, and send the means which the cause of God needs to advance his work in the world to flowing in an earthly current, in the place of being put out to the exchangers and invested in the cause of God to bring to him double improvements.",
