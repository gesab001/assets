    "word": "You may say, How can I sing, with this dark prospect before me, with this burden of sorrow and bereavement upon my soul? But have earthly sorrows deprived us of the all-powerful Friend we have in Jesus? Should not the marvelous love of God in the gift of His dear Son be a theme of continual rejoicing? When we bring our petitions to the throne of grace, let us not forget to offer also anthems of thanksgiving. \"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth Me\" (Psalm 50:23). As long as our Saviour lives we have cause for unceasing gratitude and praise.--RH, Nov 1, 1881. (2SM 268, 269.)",
