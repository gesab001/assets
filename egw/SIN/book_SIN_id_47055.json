G. White. \n                           (Continued.) \n                                                                -\n \n     Brethren and sisters, with the increased light that has shone upon you at this meeting, will you go home to be more faithful in your Christian life? Meetings have been held every day to instruct your children as to how to give their hearts to Jesus, how to live in a manner that will be acceptable to God. They have been instructed that if they repent of their sins, Jesus will forgive them, and cleanse them from all unrighteousness. Who will carry forward the good work that has been begun? Day by day these children need instruction as to how to follow the Lord. Will you pray for them and teach them, and lead them in the way of righteousness? Will you teach your little ones of the love of God which led him to give his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting life?",
