    "word": "There needs to be a reaching out after God, not . . . now and then, but a continual earnest, heartbreaking confessing and humbling of the soul before God. God's people must come into the audience chamber of the Most High. . . . God understands that you need Him, and if you ask, you will receive help when tempted and tried. Your petitions, made known only to God who searcheth the heart, He will hear and answer.--Letter 45, Nov. 15, 1897, to A. G. Daniells and \"my ministering brethren, and the church in Melbourne.\"",
