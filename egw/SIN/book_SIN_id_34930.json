    "word": "Work in a Way That Will Remove Prejudice.-- My brethren and sisters, visit those who live near you, and by sympathy and kindness seek to reach their hearts. Be sure to work in a way that will remove prejudice instead of creating it. And remember that those who know the truth for this time and yet confine their efforts to their own churches, refusing to work for their unconverted neighbors, will be called to account for unfulfilled duties.--Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 34, 35. \n                                                                           89",
