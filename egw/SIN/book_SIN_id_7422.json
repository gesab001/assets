    "word": "A Blessed Meeting.--This day has been a most precious season of refreshment to my soul. The little company here are organized into a church, and I met with them to celebrate the ordinances. I spoke from John 13, and precious ideas were impressed upon my mind in regard to the ordinance of humility. . . . There is much in this simple rite that is not seen and appreciated. I was blessed in partaking of the symbols of the broken body and spilled blood of our precious Saviour, who became sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. He was our sin bearer.",
