    "word": "Before the universe has been clearly presented the great sacrifice made by the Father and the Son in man's behalf. The hour has come when Christ occupies his rightful position, and is glorified above principalities and powers and every name that is named. It was for the joy that was set before him,\u2014that he might bring many sons unto glory,\u2014 that he endured the cross and despised the shame. And inconceivably great as was the sorrow and the shame, yet greater is the joy and the glory. He looks upon the redeemed, renewed in his own image, every heart bearing the perfect impress of the divine, every face reflecting the likeness of their King. He beholds in them the result of the travail of his soul, and he is satisfied. Then, in a voice that reaches the assembled multitudes of the righteous and the wicked, he declares, \u201cBehold the purchase of my blood! For these I suffered; for these I died; that they might dwell in my presence throughout eternal ages.\u201d And the song of praise ascends from the white-robed ones about the throne, \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.\u201d [Revelation 5:12.]",
