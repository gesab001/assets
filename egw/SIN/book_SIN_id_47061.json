    "word": "If the minister had a realizing sense of the presence of God, would he conduct himself in this way? He had great light, and had taken upon himself the sacred responsibility of a minister of God, and yet he acts as carelessly as if he was an unbeliever. His actions make it evident that he has as much realization of the presence of God as had Belshazzar when he drank from the sacred vessels from the house of the Lord, praising the gods of gold and silver. The mighty men and the lords of the kingdom were assembled, and they ate and drank, and had a jovial time, but the True Witness was there, and their profanity was recorded in the books of heaven. In the midst of their revelry, a bloodless hand appeared, tracing mysterious characters upon the wall of the palace, and their godless mirth was checked, and terror and despair took its place. They inquired for some one who could interpret the writing, and Daniel, the prophet of God, was called to the banquet room, and the servant of the Lord was able to decipher the writing, and interpret the meaning of the words. \"This is the interpretation of the thing; Mene; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it Tekel; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. Peres; Thy kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.\"",
