    "word": "Before his presence, \u201call faces are turned into paleness;\u201d upon the rejecters of God's mercy falls the terror of eternal despair. \u201cThe heart melteth, and the knees smite together,\u201d \u201cand the faces of them all gather blackness.\u201d [Jeremiah 30:6; Nahum 2:10.] The righteous cry with trembling, \u201cWho shall be able to stand?\u201d The angels\u2019 song is hushed, and there is a period of awful silence. Then the voice of Jesus is heard, saying, \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you.\u201d The faces of the righteous are lighted up, and joy fills every heart. And the angels strike a note higher, and sing again, as they draw still nearer to the earth.",
