    "word": "My son, you will find that you can not please all men. You will offend some even when you do your best. But be very careful and guarded not to give occasion for your good to be evil spoken of. You can not know how anxious I am to have you stand on vantage ground; for there are those who for years have covered their own neglect to take up work in the South, by finding fault with the active labors in that field. Instead of showing their tact and ability by doing their best to start the work in new places, they have stood to one side, criticizing what Edson White and his co-workers have been doing. Those who have not \"put off the old man with his deeds.\" are standing as accusers of the brethren. Before angels and men Satan is zealously accusing the laborers who take up the work of God in new places. The men who do not take upon themselves the burden of God's work will be kept very busy by the enemy in accusing and picking flaws with those who are determined to advance the work in missionary fields.",
