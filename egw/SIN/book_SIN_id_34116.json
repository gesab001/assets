    "word": "Poverty is not a sin unless by recklessness men bring poverty upon themselves. And even then, if they repent, they will be pardoned. . . . Those who have faith in Christ as a personal Saviour, even though they may occupy a humble place in the world, are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ to an immortal inheritance. They have an insurance policy to eternal life.",
