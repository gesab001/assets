    "word": "We are the Lord\u2019s property. Christ has paid a sum for our ransom that in no way can be computed. He gave Himself a living offering to God. He bore the sins of the transgressor, that God might be just and yet be the justifier of the repenting, believing sinner. In the wilderness of temptation He overcame every temptation on the point of appetite. He fasted forty days and forty nights, and in His weak condition Satan assailed Him. But He answered not with His own words, for Satan was ready to enter into controversy had He done this. . . . The insinuating temptation was presented, \u201cIf thou be the Son of God, command that this stone be made bread.\u201d But the \u201cif \u201d was not accepted, and there was no ground for controversy. . . .",
