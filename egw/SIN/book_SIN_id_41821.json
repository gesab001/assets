    "word": "The Camp Meeting Is a Success--Dear Bro. and Sister Smith: I send you in this envelope a letter written at odd times, as events occurred and purposing to copy it, but I send it as it is. With it I send a copy of a letter for a family with whom we labored most earnestly. Since coming to this meeting we are told that the husband has kept the two last Sabbaths. We thank the Lord for this. One of his sons was baptized the last Sabbath that we were in Gisborne. Still another son has taken his position since the father closed his shop on the Sabbath and one more son, fifteen years old, has decided to be a Christian. The father and mother and two daughters \n\n\n                                     -14- \n\nand three sons are in harmony in the truth. There is still another son, twenty-two years of age, at home who has not taken his stand. I shall address a letter to him sometime during this meeting.",
