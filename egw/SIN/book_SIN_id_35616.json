    "word": "The tares and wheat are now commingled, but then the one Hand that alone can separate them will give to every one his true position. Those who have had the light of truth, and heard the warning message, heard the invitation to the marriage supper, --farmer, merchant, lawyer, false shepherds who have quieted the \n\n\n                         - 7 - \n\nconvictions of the people, unfaithful watchmen who have not sounded the warning or known the time of night,--all who have refused obedience to the laws of the kingdom of God, will have no right therein. Those who have sought an excuse to avoid the cross of separation from the world, will, with the world, be taken in the snare. They mingled with the tares from choice. Like drew to like in transgression. It is a fearful assimilation. Men choose to stand with the first rebel, who tempted Adam and Eve in Eden to disobey God. The tares multiply themselves, for they sow tares, and they have their part with the root of all sin -- the devil.",
