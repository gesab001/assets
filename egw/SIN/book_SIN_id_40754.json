    "word": "MR No. 425 - Inspiration for Nurses\n\n     Some of our brethren in California gave a donation of forty-five dollars as a token of sympathy, expressing a desire that I would buy me a good comfortable chair. I have appropriated that gift to this church [Parramatta, NSW]. I told those who presented the gift that I wished them to have something invested in this missionary field. True, I needed as comfortable a chair as I could possibly get, but I will wait hoping that the Lord will restore me to health. I hope not to need easy chairs long, though I am still under the hand of affliction. I rejoice to see the truth gathering souls who will show forth the praises of Him that hath called them out of darkness into His marvelous light.--Letter 34, 1892, pp. 6, 7. (To Dr. and Mrs. John Harvey Kellogg, September 16, 1892.)",
