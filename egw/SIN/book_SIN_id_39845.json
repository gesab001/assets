    "word": "Orebro, Sweden, June 24, 1886. We left Basel June 15 and came to Hamburg in company with Sarah and Christine Dahl. W. C. W. preceded us. He \n\n\n                                     -394- \n\nstarted the morning of the fourteenth in company with Elders Whitney and Conradi. These visited Leipsic on business, and were quite successful. We met W. C. on the evening of the sixteenth. We took the boat at Kiel at midnight. We were accommodated with a stateroom, and had an opportunity to sleep from two o'clock until five o'clock. After the boat arrived we had to go through the preliminaries of the customhouse. That over, we made our way to the waiting room, placed our numerous satchels and bundles together, and took some refreshments--hot milk and bread. We then took up our baggage and stepped into the cars.",
