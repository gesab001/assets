    "word": "When the servants of God are tried and tempted, and are disappointed in obtaining human sympathy, let them remember Jesus in His hour of greatest agony in Gethsemane. His disciples did not watch with Him one hour. Sleep over-powered their senses. The King of glory, the Son of the everlasting Father, left His royal throne, clothed His divinity with humanity, and became \"a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\" No man's trials or sacrifice could compare with those which His suffering spirit endured. The Majesty of heaven walked through midnight blackness, and for what? \"Who for the joy that was set before Him, endured the cross, despising the shame.\" It was to redeem fallen man. He endured the overwhelming weight of woe in order that He might bring many sons and daughters unto glory. He suffered rejection, coldness, contempt, from those He came to bless: persecution, betrayal, crucifixion, from those He humiliated Himself to save. The whole flood-tide of human woe beat upon His soul.",
