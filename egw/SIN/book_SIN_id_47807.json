    "word": "Great opportunities are given to the guardians of the sick. Knowing the Lord Jesus, it is the privilege of the Christian physician to introduce Him to the sick-room as the One who can speak peace to the soul and give strength to the body. He can point the sufferer to the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world. The Lord will give such a physician great wisdom in his work.",
