    "word": "Our meeting at Wolcott was of special interest. A canvas was attached to the house to accommodate the people. The Lord blessed us with freedom, and the truth affected hearts. I had a vision in the congregation, and had perfect liberty in relating it. I there became acquainted with our dear Sr. Pierce. My heart was drawn out in sympathy and love for her, for I had been in a similar state of mind. At this meeting our dear Bro. Benson was convicted of the truth. He believed the vision he witnessed to be the power of God, and was affected by it. He fully embraced the truth. Others decided at that meeting to obey all God's commandments and live. Since that meeting we have met Bro. B.'s cheerful countenance in every conference we have attended in Vermont. But we shall meet him in this mortal state no more. He died in hope, and will rest in the silent grave until the resurrection of the just.",
