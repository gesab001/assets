    "word": "Our school was a success. It was small, for these are hard times with everybody, but the blessing of the Lord attended the school. The Bible Lessons were greatly appreciated, and the students were so well pleased with the school, and especially with the religious instruction, that they readily complied with the rules, and not one case of discipline was necessary during the term. The Spirit of the Lord was often manifested in a marked manner. Next term the numbers will be doubled. The Lord will work in these colonies, we shall see of His salvation.",
