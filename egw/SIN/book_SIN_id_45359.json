    "word": "ELLEN WHITE'S OWN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CLEAN-UNCLEAN DISTINCTION SEEMS TO HAVE GROWN STRONGER OVER TIME. IN 1864 SHE DID NOTE IN PASSING THAT NOAH WAS ALLOWED TO EAT \"CLEAN\" BEASTS AFTER THE FLOOD. AND IN 1890, WHEN PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS WAS PUBLISHED, SHE NOTED THAT SAMSON'S PARENTS HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM \"EVERY UNCLEAN THING.\" THIS DISTINCTION \"BETWEEN ARTICLES OF FOOD AS CLEAN AND UNCLEAN\" WAS NOT, SHE SAID, \"A MERELY CEREMONIAL AND ARBITRARY REGULATION, BUT WAS BASED UPON SANITARY PRINCIPLES.\" FURTHERMORE, THE \"MARVELOUS VITALITY\" OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS COULD BE TRACED TO THIS DISTINCTION. SIGNIFICANTLY, SHE HAD NOT NOTED THIS ASPECT OF SAMSON'S LIFE IN 1881 WHEN SHE WROTE THE ARTICLES ON WHICH MOST OF THE MATERIAL ON SAMSON IN PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS IS BASED. IN 1905 SHE AGAIN EXPOUNDED FAVORABLY ON THE DISTINCTION AS GIVEN TO THE JEWS, THIS TIME MENTIONING, IN ADDITION TO PORK, \"OTHER ANIMALS AND BIRDS WHOSE FLESH WAS PRONOUNCED UNCLEAN.\" THE PASSAGE GOES ON TO ENUMERATE OTHER ASPECTS OF JEWISH HEALTH LAWS WHICH SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS HAVE NEVER SOUGHT TO ENFORCE, SO THAT IN SUMMARY IT CAN BE SAID THAT MRS. WHITE NEVER EXPLICITLY DECLARED THAT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN CLEAN AND UNCLEAN MEATS WAS ONE WHICH SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS WERE STILL BOUND TO OBSERVE. HER STATEMENTS COMMENDING THE JEWISH PRACTICE CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THAT POSITION, BUT NEVER MAKE IT EXPLICIT.",
