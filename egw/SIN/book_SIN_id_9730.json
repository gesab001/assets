    "word": "Some are in great peril through self-esteem. If they have a measure of success, Satan suggests to them that they are men of talent; and there are men and women professing godliness who help him in his work by repeating his suggestion. The man who is praised for his ability learns to rely on his own understanding, and does not feel his need of help from above. Selfishness becomes a ruling principle with him, his soul is spotted and marred by self-exaltation, and the weakness of his character is made manifest. The Lord leaves such persons to go on in their self-sufficiency, to work without his grace and special help; and they congratulate themselves that they have his blessing, when they are walking in the sparks of \n440\ntheir own kindling. All this labor is a positive injury; for it blocks the way against the efficient labor of devoted men. These persons need humble, pure religion, which is not tainted with self-exaltation. Jesus says to them, as he said to Peter, \u201cWhen thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d [Luke 22:32.]",
