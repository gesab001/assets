    "word": "I say, give Elder Loughborough men to work with him and let his efforts be put forth in Michigan from church to church. Let his experience, with the help that God shall give him, settle the wavering faith of the people who are losing their bearings because of the watchmen giving the trumpet an uncertain sound. Let everything be done that can be done for the churches in Michigan to strengthen the things that remain that are ready to die. Why not encourage Elder Loughborough and Brother Lunt to come to Michigan and work in this state? Both can do a similar work; they can bear a testimony of the things they have seen and heard, felt and handled. They will do more good in this kind of labor than the whole season of camp meetings, for what the people need is personal effort, and words and influence to settle the faith of those who are now in uncertainty.",
