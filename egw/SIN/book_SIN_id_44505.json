    "word": "You should not allow yourself to make your labors unnecessarily severe. When your labors have been protracted to an unreasonable length, then comes a feeling of weariness and a lack of vitality, and every part of the being cries out with pain and distress. Your vocal organs cannot bear the strain you have put upon them by long, loud talking and praying. A high tone of voice is an expenditure of vital force which is entirely unnecessary, and is a violation of the laws of health. You can, with carefulness, calm consideration, and self-control, work temperately, and yet do good work for the Master. You should consider it a sin to waste your strength, for you can use it all to a wise purpose.",
