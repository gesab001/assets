    "word": "\"What rich blessings are there! With the psalmist I could say: 'How precious also are Thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with Thee.' Psalm 139:17, 18. These last words express my feelings and experience. When I awake, the first thought and expression of my heart is: 'Praise the Lord! I love Thee, O Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee! \n                                                                           340\nPrecious Saviour, Thou hast bought me with the price of Thine own blood. Thou hast considered me of value, or Thou wouldst not have paid an infinite price for my salvation. Thou, my Redeemer, hast given Thy life for me, and Thou shalt not have died for me in vain.' . . .",
