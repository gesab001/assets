    "word": "There must be no compromise in which principle is sacrificed for policy. Every sincere hearer and believer of the truth is required of God to make manifest the principles of truth before the world and before the angels. The believers must manifest an intense solicitude in order that the principles of his faith may be set forth clean and pure before all men. Christians are to reveal the fact that the truth has wrought for the purification of their characters, and the elevation of their minds. He who has heard the truth, who has realized that the light of heaven has shone upon his soul, and who has not walked in the light, has hid his talent in the earth. There must needs be stirring testimonies given, that will lead men to take hold of the truth, in order that the transforming power of the truth may be seen upon their lives and character.",
