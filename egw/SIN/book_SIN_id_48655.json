    "word": "If the physicians are so busy that they cannot treat the sick outside of the institution, would it not be wiser for all to educate themselves in the use of simple remedies, than to venture to use drugs, that are given a long name to hide their real qualities? Why need any one be ignorant of God's remedies,--hot water fomentations and cold and hot compresses? It is important to become familiar with the benefit of dieting in case of sickness. All should understand what to do themselves. They may call upon some one who understands nursing, but every one should have an intelligent knowledge of the house he lives in. All should understand what to do in case of sickness.",
