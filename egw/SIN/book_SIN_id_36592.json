    "word": "The Redeemer of the world warns us against the pride of life, but not against its grace and natural beauty. He pointed to the glowing beauty of the flowers of the field, and to the lily reposing in its spotless purity upon the bosom of the lake, and said, \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\" Here he shows that notwithstanding men and women may have so great care, and toil with weariness to make themselves objects of admiration by outward decorations, all their artificial adornments, which they value, will not bear comparison with the simple flowers of the field for natural loveliness. Even these simple flowers, with God's adornment, would outvie in loveliness the gorgeous apparel of Solomon. Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.",
