    "word": "This parable was given by Christ to represent the manner our Heavenly Father receives the erring and repenting. The Father was the one sinned against, yet he, in the compassion of his soul, all full of pity and forgiveness, meets the prodigal and shows his great joy that his son whom he believed to be dead to all filial affection, had become sensible of his great sin and his neglect, and had come back to his father, appreciating his love, and acknowledging his claims. He knew that the son who had pursued a course of sin and now repented, needed his pity and his love. He had suffered. He felt his need. He came to his father as the only one who could supply his great need.",
