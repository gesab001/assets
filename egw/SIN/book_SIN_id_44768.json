    "word": "God has made a covenant of grace with you. Christ is your hope, your refuge. It will be well for you to consider carefully your accountability to Him, your need of walking in the ways of the Lord, so that you may be enabled to carry the responsibilities placed on you in consecrated, prayerful dependence on Him, with an eye single to His glory. God will help you to labor in a way that will bring encouragement and upbuilding to those who are striving to follow the Lord in self-denial and who cherish pure, unadulterated principles.",
