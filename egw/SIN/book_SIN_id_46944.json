[8], 1891 \n\nDear Brother and Sister [J.S.] Washburn: \n     I received Brother Washburn's letter day before yesterday, and since then we have been having very much work. We had a favorable journey from Washington to this place. I suffered considerably with heat and somewhat with heart disturbance, but much less that I anticipated. We left the sleeper before we arrived at Toledo, at which place we waited about forty minutes. In that time we obtained a cup of hot drink and some crackers which made us feel very much better. We arrived at Battle Creek about three o'clock, [Tuesday Dec. 30] and found the folks all well and glad to see us.",
