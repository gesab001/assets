    "word": "How much has been lost because those who should have stood true as a rock to principle have been conformed to the world in their eating and drinking and dressing, rather than transformed. But you have hurt your own soul and the physical has suffered because of the backsliding of God's people when they might have been advancing firmly in practicing temperance in all things, and they would have had a free, clear, bold testimony to bear in regard to the requirements of God on this subject. But my much respected brother, keep in mind that the Lord has not made you a sin bearer; there is but one who can carry the sins of the world and you cannot bear even your own sins. These are laid upon the Son of the living God. Then your mind must not be irritated and chafed over the manifold defection of those around you, and especially those who you think should know better. This hurts the most.",
