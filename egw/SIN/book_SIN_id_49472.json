    "word": "God would have his Word and his wisdom demonstrated. Truth has \n\n                                    -153- \n\nbeen so covered with the rubbish of error that it can not shine forth in its native purity and brightness to illuminate the surrounding darkness. God would have his directions followed to the letter, that truth may be rescued from the companionship of error. He calls for all the talents with which he has endowed men. He calls upon his servants to receive from the Holy Spirit his sanctifying power, that the light may shine forth in clear, distinct rays, amid the constantly increasing moral darkness, which is becoming as black as sackcloth of hair over our world. . . .",
