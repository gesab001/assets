    "word": "Our churches in _____ do not possess discernment. They are not walking in the light of truth. Many know the truth, but do it not. Their practice is not in accordance with the truth. Self-indulgence in eating, drinking, and dressing is idolatry. How few live a life of humility and meekness, seeking the Lord in earnestness. How few realize that as fathers and mothers they are educating their children to show as little respect for sacred things as they themselves have shown. The atmosphere surrounding the souls of fathers and mothers fills the whole house and is felt in every department of the home.",
