    "word": "I returned here in time to be present at the closing exercises of the school. The Lord gave me words to speak to the students. The first term has made an excellent impression on the minds of the students. The closing meeting was good. Some of the students spoke, expressing themselves fully in regard to the benefits they had received in Bible study, how much better they understood the plan of salvation, justification by faith, the righteousness of Christ as imputed to us. This term has been a success; next term we shall have double, I hope treble, the number of students.",
