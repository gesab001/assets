    "word": "Will we open the door and let Jesus come in with the riches of His grace? \"The Spirit of truth . . . shall be in you.\" John 14:17. We are become indeed the building, even the temple of the living God. We are watched over by faithful sentinels day and night. We are kept by the power of God through faith. Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God by resisting or refusing the gift of His grace and choosing your own way. \"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" John 17:3.",
