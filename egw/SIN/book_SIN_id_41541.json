    "word": "A thorough acquaintance with the Scriptures is our only safeguard against the seductive errors that Satan will bring in, to deceive if possible the very elect. The Holy Spirit's teaching is God's means of enlightening the minds and purifying the hearts of His people, guiding them in duty, shielding them from \n\n\n                                     -5- \n\ndanger, keeping them in the fear and love of God, and in patient waiting for His appearing. No one is to say in his heart, My Lord delayeth His coming. We are not to speak a word that will lead anyone to think that our faith is decreasing. We are to do nothing to weaken the confidence that ought to be strengthened, nothing to bewilder minds that ought to be enlightened by the truth in regard to their positions as transgressors of God's law. We are to stand before God with fear and trembling for what is coming upon our world. I am afraid of men who rely upon their own wisdom, paying court to those who are opposed to the laws that govern God's kingdom, lessening the influence of the truth.",
