    "word": "16-18, 23. Titus Journeys to Corinth.--Paul's testimony was accepted as of great weight, because of the many revelations he had received. He knew better than did many others of the necessities of various places. But Paul was unwilling to take personal charge of the raising of this contribution. He had been largely instrumental in causing it to be raised, but, lest any should find occasion to speak evil, Titus and his companions . . . . made the journey to Corinth; for there was no safe way of transporting money at that time (MS 101, 1906).",
