    "word": "MR No. 1484 - The Bible as the Only Foundation of Our Faith\n\n     (Written June 13, 1901, from Oakland, California, to Dr. and Mrs. J. H. Kellogg.) \n\n\n     I have had a prosperous journey. I have attended many meetings in different places. At Indianapolis I was surprised to meet so large a number. On the Sabbath I met with most intelligent looking people in the church. The audience presented a singular appearance, for all the sisters had removed their hats. This was well. I was impressed with the favorable appearance. The people were not obliged to stretch their necks to see over a mass of flowers and ribbons. I believe that this is an example worth following by other congregations.",
