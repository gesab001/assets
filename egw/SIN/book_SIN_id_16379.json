    "word": "Watch carefully, prayerfully, conscientiously, lest the mind become so engrossed with many important business transactions that true godliness is overlooked and love is quenched from the soul, notwithstanding the great and pitiful need of your being God's helping hand to the blind and to all others who are unfortunate. The most friendless demand the most attention. Use your time and strength in learning to be \"fervent in spirit,\" to deal justly, and to love mercy, \"serving the Lord.\" Remember that Christ says, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\"",
