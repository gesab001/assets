    "word": "The English engine is a plain, homely-looking affair, without polish or ornament. There is no bell, no immense cow-catcher, no great head-light. These things are not necessary, because the track is thoroughly protected either by high walls or by strong fences or hedges, and all the road-crossings, foot-paths, and intersecting lines are generally built above or below the grade. Where they are not thus built, trustworthy persons are employed to guard the crossing, and at a certain signal to close the entrance to the track, either by gates, bars, or chains. Accidents rarely occur; but when one does, the laws are very severe on the railroad company.",
