    "word": "The Lord Jesus Christ has borne patiently with the inconsistencies and the perversities of human hearts, and why should we not bear with those who are in error? Why should so many defend the truth with an intolerant spirit and exhibit self to such an extent that they injure the cause far more than they advance it? They give occasion for unbelievers to discredit the sincerity of \n\n\n                                    -209- \n\nthose who love the truth. Let him who stands in defense of truth ever bring his spirit, his mind, his words, and his deportment into subjection to Christ, and then he will adorn the doctrine.",
