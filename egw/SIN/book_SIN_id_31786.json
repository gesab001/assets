    "word": "51\n     Great is the work of the Lord. Men are choosing sides. Even those supposed to be heathen will choose the side of Christ, while those who become offended, as did the disciples, will go away and walk no more with Him. And others will come in and occupy the place they have left vacant. The time is very near when man shall have reached the prescribed limits. He has now almost exceeded the bounds of the long-suffering of God, the limits of His grace, the limits of His mercy. The record of their works in the books of heaven is, \u201cWeighed in the balances, and found wanting.\u201d The Lord will interfere to vindicate His own honour, to repress the swellings of unrighteousness and bold transgression.",
