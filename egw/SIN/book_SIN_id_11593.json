    "word": "The servants of God are to watch for souls as they that must give an account. If in the restaurant work more is not done to advance the work of soul-saving than has been done in the past, the workers in the restaurants would better use their talents in lines of work that will do more to draw souls to Christ. The interests of Christ's kingdom are paramount to all else. We are not to bend our energies to the establishment of food stores and food factories merely to supply people with temporal food and make money. Thousands are perishing in sin, and the energies of God's people are to be put forth to arouse souls to a sense of their danger.",
