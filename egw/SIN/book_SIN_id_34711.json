    "word": "Chap. 52 - Every Person an Original\n\n     No Man's Shadow--Ministers are never to copy any man's gestures, his habits, his attitude, his expressions, the tones of his voice. They are to become no man's shadow, in thought, in sentiment, or in devising and executing the great whole. If God has made you a shepherd of the flock, He has given you qualification to do that work. Christ says, \"Call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven\" [Matthew 23:9]. Let every man take his Bible, and place himself in divine communion with the great Teacher. God is the source from which all knowledge and wisdom flows.--Ms 104, 1898.",
