    "word": "Isaac was the figure of the Son of God who was offered a sacrifice for the sins of the world. God would impress upon Abraham the gospel of salvation to man. In order to do this, and make the truth to him a reality, as well as to test his faith, he required of him to slay his darling Isaac. All the sorrows and agony Abraham endured through this dark and fearful trial were for the purpose of deeply impressing upon his understanding the plan of redemption for fallen man. He was made to understand in his own experience how unutterable was the self-denial of the infinite God in giving his own Son to die to rescue man from utter ruin. No mental torture to Abraham could be equal to that he endured \n                                                                           14\nin obeying the divine command to sacrifice his son.",
