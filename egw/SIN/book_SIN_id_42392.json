    "word": "There is only one hope for you. You must come to Christ as a poor sinner ready to perish, humble your soul before God, exercise that repentance that needeth not to be repented of; and God will receive you. You are constantly under remorse when you are communicating from the Word light and truth to others. If that truth sanctified your own life, you would be a blessing and not a curse. Your only hope is to seek the Lord while He may be found, to call upon Him while He is near. \"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon\" [Isaiah 55:7].",
