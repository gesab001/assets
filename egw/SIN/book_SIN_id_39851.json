    "word": "Orebro, Sweden, June 28, 1886. I will write you a little day by day as things transpire. We have received a letter from Edson. I was glad to hear from you. I sent you a letter from Basel about two or three weeks since and another from this place last Friday so I will not try to answer directly your last letter which was most gratefully received.",
