    "word": "Location of Our Schools. \n\n     No pains should be spared to select places for our schools where the moral atmosphere will be [as] healthful as possible; for the influences that prevail will leave a deep impress on young and forming characters. For this reason a retired locality is best. The great cities, the centers of business and learning, may seem to present some advantages; but these advantages are outweighed by other considerations.--Sp. Test. on Ed., p. 43.",
