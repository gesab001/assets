    "word": "I write to you as I would to a son. Break away from the enemy--the accuser of the brethren. Say to him, \"Get thee behind me, Satan. I have committed a grievous sin in heeding your suggestions. I will no longer listen to them.\" I beg of you, for your soul's sake, to resist the tempter, that he may flee from you. Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. You will lose heaven unless you fall on the Rock and are broken.--Letter 253, 1903, pp. 1, 12-14. (To J. H. Kellogg, Nov. 20, 1903.)",
