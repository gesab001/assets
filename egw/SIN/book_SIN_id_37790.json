    "word": "The Scriptures are given for our benefit that we may have instruction in righteousness. Precious rays of light have been obscured by the clouds of error, but Christ is ready to sweep away the mist of error and superstition, and reveal to us the brightness of the Father's glory, so that we shall say as did the disciples, \"Did not our heart burn within us, while He talked with us by the way?\" The psalmist prayed, \"Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law,\" and the Lord regarded his sincere prayer, for the sacred record records his satisfaction in the truth revealed to him. He says: \"How sweet are Thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!\" \"More to be desired are \n                                                                           57\nthey than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.\" How rare is this experience!",
