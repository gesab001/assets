    "word": "God is good, and greatly to be praised. His mercies have been freely bestowed upon us. He has surrounded us with tokens of His love. The heathen may rage and imagine vain things, but the Lord is unchangeable. He has made the strength of the everlasting hills to be a safe retreat for His people. He has prepared the mountains and the caves for His oppressed and persecuted children. We may sing, \"God is our refuge and strength in time of trial.\" He who made the towering mountains, the everlasting hills--to Him we may look.--Manuscript 100, Aug. 20, 1898, \"Through Nature to Nature's God.\"",
