    "word": "The Lord has graciously invited all to come. When He was on earth He said to the unbelieving, obstinate Pharisees, \"Ye will not come unto Me, that ye might have life.\" Oh, that this may never be said of us. There is life and peace and joy in Jesus Christ. He is the sinner's friend. There is power and glory and strength for us all in Him, and if we believe that this power and glory is ours, if we comply with the conditions laid down in His Word, we shall be strong in the strength of the mighty One.",
