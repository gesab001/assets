    "word": "MR No. 719 - Ellen White's Care for Her Parents\n\n     My children are as well as usual. Father and Mother are living with us, and they seem so contented and happy. They take care of their room, but eat with us. You don't know what a weight of care is removed from me, since I can watch over these two aged children. Mother does just as I wish her to, follows every suggestion I make. I dress her up neat as wax, comb her hair, and she looks like a nice venerable old lady. Father also tries to please us in every way. We fix him up and he looks real nice.",
