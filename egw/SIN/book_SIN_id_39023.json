    "word": "The Future Use of \"Object Lessons\" \n\n                      St. Helena, Cal., May 18, 1903. \n     The use which should be made of \"Object Lessons\" in the future has been made clear to me, and I must write to my brethren in regard to it. Letters have been received from our canvassing agents, in which they say that they think it would be a good plan for \"Object Lessons\" to be handled as a regular subscription book, as soon as the relief-of-the-schools campaign is finished. They believe that this book would have as ready a sale in the hands of the regular canvasser as any that could be produced.",
