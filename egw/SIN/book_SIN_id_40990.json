    "word": "No one has greater need of a living connection with the Lord Jesus than the physician. He should cherish a constant sense of the importance of spiritual things. He cannot afford to be mixed up in common business transactions. He should not load himself down with responsibilities that others can carry. He is to keep his mind pure and clear, free from common worldly business. God will illuminate the minds of those who are willing to be educated by Him, those who will hold the beginning of their confidence steadfast unto the end. Those who submit to the training of Christ will be led by supreme wisdom.--Letter 135, 1903, pp. 5, 6. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, March 8, 1903.)",
