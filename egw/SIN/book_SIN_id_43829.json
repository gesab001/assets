    "word": "Do the smaller duties waiting for you. Thus you will help those who are bearing heavy responsibilities. Use your talents, be they ever so few. God has certainly given you a work to do for Him. And in all you do, keep the Lord Jesus ever before you. Do all to the glory of His name. You belong to God, and you must do His work. Your life is sustained by the Giver of life. Your every capability, therefore, is to be put to use in His service. By using your talents faithfully and wisely, you are gaining power to do better work, to bear heavier responsibilities.",
