    "word": "I cannot give all particulars. I am sick--taken sick last week with severe cold several days ago, and have coughed a great deal. My lungs seem to be congested, but the throat is the worst. I am sorry, because the people could not hear me speak last Sabbath and Sunday. They were so earnest that I rode six miles to San Diego Sunday, but my throat was so congested I could not have voice to speak but 20 minutes. I am coughing and raising [phlegm], and the Lord has graciously sustained me.",
