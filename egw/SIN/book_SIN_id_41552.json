    "word": "Many cases have been shown me in vision where the first evil seed sown in the family was an expression, look, or act of doubt on the part of the wife in regard to her husband's love or his attentions. Nothing can wound a man of integrity like this--to know that she who has given him her hand and has given her life's happiness into his keeping distrusts him, that he has not her entire confidence; that his words, his goings out and his comings in are watched with uneasiness and jealousy; that he cannot act without restraint in the society of friends who visit him; that he cannot be cheerful, happy, or social with his friends; that an eye is upon him and he must act guardedly and restrained. A barrier is soon formed between the two who should have perfect trust in each other; then coldness and neglect follow, and the husband is driven by the jealousy of his wife to find in other society that which he cannot find at home with his wife and children.--Letter 9, 1864, p. 2. (To Sister Howland, March 20, 1864.)",
