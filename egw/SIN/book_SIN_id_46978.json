    "word": "Many remarks have been made to the effect that in our campmeetings the speakers have dwelt upon the law, the law, and not on Jesus. This statement is not strictly true, but have not the people had some reason for making these \n                                                                           891\nremarks? Have not there stood in the desk, as mouthpieces for God, men who had not a genuine experience in heavenly things, men who had not received the righteousness of Christ Jesus? Many of our ministers have merely sermonized, presenting subjects in an argumentative way and scarcely mentioning the saving power of the Redeemer. Not having themselves partaken of the living bread from heaven, their testimony was destitute of nourishment, destitute of the saving blood of Jesus Christ, which cleanseth from all sin. Their offering resembled the offering of Cain. He brought to the Lord the fruit of the ground, which, in itself, was acceptable in God's sight. Very good, indeed, was the fruit, but the virtue of the offering, the blood of Christ, represented by the blood of the slain lamb, was lacking. So it is in Christless sermons. Men are not pricked in the heart; they do not inquire, \"What shall I do to be saved?\"",
