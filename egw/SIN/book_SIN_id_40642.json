    "word": "The knowledge of the way of the Lord is increasing, and will continue to increase. Heresy and superstition are clothing the world in the sackcloth garments of rebellion and transgression. Literature and cheap fiction of every order is circulated like the leaves of autumn; and the minds of thousands are so taken up with irreligious, cheap trash that there is no place in the mind for solid reading. The word of God and all that would elevate man from his degradation is passed by with indifference.--Ms 46, 1897, p. 1. (\"The Entrance of Thy Words Giveth Light,\" May 2, 1897.)",
