    "word": "Seeking Happiness the Wrong Way (counsel to a young man).--One year ago we labored for your interest. \n\n\n                                                   647 \n\nI had been shown your dangers, and we were desirous of saving you; but we see you have not had strength to carry out the resolutions there made. I am troubled over the matter.... While in Battle Creek in June I was again shown that you were not making any advance and that the reason you were not is that you have not made a clean track behind you. You do not enjoy religion. You have departed from God and righteousness. You have been seeking happiness in the wrong way, in forbidden pleasures; and you have not moral courage to confess and forsake your sins that you may find mercy.--2T 291 (1869).",
