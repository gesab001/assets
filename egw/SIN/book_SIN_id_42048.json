    "word": "Christ's Human Nature Like Unto Ours--The human nature of Christ was like unto ours. And suffering was really more keenly felt by Him; for His spiritual nature was free from every taint of sin. The aversion to suffering was in proportion to its severity. His desire for the removal of suffering was just as strong as human beings experience.--Ms 42, 1897, pp. 9, 10. (\"In Gethsemane,\" May 16, 1897.) \n\nWhite Estate, Wash. D. C. January 4, 1982",
