    "word": "The Blessings of Sympathetic Words--O what a power a converted man can exert to bring blessing and gladness to those around him!  Those who bear responsibilities in God's institutions are to grow in grace and in a knowledge of divine things.  Ever they are to remember that the talent of speech is entrusted to them by God for the help and blessing of others.  It is left with them to decide whether they will speak words that will honor Christ, or words that will be a hindrance to those who hear. O what a blessing are pleasant, sympathetic words, words that uplift and strengthen!  When asked a question one should not answer abruptly, but kindly.  The heart of the one that is asking may be sorely grieved by a hidden sorrow, that may not be told.  This he may not know; therefore his words should always be kind and sympathetic.  By a few well-chosen, helpful words, he may remove a heavy load from a fellow worker's mind.--Review and Herald, April 28, 1903.",
