    "word": "The Lord in His providence has brought about the establishment of the Madison school through the efforts of Brethren [E. A.] Sutherland and [P. T.] Magan, and a few faithful associates. Their labors have been performed under no ordinary circumstances. These men had an experience at Berrien Springs which was a severe one, but the Lord brought them safely through it and made it a means of blessing to them. They felt that they must go to the South and labor for this needy field. They went out not knowing whither they were going, and the Lord guided them to Madison, a beautiful place of 400 acres. For a time the way for the establishment of the work seemed hedged up. The Lord led His servants through a trying experience, but He saw the end from the beginning. When some of their brethren expostulated and labored to discourage them, the Lord encouraged. And the results of the efforts put forth at that place we can see; The Lord's blessing has rested upon their efforts.",
