    "word": "NOTHING SO SAD AS A HOME WITHOUT PRAYER.\u2014I know of nothing that causes me so great sadness as a prayerless home. I do not feel safe in such a house for a single night; and were it not for the hope of helping the parents to realize their necessity and their sad neglect, I would not remain. The children show the result of this neglect, for the fear of God is not before them.\u2014(Child Guidance, 518.)",
