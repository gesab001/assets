    "word": "In God's vineyard there is earnest work to be done. The third angel's message is to be proclaimed with a loud voice over the land. Every vestige of business that breeds dishonesty, every thread of selfishness, is to be swept away by the latter rain. All idolatry is to be consumed. Let every altar be thrown down, save the one that sanctifies the gift and the giver--the cross of Calvary.",
