    "word": "Brother Waggoner was highly esteemed on this coast and should not have left. If Brother Jones could have the right starting in, he would make a promising young man, but here again I fear he will not commence right and be balanced by experienced laborers. Brother Jones is young and needs to be molded. He is a conscientious young man; he feels deeply and is sensitive. All these peculiarities are good, but need to be balanced aright. There is no one here to teach him--no one that he can look to for education or example. \n\n\n                                     -242- \n\nI wish he could attend college this winter, and next summer I think he could start in with better understanding and better courage. There is not much here to give a young man courage unless he has a superabundance of it naturally.",
