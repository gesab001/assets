    "word": "This story of Peter's apostasy and its results illustrates the manner of God's dealing with men. Peter himself leaves the fullest record of his own apostasy. This was for the warning of others, that they might avoid falling into a like sin. He knew many who should come after him would feel secure in their own strength, and the honesty of their good intentions and resolves; yet the hour of temptation would find them unarmed by watchfulness and prayer, and they would fall as he had done, because they had not made God their strength.",
