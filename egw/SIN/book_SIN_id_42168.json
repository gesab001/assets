    "word": "Human interpretations, the reception of fables, will spoil your faith, confuse your understanding, and make of none effect your faith in Jesus Christ. Study diligently the third chapter of Revelation. In it is pointed out the danger of losing your hold upon the things that you have heard and learned from the Source of all light. \"Remember . . . how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent\" [Revelation 3:3]. Why repent? Because there have come in faults in the form of theories so subtle that by the influence of mind upon mind--through the agency of those who have departed from the faith--the wily foe will cause you imperceptibly to be imbued with the spirit that will draw you away from the faith.--Letter 230, 1906, pp. 3-4. (To the Elders of the Battle Creek Church, and Ministers and Physicians, July 5, 1906.)",
