    "word": "Until the heart is surrendered unconditionally to God, the human agent is not abiding in the true vine, and can not flourish in the vine, and bear rich clusters of fruit. God will not make the slightest compromise with sin. If he could have done this, Christ need not have come to our world to suffer and die. No conversion is genuine which does not change both the character and the conduct of those who accept the truth. The truth works by love, and purifieth the soul. \n                                                                           1311",
