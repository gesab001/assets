    "word": "All such are represented as coming to the wedding supper without having on the wedding garment, the righteousness of Christ. They have nominally accepted the truth, but they do not practise it. They feel at liberty to come to the supper, but refuse to put on the robe of Christ's righteousness. Professedly circumcised, they are among the uncircumcised in practise, and will be destroyed with the uncircumcised. They have walked with the uncircumcised in their covetousness, and the Lord will not spare them any more than he will the veriest sinner.",
