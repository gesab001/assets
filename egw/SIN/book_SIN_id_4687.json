    "word": "For the Welfare of Others \n\n     In their conduct toward the patients, all should be actuated by higher motives than selfish interest. Everyone should feel that this institution is one of God's instrumentalities to relieve the disease of the body and point the sin-sick soul to Him who can heal both soul and body. In addition to the performance of the special duties assigned them, all should have an interest for the welfare of others. Selfishness is contrary to the spirit of Christianity.--Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 564 (1881). \n\n(292)",
