    "word": "We are to obey the laws of His kingdom, making ourselves all that it is possible for us to be. Earnestly we are to cultivate the highest powers of our being, remembering that we are God's property, God's building. We are required to improve every day. Even in this world of sin and sorrow, we may, by earnest, persevering effort, rise to the highest spiritual efficiency. . . . We are to please God. This we may do; for Enoch pleased God, though living in a degenerate age. And there are Enochs in this our day.",
