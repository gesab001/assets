    "word": "Some who heard Eld. G. preach went home and told their friends that he had come to quarrel with a woman; that they did not like his spirit, and they wanted no more of such meetings. The report went out that two Adventists had come to the valleys, and were quarreling with each other. This was a mistake, as some afterward learned; for there was no response made to his unreasonable and untimely raid. In the ten discourses that I gave in the valleys I made no more reference to Eld. G. than if he had been in his own native State. After giving four or five discourses, he withdrew to other parts, having accomplished little if anything. Many who afterward attended our meetings seemed much surprised and pleased with them. They said they had been entirely misinformed in regard to the nature of our meetings, and expressed much regret that they had not attended them all.",
