    "word": "I rejoice in the completeness of the character of Jesus Christ. He was a compassionate and sympathizing high priest. \"Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself hath suffered being \n\n\n                                    -66- \n\ntempted, He is able to succour them that are tempted.\" (Hebrews 2:17, 18.) \"We have not a High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.\" (Hebrews 4:15.) Oh to only consider how easy it is for hardness of heart to take possession of us. Jesus the Pattern for humanity, must know from painful experience all about a wounded spirit and a broken bleeding heart, and a burdened perplexed and tempted mind.",
