    "word": "Jesus was free from all sin and error; there was not a trace of imperfection in His life or character. He maintained spotless purity under circumstances the most trying. True, He declared, \"There is none good but one, that is, God\"; but again He said, \"I and my Father are one.\" Jesus speaks of Himself as well as the Father as God, and claims for Himself perfect righteousness (MS 141, 1901).",
