    "word": "(Denver, Colorado,) Thursday, July 18, 1872. Thursday morning we awoke in the sleeping cars and looked out of the car window upon snow-capped mountains. Such a scene I had never looked upon before--snow lying upon the top of the mountains, bordered with green. The train bore us to Denver. We stepped off the train about eight o'clock. It was a singular affair for us, to travel hundreds of miles over a barren desert and then find a populous city which could be called the Chicago of Colorado. . . . We were cordially welcomed by our nieces. We felt at home.",
