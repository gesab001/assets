    "word": "\"God who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all things; by whom also He made the worlds; who being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high. Being made so much better than the angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. . . But to which of the angels said He at any time, Sit \n\n\n                            -283- \n\non my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to them that shall be heirs of salvation?\"",
