    "word": "Brethren, I entreat you to move with an eye single to the glory of God. Let his power be your dependence, his grace your strength. By study of the Scriptures, and earnest prayer, seek to obtain clear conceptions of your duty, and then faithfully perform it. It is essential that you cultivate faithfulness in little things, and in thus doing, you will acquire habits of integrity in greater responsibilities. The little incidents of every-day life often pass without our notice; but it is these things that shape the character. Every event of life is great for good or for evil. The mind needs to be trained by daily tests, that it may acquire power to stand in any difficult position. In the days of trial and of peril, you will need to be fortified to stand firmly for the right, independent of every opposing influence. \n                                                                           39",
