    "word": "\"Ministers and all the church, let this be our language, from hearts that respond to the great goodness and love of God to us as a people and to us individually, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and forever.' 'Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God, praise the Lord; for the Lord is good; sing praises unto His name; for it is pleasant. For the Lord \n\n\n                    -3- \n\nhath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for His peculiar treasure. For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.' Consider, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord has a people, a chosen people, His church, to be His own, His own fortress, which He holds in a sin-stricken, revolted world; and He intended that no authority should be known in it, no laws be acknowledged by it, but His own.",
