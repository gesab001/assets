    "word": "As a people we stand reproved of God because so much talent is absorbed in mere commercial interests, while the all-important work of soul-saving is left to languish. Such an intensity of effort should not be given to the manufacture and merchandise of food products, while souls are left to starve for the bread of life. God never designed that the manufacture of foods should be a snare to His people, as it certainly has been. The Lord gave this work to be a blessing to His people, but selfishness and greed and dishonesty have made it productive of great evils. That which God designed to be a blessing has absorbed and diverted from His work valuable talents.",
