    "word": "Moss, Norway, [Tuesday] June 14, 1887. We have another beautiful day. The sun is shining at three o'clock full into my windows. Sister Ings goes today, in company with others, to Christiania, to return this evening. I am feeling more natural today than I have done for four weeks. I praise the Lord for these tokens of God. Our camp meeting people are now leaving for their homes, and business and the council commences today. Brother Sands Lane came yesterday morning.",
