    "word": "Fire, Sacred, Represents God.--The experience of Nadab and Abihu should be a lesson to all who bear any responsibilities in the service of God. An example of unrighteousness greatly dishonors God, and He will not tolerate it. The tenth chapter of Leviticus records the sin of Aaron's sons and their punishment. The sacred fire which God commanded should be used in the service of the sanctuary, represented God. This fire never went out day or night, and this was to be used in all their service. But \"Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not. And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord. Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh Me, and before all the people I will be glorified.\"--Ms 109, 1899. \n\n\n                                     -325-",
