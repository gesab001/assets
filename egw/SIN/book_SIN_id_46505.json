    "word": "Now here are the people of God and God wants you to be getting ready for the great day of salvation, that you may be getting others ready. He wants you to have a fitting-up, that you may have a message for the people that will cut its way through the fleshy heart, and that you may go crying through the porch and the altar, \"Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach\" (Joel 2:17). Now open your ears to the truth you have had and put away your doubts, unbelief, and Christless surmisings.",
