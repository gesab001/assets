    "word": "About six o'clock in the morning we reached Basle. Here we were met at the train by friends, and taken at once to the office of Les Signes des Temps, where we met old friends whom we had not seen for years. We are much pleased with the location of the new publishing house. While sufficiently near the center of the town for all business purposes, it is far enough out to avoid the noise and confusion of the city. The building faces the south, and directly opposite is a sixty-acre common of government land, bordered by trees. On the other side of the common are large buildings, behind which rise gently sloping hills covered with green fields and pretty groves. On one of the hills directly opposite us stands a quaint little church, and an old convent long since deserted, and occupied now only by a farmer. Back of all this rise higher mountains, covered with dark firs and forming a fine background to the lovely scene.",
