    "word": "MR No. 349 - Attitudes Toward Sunday Laws\n\n     There have arisen in our Conference [The General Conference of 1889] questions that need to have careful attention, whether the Sabbath-keepers in the Southern States where they are liable to feel the oppressive power of their State laws if they labor on Sunday shall rest on Sunday to avoid the persecution which must come if they do any labor. Some of our brethren seem anxious that a resolution shall be passed by the General Conference advising our Sabbath-keeping brethren liable to imprisonment and fines, to refrain from labor on that day. Such resolutions should not be placed before this Conference requiring their action.",
