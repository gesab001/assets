    "word": "The Lord has presented before me that those who have been in any measure blinded by the enemy, and who have not fully recovered themselves from the snare of Satan, will be in peril because they cannot discern the light from heaven, and will be inclined to accept a falsehood. This will affect the whole tenor of their thoughts, their decisions, their propositions, their counsels. The evidences that God has given are no evidence to them, because they have blinded their own eyes by choosing darkness rather than light. Then they will originate something they call light, which the Lord calls sparks of their own kindling, by which they will direct their steps. The Lord declares, \"Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? Let him, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with \n\n\n                         - 18 - \n\nsparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have at mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.\" Jesus said, \"For judgment I am come unto this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.\" \"I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.\" \"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.\"",
