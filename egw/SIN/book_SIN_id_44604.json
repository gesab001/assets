    "word": "Men of true education are scarce. Men of talent are numerous, but they do not improve their opportunities, and their talents do not increase. When men and women hunger after knowledge for the purpose of blessing their fellow men, God will bless them. He will prepare the new bottles for the new wine. \n\n\n                                     -246- \n\nThere will be an expansion, a development of the higher faculties, so that men will become deep thinkers. If the men who have talents would not settle down satisfied that they have sufficient for the great work; if they would dig deeper, there would not be such a dearth of laborers. We should have more spiritual teaching, and the hidden treasure would by diligent effort be brought to the surface. \"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering\" [Hebrews 10:22, 23].",
