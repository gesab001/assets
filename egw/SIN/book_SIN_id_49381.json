    "word": "Students, understand that you have not been appointed by the Lord to be an informer. Your work is to study your Bible and the other branches of education, as for your life. Do not make it your business to be a talebearer. As matters are reported, each one makes the report a little more pronounced or varied, and thus painful discrepancies cause many to form wrong conclusions. Therefore guard well your words; put a bridle on your tongue. If you allow yourself to become a talebearer, you will not be welcome in any family, because of your propensity to report every transaction that may occur. I have decided that it is unsafe for me to visit, not because I am guilty of any known wrong, but because something will be said or inferred that will be misrepresented; and therefore I prefer to remain at home. \n\n\n                                  (Signed) Mrs. E. G. White",
