    "word": "This work will require devoted men and means, and much wise planning. Years ago we should have been training colored men and women to care for the sick. Plans should now be made to do a quick work. Let promising colored young men\u2014young men of good Christian character\u2014be given a thorough training for this line of service. Let them be imbued with the thought that in all their work they are to proclaim the third angel\u2019s message. Strong, intelligent, consecrated colored nurses will find a wide field of usefulness opening before them.",
