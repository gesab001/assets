    "word": "We are living in the last days. The closing scenes of this world's history, which our Saviour foretold would take place just prior to His \n\n\n             -179- \n\ncoming, are now being enacted before us. Concerning this time He said, \"As the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\" The inhabitants of the antediluvian world were utterly unconcerned, and at the appointed time the flood came and took them all away. Had they believed the warning given by Noah, they would not have risked everything by going on in wickedness. Notwithstanding their unbelief, destruction came. Unbelief will not change the certainty of Christ's second coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.",
