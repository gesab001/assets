    "word": "My brethren, I feel great sorrow of heart. I shall not appear before you again in our general gatherings unless I am impressed by the Spirit of God that I should. The last General Conference that I attended gave you all the evidence \n\n\n                                  -196- \n\nthat you will ever have in any meeting that shall be convened. If that meeting did not convince you that God is working by His Spirit through His humble servant, it is because the candlestick has been removed out of its place. I thought that after the last General Conference there would be a change of heart, but during that meeting the work was not done that ought to have been done that God might come in, nor has this work been done since that time. God is knocking at the door of the heart; but as yet the door has not opened to let Him enter and take full possession of the soul-temple.",
