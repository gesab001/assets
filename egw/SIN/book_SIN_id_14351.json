    "word": "The church, soon to enter upon her most severe conflict, will be the object most dear to God upon earth. The confederacy of evil will be stirred with power from beneath, and Satan will cast all the reproach possible upon the chosen ones whom he cannot deceive and delude with his satanic inventions and falsehoods. But exalted \"to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins,\" will Christ, our representative and head, close His heart, or withdraw His hand, or falsify His promise? No; never, never.",
