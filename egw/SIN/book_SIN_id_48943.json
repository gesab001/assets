    "word": "Never was there a time when truth and righteousness should be so highly exalted by those who are in God's service as the present. Let us urge upon our people the necessity of laying hold upon the foundation principles of the truth. Oh, there are so many who fail to enjoy the blessing that comes from a clear conviction of what the people of God must be. There is nothing in self upon which it is safe to rest. In the place of being confused in regard to the foundation of our faith, which has been confirmed by the power of the Holy Spirit, in the place of building flimsy foundations upon the sands of error, let us hold fast to the great principles of truth given us, refusing to be moved. Those who receive theories of Satan's furnishings are building upon the sand. When the storm and tempest come, their building will suddenly collapse, and great will be the fall of it.",
