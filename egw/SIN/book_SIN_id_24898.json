    "word": "Now, as in former ages, the presentation of a truth that reproves the errors and sins of the times, will call forth a storm of opposition. \"Every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.\" [John 3:20.] Those who cannot sustain their position by the Scriptures are stubbornly determined that it shall be sustained at all hazards, and with a malicious spirit they attack the character and motives of those who stand in defense of unpopular truth. Though very unbelieving in regard to the sure word of prophecy, they manifest the utmost credulity in accepting anything detrimental to the Christian integrity of those who dare to reprove fashionable sins. This spirit will increase more and more as we near the close of time. \n                                                                           293",
