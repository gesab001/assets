    "word": "Jesus does not willingly give sorrow to a single soul. Let us learn of Him how to manifest a tender affection. His promises will never fail; in Him we have an unchanging friend. Let us now take hold to glorify, not self, but Christ; then the light of His presence will shine upon us, illuminating all the way.",
