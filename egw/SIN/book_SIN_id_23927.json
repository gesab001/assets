    "word": "When Joseph was tempted to deviate from the path of right, to transgress the law of God and prove untrue to his master, he firmly resisted, and gave evidence of the elevating power of the fear of God, in his answer to his master's wife. After speaking of the great confidence of his master in him, by intrusting all that he had with him, he exclaims, \"How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\" He would not be persuaded to deviate from the path of righteousness, and trample upon God's law, by any inducements or threats. And when he was accused, and a base crime was falsely laid to his charge, he did not sink in despair. In the consciousness of innocence and right, he still trusted in God. And God, who had hitherto supported him, did not forsake him. He was bound with fetters, and kept in a gloomy prison. Yet God turned even \n                                                                           132\nthis misfortune into a blessing. He gave him favor with the keeper of the prison, and to Joseph was soon committed the charge of all the prisoners.",
