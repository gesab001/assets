    "word": "Genuine religion brings its sanctifying influence into all a man thinks, says, and does. Let everyone connected with you, my brother, see that you are discharging aright the duties God has laid upon you, that you are keeping your heart free from every scheme of selfishness.

You may be sure that these must be purged away if, in that work that is a right work, you strive lawfully. Loving God supremely and your neighbor as Christ has loved you, you fulfill the divine law. In any business transaction, in any line of service, be sure that not one thread of selfishness is drawn into the fabric.",
