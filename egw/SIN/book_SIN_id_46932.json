    "word": "The habit that some who claim to be preachers of the gospel have, to pass sentence upon everything with which they do not agree, has a demoralizing influence upon their own religious experience, and upon all who have confidence in them. God gives no one the work of sitting in judgment upon their neighbors and communicating their decisions far and wide. When they extend their words and influence against men whom God is using to do a special work, and they set themselves in dead earnest against those of whose motives and whose religious standing they know nothing to condemn, they do a work similar to that which Satan is doing. They knew nothing about the motives which impel certain actions which they take up and talk of so glibly. All facts that should be considered under the influence of the Spirit of God are glibly pronounced upon as if they themselves were men whose judgment was sound and unquestionable. \n                                                                           838",
