    "word": "Christ was always ready to answer the sincere inquirer after truth. When His disciples came to Him for an explanation of some word He had spoken to the multitude, He gladly repeated His lesson. They grieved Him by contending for the supremacy. But instead of giving them a harsh rebuke, He took a little child, and setting him in the midst of them, He said, \"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven\" [Matthew 18:3, 4].",
