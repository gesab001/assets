    "word": "The sixth chapter of First Timothy speaks of a class of people who dishonor God. In the place of seeking for purity of heart, for love and unity, thus revealing that the leaven of truth has been hidden in their souls, they give evidence that they know not what it means to have the leaven of truth in the heart, molding the affections and sanctifying the soul. They are proud, \"knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings. Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness\" [verses 4, 5]. \"From such\" the apostle warns Timothy, \"withdraw thyself.\" [Verses 6-10, quoted.]",
