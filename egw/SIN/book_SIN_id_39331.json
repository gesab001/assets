    "word": "When I see Christian women leading out in temperance campaigns, presenting to the liquor inebriate a pledge to abstain from all intoxicating drinks, I think it would also be well for them to present to every Christian woman a pledge to abstain from all needless display and extravagance in dress, for the bondage of a woman to fashion is usually as great as is the bondage of a liquor inebriate to his appetite. By dressing simply, thus saving time and means, Christian women can do more to encourage and sustain the cause of temperance than by anything else. The means thus saved will clothe the destitute, feed the hungry, and close a most effectual door against the temptation of drunkenness.",
