    "word": "On Sunday there was a large company assembled, and I was never more free than upon this occasion. Those who came to hear were enthusiastic over it. They had been making an effort to put down the licensing of liquor selling. They failed. They said, If Mrs. White had come there a week before and spoken in their cities they should have succeeded in putting down the sale of liquor. They said they would have given her $25.00 a night. I found here it would have been a terrible disappointment if I had failed here. I feel sure this was my duty. We gave great encouragement to the Bourdeaus.",
