    "word": "It is the Lord who has made Elder Daniells the man that he is, and when Sister Daniells takes the credit for this, she dishonors God. Often she has stood in Elder Daniells' way, discouraging and depressing him, because she was not walking in truth and righteousness. She has cherished in her heart the grievous sin of jealousy. This has separated her from the Saviour. She has been unjust to her husband, and unjust to others. She had no reason to feel as she did, for Elder Daniells is not guilty. But she has accepted Satan's temptations as the truth. Thus she has lost her peace of mind, and has taken a course which has disparaged her in the eyes of her brethren and sisters, and which has brought alienation between her and her husband. Elder Daniells would be received into the hearts of the believers in New Zealand if Sister Daniells were a humble, discreet woman. She must learn at the feet of Jesus to be meek \n\n\n                                     -122- \n\nand lowly. Unless she does this, she will be a great hindrance to her husband.",
