    "word": "The Character of the Work. \n\n     The school at Madison not only educates in a knowledge of the Scriptures, but it gives a practical training that fits the student to go forth as a self-supporting missionary to the field to which he is called. In his student days he is taught how to build simply and substantially, how to cultivate the land, and care for the stock. To this is added the knowledge of being able to treat the sick and care for the injured. This training for medical missionary work is one of the grandest objects for which any school can be established. There are many suffering from diseases and injury, who, when relieved of pain, will be prepared to listen to the truth. Our Saviour was a mighty Healer. In his name there may be many miracles wrought in the South and other fields through the instrumentality of the trained medical missionary. Therefore it is essential that there shall be a sanitarium connected with the Madison school. The educational work at the school, and at the Sanitarium, can go forward hand in hand. The instruction given at the school will benefit the patients, and the instruction given to the sanitarium patients will be a blessing to the school.",
