    "word": "He who gave His only-begotten Son to die for you, has made a covenant with you. He gives you His blessings, and in return He requires you to bring Him your tithes and offerings. No one will ever dare to say that there was no way in which he could understand in regard to this matter. God's plan regarding tithes and offerings is definitely stated in the third chapter of Malachi. God calls upon His human agents to be true to the contract He has made with them. \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,\" He says, \"that there may be meat in Mine house.\"--R. & H., Dec. 3, 1901.",
