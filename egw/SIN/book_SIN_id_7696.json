    "word": "Avoid Business Entanglements.--We are to be workers together with Him. Those who are in His service need to separate from all business entanglements that would tarnish their Christlikeness of character. The fishermen that the Saviour called, straightway left their nets. Those who give themselves to the work of the ministry must not entangle themselves in business lines that will bring a coarseness into their lives and will be a detriment to their spiritual advancement in the work of the Lord has given them to do.--Letter 53, 1905.",
