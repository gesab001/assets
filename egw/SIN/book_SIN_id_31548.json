    "word": "\"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\" Here is language that expresses His mind toward a corrupt and idolatrous people: \"How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver \n                                                                           246\nthee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within Me, My repentings are kindled together.\" Must He give up the people for whom such a provision has been made, even His only-begotten Son, the express image of Himself? God permits His Son to be delivered up for our offenses. He Himself assumes toward the Sin Bearer the character of a judge, divesting Himself of the endearing qualities of a father.",
