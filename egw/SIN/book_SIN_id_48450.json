    "word": "The Life of Faith \n\n     We are to live a life of faith in Jesus Christ. That love that He has manifested for us is to be an increasing love. Self must die. We find that this is hard; for self dies hard. It is not our work to uphold self. \"Without Me,\" Christ says, \"ye can do nothing.\" The life of grace is always a life of faith. Without faith it is impossible to please God.",
