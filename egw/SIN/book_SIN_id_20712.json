    "word": "As these words were spoken, I saw that some turned sadly away and mingled with the scoffers. Others, with tears, all broken in heart, made confession to those whom they had bruised and wounded. They did not think of maintaining their own dignity, but asked at every step, \"What must I do to be saved?\" (Acts 16:30). The answer was, \"Repent, and be converted, that your sins may go beforehand to judgment, and be blotted out.\" Words were spoken which rebuked spiritual pride. This God will not tolerate. It is inconsistent with His Word and with our profession of faith. Seek the Lord, all ye who are ministers of His. Seek Him while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near. \"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon\" (Isaiah 55:7).",
