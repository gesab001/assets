    "word": "Angels of mercy seemed whispering, \"Look up. This glory is but a gleam of the light which flows from the throne of God. Live not for earth alone. Look up, and behold by faith the mansions of the heavenly home.\" This scene was to me as the bow of promise to Noah, enabling me to grasp the assurance of God's unfailing care and to look forward to the haven of rest awaiting the faithful worker. Ever since that time I have felt that God granted us this token of His love for our encouragement. Never while memory lingers can I forget that vision of beauty and the comfort and peace it brought.",
