    "word": "We should take heed to the lessons which Christ has given to His disciples. The disciples asked Jesus, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" [Matthew 18:1; verses 2-7, quoted]. The religion of the Bible is to guide the conduct of everyone who sincerely believes in Christ. The Bible must guide us in our dealings in daily life. We may make a profession of being followers of Christ, and yet if we are not doers of His Word we shall be like the counterfeit coin. We shall not have the right ring.",
