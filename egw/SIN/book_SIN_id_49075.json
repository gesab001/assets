    "word": "I have spoken to you the truth because I dare not withhold it. My words are not designed to discourage, but to open before you the fact that although you may have good business qualities and tact, yet something higher than this is necessary in the work in which you are engaged. You may become men as valuable as gold, and this is why I have written as I have. Your character must reflect the character of Christ. \n\n\n                                (Signed) Ellen G. White (Copied, W.F.C., November 27, 1894) \n\n                                               -",
