    "word": "Many who profess to be looking for the speedy coming of Christ, are becoming conformed to this world, and seek more earnestly the applause of those around them, than the approbation of God. They are cold and formal, like the nominal church, that they but a short time since separated from. The words addressed to the Laodicean Church, describe their present condition perfectly. See Revelation 3:14-20. They are \"neither cold nor hot,\" but \"lukewarm.\" And unless they heed the counsel of the \"faithful and True Witness,\" and zealously repent, and obtain \"gold tried in the fire,\" \"white raiment,\" and \"eye-salve,\" he will spue them out of his mouth.",
