    "word": "My brother, you are in a strait place, but the Lord will be your frontguard and your rearward if you will put your trust in Him. Do not let unsanctified, unconsecrated men lead you or intimidate you. I have been instructed that it is time that there was a thorough investigation of the standing of the Medical Missionary Association and the Sanitarium. Let the strict examination be made in regard to the business that has been transacted in Battle Creek. This will show the standing of the institution. This investigation should have been made long ago. The business standing of all our medical institutions is to be carefully and correctly presented before our people, that they may know the real situation of the medical work, where it stands, what it is doing, whether or not it is producing as well as consuming.",
