    "word": "Man's inventions and traditions are not only unreliable, but dangerous, for they place men where God should be. They place the sayings of men where a \"Thus saith the Lord\" should be. The world's Redeemer possesses the key, and unlocks the treasure house of the Old Testament. He explores hidden things. He separates the precious truth from superstition and error and the devisings and imaginings of men.",
