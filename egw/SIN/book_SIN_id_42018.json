    "word": "Sincerity Does Not Guarantee Rightness--The idea is entertained by many that a man may practice anything that he conscientiously believes to be right. But the question is: Has the man a well-instructed, good conscience, or is it biased and warped by his own preconceived opinions? Conscience is not to take the place of \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Consciences do not all harmonize and are not all inspired alike. Some consciences are dead, seared as with a hot iron. Men may be conscientiously wrong, as well as conscientiously right. Paul did not believe in Jesus of Nazareth, and he hunted the Christians from city to city, verily believing that he was doing service to God.",
