    "word": "When the Lord was about to smite Egypt with hail, He said to Moses, \"Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been seen in Egypt since the foundation thereof until now. Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die\" [Exodus 9:18, 19].",
