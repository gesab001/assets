    "word": "Then I left Battle Creek for Petoskey. I spoke there every Sabbath for eight weeks, except one Sabbath, besides three evenings. I had great freedom. The Blessing of the Lord rested upon me and the hearers. Twice I spoke at Harbor Point, fourteen miles from Petoskey. I have spoken once in the Sanitarium, last Sunday night, with much freedom. I attend meetings in the small churches, but feel that I have no strength to labor with the church who have had my testimony so abundantly, and yet have set themselves against my message, and have not been moved to change their position of resistance, notwithstanding all the Lord has given me to say in demonstration of the Spirit and power. I have no hope that they could be helped by anything I should say further. They have resisted the appeals of the Spirit of God. I have no hope that the Lord has a reserve power to break down their resistance. I leave them in the hands of God, and unless the Lord places upon me a decided burden to speak words in the tabernacle, I shall not attempt to say anything until those who have acted a part to hedge up my way shall clear my path. If they have not recognized the Spirit of the Lord in the messages I have borne, they will recognize it less now, for I have not strength to contend with the spirit of resistance, the doubts and unbelief, which have barricaded their souls, that they could not see when good cometh. I have far greater liberty in speaking to unbelievers, They are interested. They feel impressed by the Spirit of God, and say, It seems those words are spoken under the inspiration of the Spirit of God. O, it is the hardest place in the world to speak where great light has come \n                                                                           710\nto men in responsible positions. They have been enlightened, but have chosen darkness rather than light.",
