    "word": "Christ Moved With Compassion.--When Christ saw the multitudes that gathered about Him, \"He was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.\" Christ saw the sickness, the sorrow, the want and degradation of the multitudes that thronged His steps. To Him were presented the needs and woes of humanity throughout the world. Among the high and the low, the most honored and the most degraded, He beheld souls who were longing for the very blessings He had come to bring. . . .",
