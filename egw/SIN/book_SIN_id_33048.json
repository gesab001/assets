    "word": "The blind and deaf rejoiced in His presence. The face of Christ was the first face that many eyes had ever looked upon; His words the first that had ever fallen upon their ears. These, restored, followed Him wherever it was possible. His words to the ignorant opened to them a fountain of life. He dispensed His blessings abundantly and continuously; they were the garnered treasures of eternity, given in Christ, the Lord's rich gifts to man.",
