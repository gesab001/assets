    "word": "No man is excusable for being without financial ability. Of many a man it may be said, He is kind, amiable, generous, a good man and a Christian, but he is not qualified to manage his own business. So far as the proper outlay of means is concerned, he is a mere child. He has not been educated by his parents \n                                                                           31\nto understand and practise the principles of self support. Such a man is not fitted to become a minister or a physician. The churches everywhere are suffering through the neglect of parents to train their children to bear hard, stern responsibilities.",
