    "word": "The transgression of our first parents was the cause of woe to our world. We have had to labor under the oppressive load of sin ever since that sin. But a provision was made for the fallen race. The Son of God has opened a way of escape for the ruined race by taking the transgressions of man and their just penalty upon Himself. He laid aside His robes of royalty, clothed His divinity with humanity, and came into our world. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. He suffered insult and reproach and mockery, and yet He was the Majesty of heaven.",
