    "word": "Since last Tuesday, September 28, we have been staying at the new school, situated about six miles from my home, and five miles from the St. Helena Sanitarium. The dedication service was held on September 20, when the chapel was filled with students and visitors. There were forty-five students present on opening day. Our people were deeply interested in this place we have purchased. Several of our leading brethren were present, and all gave expression to their appreciation of this property and to their thankfulness to God for His providential leading. It was the unanimous opinion that in the Angwin estate we have secured a most desirable location for our conference school. Among those who spoke were Prof. Irwin, Elders Haskell, Corliss, Knox, Tait, Cottrell, and W. C. White.",
