    "word": "Almost my whole lifetime has been devoted to this work, but my burden has often been made heavier by the arising of men who went forth to proclaim a message that God had not given them.

When it is made manifest that their message is error, then the Testimonies brought into the companionship of error, share the same condemnation; and people of the world, who do not know that the Testimonies quoted are extracts from private letters used without my consent, present these matters as evidence that my work is not of God, or of truth, but falsehood. Those who thus bring the work of God into disrepute will have to answer before God for the work they are doing.",
