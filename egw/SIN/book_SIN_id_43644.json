    "word": "Men have lost the life of God by opposing those who have received a message from heaven. God calls for workers who will wrestle earnestly for the prize of eternal life. The Spirit of God must come to every gospel worker, to every church member, if those who are perishing in sin are [to be] saved to Christ. The crown of life is gained by those who run with patience the race set before them.",
