    "word": "Last night I received increased light. The words were spoken to me that were spoken to Joshua: \"Why \n\n\n                                     -164- \n\nare you full of distress and anguish? Arise and set things in order. There has been falsehood and dissembling and iniquitous practices. God cannot bless His people until these sins are put away from among you.\" The lessons that you have given by precept and example have done a work, the results of which eternity alone will reveal, while you were concealing your own wrongs. You have imparted all you knew that was faulty in others, purely out of bitterness and revenge, which strengthened and confirmed him [Brother G] to vindicate his unrighteous course, when you yourself were a far greater sinner in the sight of God.",
