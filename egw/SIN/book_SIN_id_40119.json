    "word": "The gospel fits all periods and all relations of life. No man can separate fellowship with God from a life of holiness. Sanctification takes in the whole being. Many in this our day claim fellowship with God while by their lives they deny their claim. \"If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.\" To walk in the light is to know and obey the truth. To have fellowship with one another is to treat one another as children of God.--Letter 21, 1901, pp. 13, 14. (To Elder E. E. Franke, October 5, 1900.)",
