    "word": "Some of the Jews had brought to Jesus the story of the Galileans whom Pilate had slain at the foot of the altar, thinking that it was because of their wickedness that this had happened unto them, and that they were deservedly suffering for their sins. But the great Teacher had a lesson for his hearers. He said unto them, \"Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, Nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all the men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell ye, Nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\"",
