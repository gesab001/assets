    "word": "There is in the Echo office work enough to keep all very busy. This is made an excuse for the workers to think that they have no time to ask the Lord to aid in all the work being accomplished. An angel was represented to me as passing through the office, examining every part of the machinery and the quality of the work being done there. The words were spoken, Have you thought what this hurry and anxiety amounts to? What is the end and object of much that you are doing? What will be the harvest of this kind of seed sowing? The young men and women apprentices in the office require diligent culture. The faculties of mind and body which develop by exercise require that kind of teaching that will lead the workers to be co-laborers with God to do His work.",
