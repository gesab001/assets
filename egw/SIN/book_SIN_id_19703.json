    "word": "Certain Books to Be \"Abundantly Illustrated.\"-- Many lines of business will open up as the work is carried forward. There is much work to be done in the South, and in order to do this work the laborers must have suitable literature, books telling the truth in simple language, and abundantly illustrated. This kind of literature will be the most effective means of keeping the truth before the people. A sermon may be preached and soon forgotten, but a book remains.--LS 381, 382. (See LS 213, 214.)",
