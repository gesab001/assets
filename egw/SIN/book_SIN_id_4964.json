    "word": "There is much deception carried on under the cover of religion. Passion controls the minds of many who have become depraved in thought and feeling in consequence of \"pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness.\" Ezekiel 16:49. These deceived souls flatter themselves that they are spiritually minded and especially consecrated, when their religious experience consists in a sickly sentimentalism rather than in purity, true goodness, and humiliation of self. The mind should be drawn away from self; its powers should be exercised in devising means to make others happier and better. \"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\" James 1:27.",
