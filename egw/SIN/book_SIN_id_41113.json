    "word": "MR No. 580 - Powerful Witnessing\n\n     The truth that we are to proclaim is that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. This truth is to be developed in the closing scenes of this earth's history--that the Crucified One, though unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the supposedly wise men foolishness, is nevertheless the power of God and the wisdom of God. Those who receive Christ as a personal Saviour, will stand the test of trial in these last days.",
