    "word": "In the word of God I find these promises, \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah. Not according to that which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord. But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be My people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them even unto the greatest, saith the Lord; for I will (533) forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.\"",
