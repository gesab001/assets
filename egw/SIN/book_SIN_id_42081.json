    "word": "Many are bearing a yoke that Christ never placed upon them. It is galling to the neck, and it brings no rest to the soul. I said to Brother A, The Lord has not placed the sins of the people upon you. You are not the sin-bearer. Jesus, the world's Redeemer, was able to tread the wine press alone. He bore our sins in His own body on the tree, and there is not an angel in heaven who is able to bear the sins of one soul. No human being can bear the guilt of his own sin. Then how inconsistent for him to think that the Lord has laid upon him the sins of his fellow men. If it were so indeed, his life would be crushed out. From henceforth please remember that not one of you is able to be a sin-bearer. Do not feel that you are under the necessity of talking of the faults and errors of others.",
