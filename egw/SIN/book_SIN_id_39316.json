    "word": "I am much pained at heart to see your course of action. If I should judge you by the fruits you bear I should suppose you were not a tree in the Lord's garden, but a bramble bush. I supposed when you were connected with Homer that you would be a blessing to him as a soldier of Christ, leading him to Jesus while the sweet invitation of mercy is heard; that you would listen to its voice yourself and draw Homer to the attractive loveliness of Jesus Christ. We see you working in entirely an opposite line from this. Had it not been for the influence that you have had over him I have not a doubt but that he would have been seeking the Lord most earnestly and repenting of his sin. I am deeply disappointed in you.",
