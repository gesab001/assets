    "word": "Pray as did Daniel\u2014three times a day, alone with God. Confess every sin you have committed, every mistake you have made. . . . God says, \u201cConfess your faults one to another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed.\u201d Thus you have built barriers between yourself and sin. You are walking in harmony with God. He has avouched Himself as one who will hear and answer your sincere prayers. He has assured you that He will pardon and accept you. How powerful you may be in this assurance! The Lord is near to all who call upon Him\u2014near to answer and to bless.\u2014Letter 134, 1901.",
