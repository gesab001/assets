    "word": "My brother, I am not pleased to have you feel as you do in regard to Brethren Waggoner, Jones, and Prescott. Had these men had the cooperation of our ministering brethren, and had they drawn in even cords, the work would be years in advance of what it is now. It is not pleasing to the Lord for you to retain the feelings you do in these matters. You have a special branch of the work, which is your part of the vineyard to cultivate according to your ability. And to these men the Lord has given their work. They have another part of the vineyard to cultivate. They are not fitted to do your work, neither are you fitted to do their work. To every man is given his work according to his ability. They must work in their line, and you must work in your line. They are not required to do your work; you are not required to do their work.",
