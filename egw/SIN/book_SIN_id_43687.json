    "word": "We are now to prepare for the marriage supper of the Lamb. We are to give the message everywhere, in the highways and the hedges, to high and low, rich and poor.

God would have us make decided plans to keep as far as possible from the snares that await those who enter largely into food speculations. We must pray, and watch unto prayer, and we must find out the real results of the restaurant work. \n\n\n                                 -297-",
