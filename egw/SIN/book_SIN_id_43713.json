    "word": "Today I went down and selected one of those earthen stoves for my room, which is the parlor. I cannot keep warm with the coils, and the iron stove makes me feel continually oppressed. Have had nosebleed nearly every day since I came home. This stove is on the same principle as those white ones in Sweden, but this one we have purchased is about five feet high, brown earthenware. It is a beauty for $20; they asked $22. So you see we shall be nicely fixed here for the winter.",
