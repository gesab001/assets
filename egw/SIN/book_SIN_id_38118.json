    "word": "The young Hayward is a boy who can be moulded if surrounded by correct influences. This boy needs right example. If the young who profess Christ would honor him in their lives they could exert an influence to counteract the pernicious influence of such youth as George Warren. But the youth generally have no more religion than those who have never named the name of Christ. They do not depart from iniquity. A smart, intelligent boy, like George Warren, can have a powerful influence for evil. If this intelligence were controlled by rectitude and virtue, it would be powerful for good; but if it is swayed by depravity, its evil cannot be estimated upon his associates, and it will assuredly sink him in perdition.",
