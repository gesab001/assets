    "word": "The work of God demands most earnest labor, and the Lord would have ministers and their wives closely united in this work. The husband and wife can so blend their labor that the wife shall be the complement of the husband. The Lord desires them unitedly to watch for his voice, to draw closer and still closer to Him, feeding upon his Word, and receiving light and blessing to impart to others. They should be as free as possible to attend \n\n\n                                   -115- \n\ncamp-meetings and other general gatherings. And the wife may continually be a great help to her husband in visiting, and other personal labor.",
