    "word": "Spiritual guides whose spiritual eyesight is blinded, tamper with the conscience, and by subtle reasoning make imaginary and false distinctions between the guilt of various transactions. They lightly pass over some very great wrongs, \n                                                                           1767\nand with great severity condemn other wrongs that do not begin to compare with the enormity of their own sin in creating and working upon false principles. God calls for a decided and thorough change.",
