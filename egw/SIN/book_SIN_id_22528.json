    "word": "7 (chs. 1:7; 2:7, 8; Romans 3:24; Titus 2:11). What Is Grace?--The Lord saw our fallen condition; He saw our need of grace, and because He loved our souls, He has given us grace and peace. Grace means favor to one who is undeserving, to one who is lost. The fact that we are sinners, instead of shutting us away from the mercy and love of God, makes the exercise of His love to us a positive necessity in order that we may be saved (ST June 5, 1893).",
