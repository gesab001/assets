    "word": "The pressure of work, and the wearing anxiety in connection with the Office, was telling upon my husband. Home matters were neglected. His father and mother who were with us could receive but little attention from him personally. But that which grieved him most was the letters of discouragement coming from Brn. Waggoner and Andrews while he was standing under an almost insupportable weight of care and labor. My husband, by the help of God, improved the Review by enlarging it; also the Instructor. He resurrected the Reformer, which was apparently dead. He performed the labor which should have been shared with no less than three besides himself. And at the General Conference which followed this exhausting labor, there was additional care and burdens which nearly finished him. He \n                                                                           220\nhad a slight shock of paralysis. Since that time, he has been standing under continual pressure of care and heavy, wearing responsibilities. He has had no time to revise tracts for other languages, or to write upon subjects of present truth. The blame of publications not being given to the French people does not rest upon my husband, for he positively could not do this work in addition to the accumulation of burdens which unjustly fell upon him. He has stood under the burdens that no other man would lift.",
