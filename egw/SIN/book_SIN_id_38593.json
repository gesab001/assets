    "word": "I know your danger. If you lose confidence in the testimonies, you will drift away from Bible truth. I was fearful that many would take the very position of questioning doubt they are now taking, and, in my distress for your souls; I warned you. How many will heed the warning? As you now hold the testimonies, should one be given crossing your track, correcting your errors, you would feel at perfect liberty to accept or reject any part, or the whole. And that which you will be least inclined to receive, is the very part most needed. God and Satan never work in co-partnership. The testimonies either bear the signet of God or that of Satan. A good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. By their fruit ye shall know them. God has spoken. Who has trembled at his word?",
