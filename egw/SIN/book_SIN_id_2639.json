God is testing and proving you. He has been giving His blessings to you with a lavish hand, and is now watching to see what use you are making of them, to see if you will help those who need help, and if you will \n                                                                           222\nfeel the worth of souls, and do what you can with the means that He has intrusted to you. Every such opportunity improved adds to your heavenly treasure.--Testimonies, vol. 3, pp. 249, 250.",
