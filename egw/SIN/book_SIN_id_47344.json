    "word": "Chap. 157 - To Brethren Who Shall Assemble in General Conference\n\n     (Written October 21, 1894, from Ashfield, NSW, \"To the Brethren Who Shall Assemble in General Conference\" [Feb. 15 to March 4, 1895].) \n\n\n     I have a burden upon my mind which I cannot lay off. The home field needs wise men in its councils. \"Without Me,\" said Christ, \"ye can do nothing.\" We can well spare the work of men who are without the imparted wisdom of God, and the sooner this is done the better it will be for the president of the General Conference and for the other members of the Conference, who must carry the work in straight lines, making clean, thorough records and straight laws for the methods and plans of the other conferences. The General Conference needs to consider well whom it places upon its boards as counsellors and planners, for the voice and influence of those whom they select will have much to do in the shaping of the work.  Year after year men who are not in touch with the all-wise and unerring Counsellor are placed in leading positions. Too long these men have been entrusted with sacred interests. They have not grown with the advance and development of the truth; they have not waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom and the grace of God. They are selfish and opinionated, and have come to look upon their positions in the cause of God as they would upon common business transactions. They have lost a sense of the sacredness of the work. \n                                                                           1287",
