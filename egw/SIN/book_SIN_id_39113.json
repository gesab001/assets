    "word": "There are physicians who because of a past connection with our sanitariums find it profitable to locate close to them; and they close their eyes to the great fields neglected and unworked in which unselfish labor would be a blessing to many. Missionary physicians can exert an uplifting, refining, sanctifying influence. Physicians who do not do this abuse their power, and do a work that the Lord repudiates. Letter 233, 1905, pp. 8, 12. (To Dr. and Mrs. D. H. Kress, August 9, 1905.)",
