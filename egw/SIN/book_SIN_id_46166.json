    "word": "I have been forced to inquire why several of our canvassers in this field who were canvassing for \"Home Hand Book\" have left the field having only paid their expenses. Some did not even do this. They stated that when the time came for them to deliver their books, they could not obtain copies to deliver. They were themselves greatly disappointed, and the people who \n\n\n                            -30- \n\nwere expecting the books were also disappointed. What shall we do about this? I have talked with the men at the Echo Office about it, and they say that they can not obtain copies of \"Home Hand Book\".",
