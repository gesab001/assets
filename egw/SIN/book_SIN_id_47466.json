    "word": "The lack of consecration and self-denial on the part of leading men, their spurious devotion, has been made manifest in the grasping of the high wages, and in their resistance to the messages that God has sent. They have continually and persistently turned from these warnings, and yet you have given them influence, you have linked up and together, and sent them to different localities to transact business, giving the impression that they were the reliable men upon whom you depended. How could you do this, when it is too apparent that they need to be born again before they can see the kingdom of God. They need the work of the truth upon the heart to make them men of opportunity.",
