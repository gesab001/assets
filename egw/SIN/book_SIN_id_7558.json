    "word": "Avoid Praising Men and Familiarity.--I am pained when I see men praised, flattered, and petted. God has revealed the fact that some who receive these attentions are unworthy to take His name into their lips; yet they are exalted to heaven in the estimation of finite man, who reads only from outward appearance. My sisters, never pet and flatter poor, failing, erring men, either young or old, married or unmarried. You know not their weaknesses, and you know not but these very attentions and this profuse praise \n                                                                           495\nmay prove their ruin. I am alarmed at the shortsightedness, the want of wisdom, that many manifest in respect to this familiarity. . . .",
