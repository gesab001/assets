    "word": "Medical Missionary Work\n     There was a time when in America the cause of God was in distressing need of help to work the new fields. The work struggled against difficulties and opposition of every type. Wherever it was received, the entrance of truth was a blessing. The truth elevated the debased, reformed the wrongdoer, educated the ignorant, comforted the mourner, restrained the tyranny of slavery, and liberated those that were bound. It introduced reforms in varied lines. The truth presented as it is in Jesus won a place in the world's confidence, and it should have gone forward, attaining victory after victory.",
