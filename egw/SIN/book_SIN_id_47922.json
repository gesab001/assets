    "word": "A young man and his wife have lately taken their stand with us. He was employed in a bakery, but lost his position when he began keeping the Sabbath. He has been entrusted with the sale of the Health Foods. We hope that he will be able to do good work in this line. He and his wife are both young and strong, and they will be able, we hope, to manage the health food business in Maitland successfully.",
