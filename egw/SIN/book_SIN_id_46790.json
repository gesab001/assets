    "word": "During my stay in Europe I spent freely my own means to advance the various interests of the cause. Since my return to America I have invested $1600 in various branches of the work, expecting that the sale of my books would supply the necessary means, but instead of this I have been obliged to borrow the money and to pay interest upon it. If I publish new books, I must have money to pay my helpers, who assist in preparing the matter for the press. Then there is the cost of type-setting, making plates, illustrations, etc., etc. All these things require money. Now \n                                                                           657\nwhat am I to do? Shall I dismiss my helpers? stop publishing?",
