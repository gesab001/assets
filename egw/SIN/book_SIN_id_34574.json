    "word": "Let every weak, tempest-tossed soul find anchorage in Jesus Christ and not become so self-centered that he can think only of his little disappointments and the interruption of his plans and hopes. Is not the subject of the plan of salvation all-absorbing? If the infinite God justifies me, \"who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died\" (verse 34). He has in His dying for man revealed how much He loves man--enough to die for Him! The law condemns the sinner and drives him to Christ. It is God that justifies and pardons.",
