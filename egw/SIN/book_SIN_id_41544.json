    "word": "MR No. 777 - Salvation Out of and Away From Ourselves\n\n     We are nearing the end of this earth's history. We have only a short time now in which to perfect Christian character. But those who love Jesus will love those who are the purchase of His blood. Far more patience must be exercised, more earnest efforts must be made to save the erring. Man cannot change his own heart or atone for his own sins. He cannot remove one spot or stain of sin from the character. Human merit cannot elevate the soul, and make men fit to meet the favor of God. Salvation is out of and away from ourselves. Salvation is by Jesus Christ, for He alone is our righteousness. Would that everyone would cease to look to himself for merit. We are to find in Jesus Christ all we need, and by cooperating with Him, we shall be complete in Him. \"Ye are complete in Him,\" not having your own righteousness, but having His merits, His righteousness.-Letter 33, 1894, pp. 3, 4. (To Lucinda Hall, August 23, 1894.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 3, 1980",
