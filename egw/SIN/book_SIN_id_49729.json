    "word": "I am instructed to seek for the sheep that are being destroyed by wolves. Let us not be over-sensitive regarding the representations of hatred made by others. Christ was mocked and insulted. Men for whom he was about to give his life, buffeted and smote him, saying, \"Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?\" Let us call to mind the scenes of Christ's suffering, and be prepared to suffer for his sake. And let no one of us give occasion for a brother to go over to the enemy's side. Let us make the kindest efforts to disabuse the minds of the tempted ones. Let it be our object to win souls to Christ, at the same time not compromising one point of truth. Let us stand on the affirmative, leaving others to do the accusing.",
