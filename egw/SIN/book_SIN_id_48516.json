    "word": "A Pioneer \n\n     I feel so thankful to the Lord that He never disappoints me; that He gives me strength and grace. As I stood by the side of my dying husband, I placed my hand in his, and said, \"Do you know me, husband?\" He nodded. Said I: \"All through the years I have allowed you to bear the business responsibilities, and to lead out in new enterprises. Now I promise you to be a pioneer myself.\" And I added, \"If you realize what I say, grasp my hand a little more firmly.\" He did so; he could not speak.",
