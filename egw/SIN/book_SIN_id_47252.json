    "word": "I received a most thorough, and hearty confession from Leroy Nicola. I know if he walked in the light that this must come. I knew that the Lord had shut me in with him at that Minneapolis meeting, and the spirit that he and many others possessed was plainly revealed to me. My heart is rejoiced that he has yielded to the influence of the Holy Spirit. It has taken four years of striving of the Spirit of God to bring him to this. I understand that Brother Morrison, Madison Miller, and others are coming into the light, where they may be a blessing to other souls.\" We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye witnesses of His majesty.\"",
