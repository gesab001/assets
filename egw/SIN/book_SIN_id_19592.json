    "word": "There is need of greater faith in our ranks. Our people in Washington and in Mountain View are not in the state spiritually that God requires of them, and they are not doing the work that is demanded for this time. Some realize in a measure the times in which we live, but only a few seem to be fully awake to the situation. There is a work outside of their regular daily business that should be done. The simplicity of true godliness is not maintained. There needs to be an expression of greater humility.--Lt 164, 1909.",
