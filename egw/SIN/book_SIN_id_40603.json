    "word": "Brother C. must not be deceived and think his labors more valuable than they really are. Brother C. must exercise judgment and economy in using means. Brethren work hard for their means and while they see so little accomplished in the field by Brother C. they are in trial. Brother C. must remember the brethren have cause for trial on account of his lack of judgment and use of means. He must be willing to be instructed by his brethren where he lacks judgment and not suffer jealousy to come into his heart against them who would labor for his interest. In love, Ellen G. White.--Letter 3, 1864, pp. 2-7. (To Brother Czechowski, circa 1864.) \n\n\n                                   -193-",
