    "word": "The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light. Jesus said this, and we see that the world works on a different plan in these matters. Weighty responsibilities connected with the business of the world are not placed wholly upon one man. In large business enterprises responsible men choose others to share their burdens and lift their responsibilities so that in case one should fail there is someone ready to step into his place. Someone should feel a burden over these matters, and a decided change should take place in the manner of our work.-- Letter 12, 1885, pp. 3-5. (To G. I. Butler and S. N. Haskell, October 28, 1885.)",
