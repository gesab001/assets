    "word": "MR No. 345 - Ellen G. White Statements About Her Work\n\n     I praise the Lord that it is my privilege to have editing my writings those who love God and seem as fully interested in the preparation of the articles as myself. They are all conscientious workers. My son, W. C. White, is a very necessary help to take this business and work it out. Miss Marian Davis has been with me twenty-five years and is an efficient worker. From the articles already published over a period of years she selects and brings together the matter for bookmaking.--Manuscript 171, 1903. (Diary, January 3 to 31, 1903.)",
