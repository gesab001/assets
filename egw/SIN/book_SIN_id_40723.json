    "word": "I rejoiced when I heard that the Battle Creek school was to be established in a farming district. I know that there will be less temptation there for the students than there would be in the cities that are fast becoming as Sodom and Gomorrah, preparing for destruction by fire. The popular sentiment is that cities should be chosen as locations for our schools. But God desires us to leave the sin-polluted atmosphere of the cities. It is His design that our schools shall be established where the atmosphere is purer.--Ms 67, 1901, p. 9. (\"The Church School,\" typed July 29, 1901.)",
