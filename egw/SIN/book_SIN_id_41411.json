    "word": "E. G. White's Letter a Message From God.--You ask if the Lord gave me that letter to give to you. I say, He did, The Holy God of Israel will not serve with your sins. That message was given of God. If you have had, since that message was given, a new sense of what constitutes sin, if you have become truly converted, a child of God in place of being a transgressor of His law, then there is no one who will be more pleased than myself.-- Letter 95, 1893, p. 1. (July 20, 1893.)",
