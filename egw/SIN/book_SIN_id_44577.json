    "word": "Your father is appearing some better. We have killed one wild black squirrel per day. He enjoys it much. We have all the fruit we could desire. I take him somewhere every day, rain or shine. Yesterday I muffled him up in shawls and buffalo and took him to Olcott village, three miles, while the rain was pouring down and running off his hat in a stream. We went to Justus Lampson's. Took dinner, accompanied by Sister Lindsey and Mary. We went in one chaise, they in another. The front and sides are all open and the rain was directly in our faces. Your father did not get tired; enjoyed the visit, and we returned, again in the rain, in the afternoon, Today we take dinner at Harmon's. Shall have him ride to Olcott, although it is cloudy and stormy. It has rained every day since we have been here, yet your father has been out, I believe, somewhere every day.",
