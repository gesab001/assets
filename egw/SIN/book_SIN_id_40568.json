    "word": "We purchased half a box of the lemon oranges at four cents per dozen. I call them superior; and then we returned home without our two cases of oranges. The oranges are excellent here, and are about eighty cents per bushel in American money. In Parramatta in the markets on Tuesdays and Fridays, the fruit growers sell their fruit at auction sale. We purchased oranges at nine pence a bushel last market day; that is about eighteen cents in American money; but the fruit is not first class. The cheapness of all the products of farms and orchards will explain why there is so much poverty in this country. Farmers do not receive enough for their produce to pay their expenses in raising it. Cauliflower is bought for a mere song. We have purchased large bags full for eight and ten cents. We purchase a large amount, and feed it to the cow and horses. . . .",
