    "word": "Here the inspired apostle has given us the only safe course to follow in our life-experience if we would develop the attributes of a true Christian. There is to be no uncertainty in these matters. The Lord would have everyone that receives Him by faith perfect a Christian character during probationary time. The work of the Spirit of God in a man is not a work that unfits him for the common duties of ordinary life. There is not to be one religion for business and another religion for the church. The work of the Spirit of God embraces the whole man, soul, body, and spirit.",
