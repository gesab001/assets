    "word": "If we serve sin we shall meet the reward of the transgressor of the law of Jehovah, before the judgment seat of Christ. The Lord Jesus is to judge the world. He can read the purpose of every life, see through every soul, discern the thought of every heart, estimate the feelings that prompt to every action. All the invitations of a gracious God--given, but slighted and refused and rejected--will be presented to every individual, and the sentence which will fix the destiny of the soul in eternal bliss or to be punished with the fiery element of the wrath of God will close the history of the wicked forever.",
