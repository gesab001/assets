    "word": "Hunt Up No Grievances.--To judge our brethren, to allow feelings to be cherished against them, even if we feel they have not done exactly right toward us, will bring no blessing to our hearts and will not help the case at all. I dare not allow my feelings to run in the channel of hunting up all my grievances, telling them over and over, and dwelling in the atmosphere of distrust, enmity, and dissension.--Lt 74, 1888. (HC 239.)",
