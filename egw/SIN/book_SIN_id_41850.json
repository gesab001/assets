    "word": "Between Chicago and Richland, Kansas, October 25, 1878--On the cars. Rested well last night. We had our window open and gave our lungs food. The cars were very hot, and no ventilation was allowed from the ventilator above. This morning there is a great complaint of faintness and languor when no effort is made to give us fresh air. There are thirty who have passed the night in a closed car. Emanations from the bodies and exhalations from the lungs have poisoned the air, yet no windows except mine have been raised to let in the rich blessing heaven has provided in fresh, pure air. Must the health and life of travelers be imperiled by being left to \n\n\n                                  -58- \n\nthe control of ignorant porters and one or two sick passengers? We will have air from outside. We will not endanger health and life because of the ignorance of porters.",
