    "word": "Keep your school up in all its elevated character; for much is involved in this. Consequences will follow hasty action, which will spoil the plan of God's devising. Cannot we trust the Lord, and wait prayerfully for Him to indicate duty at every step now, which means so much to the church in Battle Creek? Everything is to be carefully studied and prayerfully considered from cause to effect. There are issues that will--hasty moves that will--be regretted. We must not follow human wisdom now. We must look to God in the humble contrition of soul that we can be taught and led of God.",
