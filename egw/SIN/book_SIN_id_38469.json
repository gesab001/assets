    "word": "Burrough Valley, Cal., Aug. 1, 1888. \n     Dear Brother: Several have said to me that Brother and Sister Daniels were in the habit of using tea, and when they were spoken to in regard to it they had stated that Sister White kept tea in her house, drank it herself, and advised you to drink it. It is difficult for me to believe that you have said this, although the same testimony has come from several.",
