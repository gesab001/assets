    "word": "Victories are not gained by ceremonies or display but by simple obedience to the highest General, the Lord God of heaven. He who trusts in this Leader will never know defeat.

Man may stand conqueror of himself, conqueror of his own inclinations, conqueror of principalities and powers, and of the \"rulers of the darkness of this world,\" and of \"spiritual wickedness in high places.\" . . .",
