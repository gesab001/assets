    "word": "There was a fault with the church at Battle Creek in not appreciating the moral worth of Bro. Bell, and his superior method of teaching, which made it necessary for me to relate that which had been shown me in reference to his ability as a teacher. His thorough manner of instruction was not in accordance with the superficial method of educating children in the common schools. The thorough drilling to which his pupils were subjected was objectionable to many, and his strict discipline, and his complete system of instruction, were very disagreeable to a class of children who had been in the habit of confining themselves to the very letter of instruction as found in books, and of sliding through these books with rapidity, thinking they were far in advance of what they really were. These children, who had been petted and indulged at home and pushed forward at school, were highly dissatisfied that the same plan was not carried forward by Bro. Bell. They complained at home, and their parents \n                                                                           3\nsympathized with them when their sympathy should have been wholly with the faithful instructor of their children. They should have felt that it was a great blessing to have a teacher who would look after the physical, moral, and spiritual interest of their children, as well as to instruct them in the sciences.",
