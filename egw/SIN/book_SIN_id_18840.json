    "word": "SEEMINGLY UNANSWERED PRAYERS MAY BE AMONG OUR GREATEST BLESSINGS.\u2014In His loving care and interest for us, often He who understands us better than we understand ourselves refuses to permit us selfishly to seek the gratification of our own ambition. He does not permit us to pass by the homely but sacred duties that lie next us. Often these duties afford the very training essential to prepare us for a higher work. Often our plans fail that God\u2019s plans for us may succeed.",
