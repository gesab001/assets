    "word": "Religion can bless only where it influences. If we at any time exclude its influence, we exclude its blessing. I almost see you a boy again, and want to say, John, my son, for Christ's sake put on the whole armor of righteousness; open the windows of the mind, the door of the heart, and let heaven's blessed sunshine flood both mind and soul temple; then joy in Christ will be a permanent state of the heart. \"These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.\" I have seen you, in reviewing the past, full of keen remorse and inexpressible sorrow. Have you confessed all \n\n\n                                     -96- \n\nto God? Have you asked Him to pardon your transgressions? I know you have, and do you believe that He will pardon your transgressions? Then act on the promise. You have the pledged word of God. You may be free in Christ Jesus, and He will remember your sins no more. How many times I have longed to say to you, Look! Oh, look and live! I know just what I am writing about.",
