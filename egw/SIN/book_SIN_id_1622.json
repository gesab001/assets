    "word": "The work and mission of Christ in this world was not to gratify the idle curiosity of princes, rulers, scribes, priests, or peasants. He came to heal the brokenhearted. . . .

But the precious gems of truth, He had instructed His disciples, were not to be cast before swine. And Christ\u2019s deportment and silence before Herod made His silence eloquent.",
