    "word": "I have carried these matters upon my soul until they seem to be eating away my courage and life. Now I can refrain no longer. I have spoken. Had I known of one who would have stood by Elder Olsen and given him that wisdom in counsel and that help he so much needs, I would have sent this letter long ago; but after writing it, I have drawn back from sending it. It has been a mystery to me how Elder Olsen could receive and sanction two men of similar religious character, when he has no evidence that they are consecrated to God. They have manifested little of a vital connection with God, and yet he has linked them together and sent them upon distant and important missions, to do important work demanding clear and sanctified agents who could look to \n                                                                           1288\nheaven and say, \"Speak, Lord; for Thy servant heareth.\" Elder Olsen's proposition to have A. R. Henry come to this country I could not sanction. I was compelled to say that we did not want him. God had presented his case before me. Since the Minneapolis meeting he has never taken his position in full reception of the light God has so graciously given for these last days. He has not honored the position he has occupied in the Office, because he has carried the spirit of A. R. Henry in full size. In him there has been no diminution of self. God has revealed to me that the influence given to these men whose hearts are not right with God, who are not in harmony with God, will prove in the end a curse instead of a blessing. The confidence of the people cannot sustain these men if they pursue their course of action.",
