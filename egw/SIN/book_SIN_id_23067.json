Under the influence of the Holy Spirit, Paul uttered a prophetic denunciation similar to that which Christ had uttered in rebuking the hypocrisy of the Jews. The judgment pronounced by the apostle was terribly fulfilled when the iniquitous and hypocritical high priest was murdered by assassins in the Jewish war. But the bystanders regarded the words of Paul as profane, and exclaimed with horror, \"Revilest thou God's high priest?\" Paul answered, with his usual courtesy, \"I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.\"",
