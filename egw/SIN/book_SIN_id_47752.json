    "word": "There are dangers presented to me and serious wrongs existing in the Review and Herald office at Battle Creek. There are men blindfolded, as it were, handling sacred responsibilities; and if the light now being given of God is not accepted and believed and acted upon during this coming conference, men's wisdom and specious devising will be presented and accepted in your councils as the wisdom of God, when it is the counsel originated by Satan and put into the minds of men. Men will go on in their own unsanctified, unholy spirit, and, as they advance, become more self-confident, more satisfied with their unsanctified selves. They are not led by the Lord, and men's wisdom is to them like a higher form and source of good, as Satan presented to Adam and Eve. But it is the deceiving power of the enemy. The mystery of iniquity will work, clothed in angel's robes.",
