It would take stronger minds, with greater decision of character than you three possess, to be brought into the society you are, and not be affected. Listen to the words of Christ: \"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.\" Have your example and influence been of that positive character that has impressed and convicted your associates? I think not. You have been injured. Darkness has settled upon you, and dimmed your light; and your light has not burned with that luster to dispel the darkness about others. You have been separating farther and farther from God. You, my brother, have but a faint sense of what you have been doing.",
