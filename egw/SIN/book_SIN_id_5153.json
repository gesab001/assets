    "word": "Faith Rare Among the Wealthy \n\n     A consistent faith is rare among rich men. Genuine faith, sustained by works, is rare. But all who possess this faith will be men who will not lack influence. They will copy after Christ in that disinterested benevolence and interest in the work of saving souls that He had. The followers of Christ should value souls \n                                                                           153\nas He valued them.

What are money, houses, and lands, in comparison with even one soul?--R. & H., Feb. 23, 1886.",
