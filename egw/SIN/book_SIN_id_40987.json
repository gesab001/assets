    "word": "One worker may be a ready speaker, another a ready writer, another may have the gift of sincere, earnest, fervent prayer, another the gift of singing. Another may have special power to explain the word of God with clearness. And each gift is to become a power for God because He works with the laborer. To one God gives the word of wisdom, to another knowledge, to another faith. But all are to work under the same Head. The diversity of gifts leads to a diversity of operations, \"but it is the same God which worketh all in all.\"--Letter 1, 1902, p. 2. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, January 18, 1902.)",
