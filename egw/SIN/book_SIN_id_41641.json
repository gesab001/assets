    "word": "I have learned to trust in God and not to expect anyone but Him to understand the work He has given me to do. Others, with the knowledge of the way God has led me, may be unappreciative and unsympathetic. They may have no more idea of the work given me than a child. I have had experience after experience with my supposed-to-be unchangeable friends, whom I have found to be as trustworthy as a reed shaken by the wind, unable to read and understand my life struggle. They have given themselves up to evil surmisings, to watching for evil, to duplicity and falsehood. I have met with this ignorance of spiritual things until I have learned to say with Paul, \"None of these things move me\" (Acts 20:24). They may say, \"She hath a devil,\" or \"She doeth these things by the power of the devil.\" They may say anything their hearts lead them to say. I know myself of the hardships, the disappointments, the anguish of spirit, that I have been compelled to know, when I have realized that I am alone. I stand in God, with heart and mind open to the Heaven-revealed truth. I stand against men of low degree and against \n\n\n                                -169- \n\nmen of high degree, conscious that the truth revealed to me nearly fifty-three years ago was from God. No human being has been able to wrest it from me. At times I have had to face nearly the whole church in defense and vindication of the Heaven-sent light. Yet God has upheld me, and these many years an unchangeable testimony has been borne. Looking over more than half a century of experience, I can say with confidence, \"O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared Thy wondrous works, and will declare them\" (See Psalm 71:17). The puny arm of man has been powerless to hinder.",
