    "word": "I spoke to the few assembled in regard to the rise and progress of the messages, and my experience and connection with the work in 1843 and 1844 and since that time. This was not a pleasant task for me, but I knew the people had no real knowledge of my work and this is what they needed. There was no one present who had had an experience in these messages, and I must speak for myself and for the work in which I have been called to act a part.--Ms. 49, 1890, pp. 4-5 (Diary 16, pp. 358-359).",
