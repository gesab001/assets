    "word": "W. C. White: May I tell the brethren of the things you said to me at New Castle, N. S. W., about the reform that we as a people must stand for in the matter of high charges? There are many others things you have said we should stand for, like men nursing men, and women nursing women; and some of these matters have been written out and printed. But I am not sure that this that you told me at that time has ever been written out, and I should like to repeat it to these brethren in your presence, so that you can testify as to whether I have told it correctly or not.",
