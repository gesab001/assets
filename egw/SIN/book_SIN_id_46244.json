    "word": "To the church in Battle Creek I would say, There is a work to be done among you before you can be ready for the Lord's appearing. Do not exalt yourselves and disparage others as you have done in the past. Let every soul confess and forsake his own sins. We are living in the great day of atonement. Make diligent work for repentance. Your souls are in peril, but by confession and repentance you can be cleansed from sin.",
