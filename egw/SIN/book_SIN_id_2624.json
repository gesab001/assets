    "word": "In New York City, in Chicago, and in other great centers of population, there is a larger foreign element--multitudes of various nationalities, and all practically unwarned. Among Seventh-day Adventists there is a great zeal--and I am not saying there is any too much--to work in foreign countries; but it would be pleasing to God if a proportionate zeal were manifested to work the cities close by. His people need to move sensibly. They need to set about this work in the cities with serious earnestness. Men of consecration and talent are to be sent into these cities and set to work. Many classes of laborers are to unite in conducting these efforts to warn the people.--Review and Herald, July 25, 1918. \n                                                                           200",
