    "word": "Here we are in a world that is unfavorable to right and truth. What shall we do? We must put our whole business into the business of serving God. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\" (Matthew 6:33). You have a God who says, \"If \n\n\n                                    -245- \n\nye keep my commandments I will bless you in your fields, and flocks, and herds, and vineyards, and all that you put your hand unto.\" The God of heaven has placed a benediction upon them that keep the commandments of God. Shall we stand as a peculiar people of God, or shall we trample upon the law of God and say it is not binding? God might just as well have abolished Himself. In the law every specification is the character of the infinite God.",
