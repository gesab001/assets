    "word": "The Lord Jehovah's Presence in Every Office.--The Lord Jehovah's presence is to be recognized in every room of the office, as His voice was recognized by Adam and Eve in \n\n60 \n\nthe Garden of Eden. The Lord comes to His own place in the Review and Herald office, [BY THE \"OFFICE\" WAS MEANT THE REVIEW AND HERALD PUBLISHING HOUSE AND/OR THE CHURCH HEADQUARTERS, WHICH WAS HOUSED AT THAT TIME IN THE WEST BUILDING OF THE PRINTING PLANT IN BATTLE CREEK.] from whence should go forth the blessings of the light from His presence, imbuing with His Spirit every worker who is doing His service, that not a trace of Satan's attributes shall be revealed in the look of the eye, the hearing of the ear, the words spoken or the attitude taken.",
