    "word": "Bro. Salisbury has had a genuine interest in the Health Institute. He has neglected his own interest in his mercantile business to give his time for the benefit of the Institute. This has been at a loss on his part, \n                                                                           47\nwhich he should not be permitted to sustain. The Health Institute is able to remunerate him for his services. He should not while engaged in his mercantile business be depended on or called upon by the Institute. He has enough upon his hands without having an increase of care and responsibility. He should be released from responsibilities in connection with the Institute. While he has so large a business, he cannot with success manage the business at the Institute. Bro. S. has not all that discernment and foresight that is required in management at the Institute. With his mercantile business pressing him, he is in danger of doing things that might be left undone, and neglecting to do things at the right time, which greatly need to be done.",
