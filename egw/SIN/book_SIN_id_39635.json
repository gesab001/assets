    "word": "These are especially festive days with the Catholics. We hear them all times of night calling upon their dead friends to come and visit them. They believe that the dead come from their graves and communicate with them and they declare that they see them and talk with them, and all through the night there is carousing and singing and loud voices going through the streets, calling upon the dead to appear. Oh, what ignorance and heathen superstition! I saw the most extravagant display of wreaths, beautiful bouquets, and flowers arranged in the form of a cross. These were taken to the graveyards and in honor of the dead placed upon their graves. I learn \n\n\n                                   -64- \n\nthat they believe the dead respond and reveal themselves. This is Spiritualism.",
