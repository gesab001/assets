    "word": "While we are to stand firm as a rock to principle, we should be courteous and Christlike in our dealings with all men. We should tell people plainly that we cannot accept the papal sabbath, because it is a mark of special dishonor to God, whom we love and worship. But while we sacredly observe the Sabbath of the Lord, it is not our work to compel others to observe it. God never forces the conscience; that is Satan's work. Since God is the author of the Sabbath, it must be presented to the minds of men in contrast to the false sabbath, that all may choose between them. It is Satan who tries to compel the conscience that error may be accepted and honored.",
