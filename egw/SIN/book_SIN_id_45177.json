    "word": "Now, we should be very grateful for the help of Elder Waggoner in England and in Switzerland, but what can we decide upon? We must have evidence that he is clear before God. We do not want to make a light matter of sin, and say to the sinner, \"It shall be well with thee.\" We do not want to connect Elder Waggoner \n\n\n                                     -379- \n\nwith the work here unless he has a connection with God. We do not want to have the drawback that would come by connecting a man with the work who has a blot on his garments. We cannot pass lightly over this matter.",
