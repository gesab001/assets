    "word": "No soul is ever finally deserted of God, given up to his own ways, so long as there is any hope of his salvation. \"Man turns from God, not God from him.\" Our heavenly Father follows us with appeals and warnings and assurances of compassion, until further opportunities and privileges would be wholly in vain. The responsibility rests with the sinner. By resisting the Spirit of God today, he prepares the way for a second resistance of light when it comes with mightier power. Thus he passes on from one stage of resistance to another, until at last the light will fail to impress, and he will cease to respond in any measure to the Spirit of God. Then even \"the light that is in thee\" has become darkness. The very truth we do know has become so perverted as to increase the blindness of the soul.",
