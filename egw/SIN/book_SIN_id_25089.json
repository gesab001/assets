    "word": "11. THIS EXPOSITION OF THE PROPHECY IS CONFIRMED BY THE MESSAGE FROM THE LORD FOUND IN REVELATION 14:9-12, WHICH IS BASED ALTOGETHER ON THE FACTS OF REVELATION 13:11-17, AND WHICH CONDEMNS IN THE VERY STRONGEST TERMS THE ACTION OF THIS BEAST AND THE WORSHIP WHICH IT ENFORCES; IT ALSO CALLS TO KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD AND THE FAITH OF JESUS, AND ONE OF THESE COMMANDMENTS ENFORCES THE SABBATH OF THE LORD,--THE SEVENTH DAY. THEREFORE THE CONTRAST IN THE FACTS AND IN THE MESSAGE WHICH REFERS TO THE FACTS, IS BETWEEN THE SABBATH OF THE LORD AND AN OPPOSING SABBATH, NAMELY, THE SUNDAY.",
