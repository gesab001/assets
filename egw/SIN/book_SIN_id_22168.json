    "word": "To the end of time, men will arise to create confusion and rebellion among the people who profess to obey the law of God.

Those who prophesy lies, encourage men to look upon sin as a light thing. When the terrible results of their evil deeds are made manifest, they seek, if possible, to make the one who has faithfully warned them responsible for their difficulties, even as the Jews charged Jeremiah with their evil fortunes.",
