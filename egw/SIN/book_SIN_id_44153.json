    "word": "June 5. Dear Son Edson: I have received your letter, also letters from Brethren Daniells, Kilgore, and Sharp. It hurts me to think that you are using words which I wrote prior to the conference. Since the conference great changes have been made. Do not urge that Mother has said thus and so. I know \n\n\n                                   -148- \n\nthat reforms are to be made; but when I am not present to hear the words that are spoken, I cannot advise you to select a few words from a letter I have written and use these words to forbid a course which the brethren wish to pursue regarding the publication and handling of books. Changes have been made, and I trust that our brethren who are interested in the book work will manifest an unselfish interest in the disposal of books for the Southern field.",
