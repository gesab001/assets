    "word": "I do not now expect to attend the General Conference. I should not dare to go, for I am very much worn with the responsibilities that I have been carrying since the Fresno camp meeting. It is like this: When I stand before congregations of our people, I feel very intensely, because I understand the peril of those who as blind men have followed their own counsel. Were I to go to the Conference, I should be compelled to take positions that would cut some to the quick. It greatly hurts me to do this, and it is a long time before I recover from the strain that such an experience brings on me. When the Lord bids me speak, I am obliged to lay aside my own inclinations, and bear the testimony that He sends, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear, whether they are pleased or displeased. \n\n\n                                 -122-",
