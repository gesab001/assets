    "word": "The richest treasures, the highest blessings of this life, are meager and unsatisfying when compared with those of the future, immortal life. There will open to the senses scenes of beauty that no language can portray. \u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\u201d And these precious treasures are freely offered to all who will accept them. \u201cBlessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\u201d",
