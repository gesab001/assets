    "word": "It becomes all who expect to see Jesus as He is, and to be made like Him, so to follow Him daily that their character may be molded after His image. When our hearts reflect His likeness we shall not judge unrighteously; we shall honor those whom God honors, and we shall be very circumspect in spirit, in word, in action, lest we grieve one of God's little ones. He who loves God because his own sins have been forgiven will manifest a forgiving spirit toward others.",
