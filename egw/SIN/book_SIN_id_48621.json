    "word": "Righteousness and Love of Christ \n\n     Laborers in the cause of truth should present the righteousness of Christ, not as new light, but as precious light that has for a time been lost sight of by the people. We are to accept of Christ as our personal Saviour, and He imputes unto us the righteousness of God in Christ. Let us repeat and make prominent the truth that John has portrayed, \"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\" 1 John 4:10.",
