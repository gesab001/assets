    "word": "We know that Paul had presented before him the state of the churches. God has given him light and knowledge in regard to the order that should be maintained in the churches, the evils that would arise, and which would have to be corrected and firmly dealt with corresponding to their aggravated character. The Lord had revealed to Paul the purity, the devotion and piety that should be maintained in the church, and things arising contrary to this he knew must be reproved according to the light given him of God.",
