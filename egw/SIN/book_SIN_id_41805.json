    "word": "No More Clatter and Misery--You cannot tell how I long for retirement. The noise of carriages on the stone pavements, the clatter of wooden shoes, the people coming and going constantly on foot, the baby carriages, the women, men, and boys wheeling their hand carts, screeching out their merchantable goods, is so confusing. You scarcely know where you are. Surely all this will have an end. Jesus is coming. I long to hear the trumpet sound and the dead come forth from the graves.--Letter 101, 1886, p. 3. (To Addie Walling, Ellen White's great-niece, from Copenhagen, Denmark, July 25, 1886.)",
