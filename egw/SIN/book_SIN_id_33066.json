    "word": "It was not because this woman was a Samaritan that she did not know Christ, for He came to save the Samaritans as well as the Jews. With Him there is no cast or special favored people. He came to take away the sins of the world. This He is willing to do for all, Jew or Gentile, and this we must have done for us before we can enter heaven. We must let Him take away our sins because in Him was no sin. He is our sin-bearer.--Manuscript 18, Oct. 19, 1895.",
