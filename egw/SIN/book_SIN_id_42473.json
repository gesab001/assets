    "word": "Rest your soul on the Lord. Be assured that Jesus has a care for you and for your family. He knows the end from the beginning. He thought of us before we thought of Him. His heart is stirred with divine compassion for all who need His words of encouragement and hope. His love for us was fully manifested in the sacrifice that He made to redeem us. He gave His life as a ransom for sinners. He so loved the lost race that He died for them. \n\n\n                                  -128- \n\nThose who are walking in His footsteps will, by tender compassion and unselfish interest, provoke one another to love and to good works.",
