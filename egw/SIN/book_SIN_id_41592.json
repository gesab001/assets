    "word": "Now you may regard it as a matter of economy. It may bring in some means to invest in the work. I was carried right back to Saul, and was there shown how he ordered that the best of the cattle and sheep should be kept to offer to the Lord as a burnt sacrifice notwithstanding the Lord had told them that everything should be destroyed. And the Lord said Saul should lose his soul for that very act. And yet Saul in his eagerness declared that he had kept the law. Why, said he, \"I have kept the command, but have kept some of the best of the cattle, oxen, and sheep to offer to the Lord for a burnt sacrifice.\" Then said Samuel to him, \"To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\" And here the means that is brought in by any of you by transgression of God's law, God will just as surely scatter that means as you have it. For a time it may seem that God wants this means, but God bears with men to a certain point, but when sufficient light has been given and they do not regard that light, then His hand is stretched out to destroy them. And if any of you are engaged in business with men where there is any infringement on God's law you [had] better cut loose from all such things. The Lord bears and forbears long with the perversity of His children, but when He undertakes to punish them He will not cease until He has made a full end.",
