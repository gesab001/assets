    "word": "Why not keep steadily at work in the lines that God has given us? Why not walk in the clear light He has revealed, and in place of tearing to pieces that which God has built up, work on the side of Jesus Christ? Oh, how Satan would rejoice to get in among this people, and disorganize the work at a time when thorough organization is essential and will be the greatest power to keep out spurious uprisings and to refute claims not endorsed by the Word of God.--Letter 37, 1894, pp. 5-7. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. January 3, 1985",
