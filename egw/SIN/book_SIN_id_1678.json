    "word": "This conflict was opened upon the Son of God. He was afflicted; He was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. The Majesty of heaven had to leave the scene of His labor again and again because of Satan\u2019s bruising His heel, and finally Satan\u2019s malignity reached its utmost power when Satan inspired and controlled the minds of wicked men to crucify Him. He has followed the children of God, causing them disaster and death. . . . Isaiah, Daniel, and John have in prophecy announced these very struggles and conquests that God\u2019s people would pass through, and the triumph of Satan in his supposed victories.",
