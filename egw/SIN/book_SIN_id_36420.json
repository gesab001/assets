    "word": "The heart of God is moved. Souls are very precious in his sight. It was for this world that Christ wept in agony, for this world he was crucified. God gave his only begotten Son to save sinners, and he desires us to love others as he has loved us. He desires to see those who have had great light flashing that light upon the pathway of their fellow-men.",
