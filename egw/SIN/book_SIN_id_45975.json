White, to the Pacific Union Medical Missionary Council, Sanitarium Chapel, St. Helena, California, June 19, 1902.] \n\n\n    Conformity to the world is causing many of our people to lose their bearings. I feel deeply over this matter, because it is continually kept before me by the Lord. For many years it has been presented to me again and again that a worldly policy has been coming into the management of many of our institutions. And when I read the published Testimonies that were given in the early seventies and even before that time, I am surprised to see how clearly our dangers in this matter have been pointed out, and how plainly the right way has been outlined from the beginning.",
