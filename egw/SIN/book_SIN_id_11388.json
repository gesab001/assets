    "word": "There are not many ways to heaven. Each one may not choose his own way. Christ says, \u201cI am the way: . . . no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.\u201d Since the first gospel sermon was preached, when in Eden it was declared that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent\u2019s head, Christ had been uplifted as the way, the truth, and the life. He was the way when Adam lived, when Abel presented to God the blood of the slain lamb, representing the blood of the Redeemer. Christ was the way by which patriarchs and prophets were saved. He is the way by which alone we can have access to God.\u2014DA 663.",
