    "word": "Wise counsel and righteous practices are needed now, if the people of God [are to] succeed in preserving clear minds and healthy bodies. We must give close attention to eating, drinking, and dressing. The entire body of believers needs to make a decided reform. A high profession, followed by a disregard of the laws of life, shows a faithless life. Lack of fidelity, want to stability, slavery to wrong habits,--this is the sure result of such a course. Those who follow this course are not consistent Christians. Salvation means deliverance from every habit which tends to drag humanity down. Transgression of the laws of our being is transgression of the laws of God.-- Letter 83, 1901, pp. 2, 3. (To \"Dear Brethren and Sisters,\" July 15, 1901.) \n\nReleased May 20, 1977.",
