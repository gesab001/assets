W., \n                      Australia, Dec. 16, 1898. \n     Let great care be exercised. The work of our schools, Sanitarium, and publishing houses should be so arranged that men who are selfish and covetous, who move under Satan's generalship, can not take advantage of circumstances to make all the trouble possible. In the past Satan has used men acting a part in the work of God. As any time he chose he has played his human instrument, causing notes of discord to be heard, to bring confusion and perplexity into the cause of God. Too much power has been given to unworthy men.",
