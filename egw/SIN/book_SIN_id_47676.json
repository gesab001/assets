    "word": "Truth, Bible truth, this is what the people need. They need none of the inferior tests which have been manufactured by men and attached to the truth as a part of it. These tests weaken those who believe them. We have a work to do of no inferior order. On our knees we are to claim the promises of God's word, asking that we may receive pure, unadulterated truth, and that we may see the necessity of practicing this truth and living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. Then men and women will be converted to the truth. The hand of God will be recognized in the raising up of new churches, baptizing with the apostolic spirit many who will go forth to do missionary work in places where the people know not the truth. These will need to be taught to gain an experience free from human sophistry.",
