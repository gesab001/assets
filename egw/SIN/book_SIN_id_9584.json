    "word": "Small Congregations\n     Do not become discouraged or slacken your efforts when there are only a few to listen to a discourse. Even if there are but two or three, or no more than one, how do you know but that there may be one soul with whom the Spirit of God is striving? The Lord may give you a message for that soul, and he, if converted, may be the means of reaching many others. The results of your labor may, all unknown to you, be multiplied a thousand-fold. Do not look at the empty seats, and let your faith and courage sink, but think of what God is doing, in bringing his truth before the world. Remember that you are co-operating with divine agencies,\u2014agencies that can never fail. Speak with as much earnestness, faith, and interest, as if there were thousands present to listen to your words.",
