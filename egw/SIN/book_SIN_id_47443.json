    "word": "Bro. Olsen, you told me you read to the Board that which I wrote in reference to your sitting and listening to resolutions that meant oppression to others, which you said not a word in remonstrance, \n                                                                           1404\nthus making yourself accountable for them, sanctioning them by your silence. How can you feel that you are doing God's service in sending unconsecrated men long journeys to do business in connection with the cause, thus virtually saying, \"This is my reliable force, men I can trust, whose integrity is firm: they are just the same in principles as myself.\" These men only advance the more boldly, as there are none who dare to say, \"Why do ye so?\" What reason have you for putting so much dependence on A.R. Henry, Leroy Nicola, and others I might name, who in a crisis will be on the wrong side? What reason have you to think that the Lord is imparting divine wisdom to men who have revealed that they have no spiritual connection with him.",
