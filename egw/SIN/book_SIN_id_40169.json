    "word": "We need not utter the mournful lamentation, \"The Lord has forsaken me, and my God hath forgotten me.\" For Jesus never forsakes a soul that desires Him. Men separate themselves from Him by their sins and transgressions; but Jesus draws the souls of men that they may behold Him and fall in love with Him. In Christ is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Jesus never asks us to bear more burdens than we have strength to bear. Let us not gather so many burdens upon ourselves that we shall be crushed under them. Let us lay the heavy burdens on One who can carry them.",
