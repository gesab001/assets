    "word": "How pleased is the Lord to see you--His little flock--truthful, upright, honest in all things! How pleased is your Father in heaven to listen to the fervent prayer, rising from each heart: \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\" Is there any precept of Thy Word slighted, any command that I disobey? Am I inclined to be untruthful in little things? Am I seeking to form right habits? Is the spirit I cherish in accordance with the mind and will of my pattern-- Jesus Christ? Is there any secret excuse I am making for my neglect of duty, for my disobedience? . . .",
