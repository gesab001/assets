    "word": "An Example. \n\n     In the case of Philip and Nathanael we have an example of true home missionary work. Philip had seen Jesus, and was convinced that He was the Messiah. The knowledge he had received was so blessed to him that he wished his friends, also, to know the good news. He was desirous that the light and truth which had brought him such comfort and joy should be shared by Nathanael. True grace in the heart will always reveal its existence by diffusing itself. Philip went in search of Nathanael, and as he called, Nathanael answered from his place of prayer under the fig tree. Nathanael had not had the privilege of listening to the words of Jesus, but he was being drawn toward Him in spirit. He longed for light and truth, and was at the moment sincerely praying for them. Philip with joy exclaimed, \"We have found Him, of \n                                                                           18\nwhom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth.\" This is the way light is to be communicated,--by private, personal effort. In the home circle, at your neighbor's fireside, at the bedside of the sick, in a quiet way you may read the Scriptures, and speak a word for Jesus and the truth. Precious seed may thus be sown, that will spring up and bring forth fruit after many days.",
