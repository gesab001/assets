THIS SCHOOL HAS BEEN IN OPERATION SINCE THE SPRING OF 1894, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THOSE IN CHARGE HAVE BEEN GREATLY HANDICAPPED IN THEIR EFFORTS BY THE LACK OF PROPER BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES, YET THERE HAVE BEEN SENT OUT FROM THE SCHOOL SEVERAL YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE DOING VERY ACCEPTABLE WORK. THREE OF THIS NUMBER HAVE BEEN ORDAINED TO THE MINISTRY. THE LACK OF THE NECESSARY BUILDINGS FOR THE PROPER CARE AND COMFORT OF THE STUDENTS, HOUSING OF STOCK, AND THE HANDLING AND STORAGE OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE FARM HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS DRAWBACK TO THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE SCHOOL AND FARM.",
