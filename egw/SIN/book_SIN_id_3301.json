    "word": "How many retiring from a position of responsibility as a judge, can say in regard to their purity, Which of you convinceth me of sin? Who can prove that I have turned aside from my righteousness to accept bribes? I have never stained my record as a man who does judgment and justice. Who today can say what Samuel said when he was taking leave of the people of Israel, because they were determined to have a king? . . . Brave, noble judge! But it is a sorrowful thing that a man of the strictest integrity should have to humble himself to make his own defence.",
