Those who eat of the forbidden tree accept Satan\u2019s fallacies in the place of \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d and unless they repent, they will never gain that life which measures with the life of God. As did Adam and Eve, they exclude themselves from the tree of life, the fruit of which perpetuates immortality. . . .",
