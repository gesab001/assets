    "word": "Unless the truth is stamped upon the soul, it will not be obeyed in the life. Unless every word of profession is heartfelt, it will be but empty sound. Through neglecting to practice the truth, it loses its power over the mind and conscience, and through love of sin, the Word loses its light, and certain ruin follows. He who does not practice the truth he knows, loses the love and Spirit of God.--Letter 13, 1893, pp. 20,21. (\"General Matter Bearing on the Case of a Young Man.\" No date.)",
