    "word": "To Reveal Especially Tender Love.--[John 13:34, 35 quoted.] Why should this commandment be new to the disciples? The words, \"As I have loved you\" were yet to be fulfilled by the offering He was about to make for the sins of the world. As Christ had loved them, the disciples were to love one another. They were to show forth the love abiding in their hearts for men, women, and children, by doing all in their power for their salvation. But they were to reveal a specially tender love for all of the same faith (MS 160, 1898).",
