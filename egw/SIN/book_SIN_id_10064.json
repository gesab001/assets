    "word": "Ministers are not to be called hither and thither to attend board meetings for the purpose of deciding common business questions. Many of our ministers have done this work in the past, but it is not the work in which the Lord wishes them to engage. Too many financial burdens have been placed on them. When they try to carry these burdens, they neglect to fulfil the gospel commission. God looks upon this as a dishonor to His name.--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. VII, pages 254, 255. \n\n[426]",
