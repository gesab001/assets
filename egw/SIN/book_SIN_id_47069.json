    "word": "For two nights I have had very plain dreams in regard to Dr. Burke. In these dreams it was plainly laid open before me that the reason Dr. Burke refused to see me was that he was guilty of wrong and sin, and refused to come to the light lest his deeds should be reproved. I am quite anxious to hear from the Rural Health Retreat, for Dr. Burke sent in his resignation just before we left. I am more and more convinced that rebellion is almost incurable. If a man proves a traitor once he is apt to become a traitor the second time. One thing is certain we cannot trust Dr Burke again under any circumstances, as he has gone as far as he has in denouncing me and my work. Never would he have done this if he had not for quite a length of time been walking in the sparks of his own kindling, separating himself from the Sun of righteousness.",
