    "word": "There were false dreams and false visions in abundance. Persons were reproving and rebuking others, accusing them of pride and selfishness, impurity and corruption. The light was given me, \"Believe them not.\" They mingled with their work a commonness, a cheapness of talk and action that was earthly and sensual. They met some with censure, then healed the wound with flattery, telling them they would do some great thing. The flattery part was pleasant, and deceived souls received the message as from God. The manifestations through Anna Phillips present the same features as did those we met in our experience long ago, and similar results will follow.",
