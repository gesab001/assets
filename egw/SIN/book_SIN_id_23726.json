    "word": "God has not only revealed to us the doctrine of the atonement, holding out the hope of eternal life, but his words are the manna from heaven for the soul to feed upon, and receive spiritual strength. The Bible is the great standard of right and wrong, clearly defining sin and holiness. Its living principles, running through our lives like threads of gold, are our only safeguard in all trials and temptations.",
