    "word": "\u201c\u2018Anna generally took his meals to him from \n298\nchoice, and then sat by his side while he ate; as she did not wish to eat until after he had. Said he, \u201cEllen, I wish you would make Anna sit down and eat with the rest of the family, for there is no need of her sitting by me while I eat.\u201d He seemed to love Anna very much, and through his sickness often spoke of his coming to Rochester to accompany her, because she was so feeble, and now she was waiting upon him, and often said, \u201cAnna, you did not know when you made up your mind to come to Rochester that you were coming to wait upon me.\u201d That night [Thursday] we went into his room and prayed with him, and he was abundantly blessed. He praised the Lord aloud, while his face lighted up with the glory of God. We especially prayed that he might have sleep and rest that night. He rested very well through the night. Friday morning, the last morning that he lived, he called us into his room. He said that he wished us to pray there, but first he had something to say. He then with remarkable clearness called up little things that had transpired while he had been with us, and every word that he thought he had spoken hastily or wrong he confessed heartily. He confessed wherein he had distrusted God in times past, and asked forgiveness of the family. \u201cI regret,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I have been unreconciled to my sickness. I have felt that I could not have it so, and that the Lord dealt hard with me. But I am now satisfied it is just; for nothing but this sickness could bring me where I am. God has blessed me much of late, and has forgiven me all my sins. It often seems that if I should reach out my hand I could embrace Jesus, he is so near. I know that I love God and he loves me.\u201d",
