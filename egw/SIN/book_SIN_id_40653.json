    "word": "Took a Walk, Wrote, and Read \n     [Denver] Sabbath, July 20, 1872. It is a beautiful morning. This is the Lord's rest day and we desire to keep the Sabbath that God may accept our efforts and that our own souls may be refreshed. We walked out, seeking a retired place in a grove where we could pray and read, but we were not successful. We spent the day in conversing upon religious subjects, writing, and reading.--Ms 4, 1872, p. 3. (Diary, July 14 to September 4, 1872.)",
