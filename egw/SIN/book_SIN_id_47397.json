    "word": "Since the Minneapolis meeting, your influence and that of Brother A.R. Henry have been like a malarious atmosphere upon the hearts of God's people. You have not sought to establish them in the truth, but rather to weaken their faith. You have been as salt which has lost its savor. Though still trusted by your brethren, you are an unfaithful steward. The seed Satan has put into your mind you have sown in the minds and hearts of others. Can you gather up these seeds of unbelief?---Never. They will spring up and yield a harvest you will not care to garner. \n                                                                           1350\nIn the day when every man is rewarded according to his works, God will look at the hearts which have been deceived by your doubts, and will say, \"An enemy hath done this.\" Your heart is not in the truth because the truth is not in your heart. But while mercy still lingers, go to God for repentance. Seek Him night and day, never relaxing your efforts. You are working out your own destiny, but you must work in opposite directions to that in which you have been working, if you are saved. Repent and be converted. Do all that you can to counteract the effects of your past work.",
