    "word": "Choice Rather than Numerous.--I am troubled in regard to the use of pictures in our publications. Some of our papers seem bent on using them in season and out of season. And some of the cuts used are very inferior, and poorly illustrate the subjects represented. I hope our publications will not come to resemble a comic almanac. I would not altogether condemn the use of pictures, but let fewer be used, and only such as are good illustrations of the subject. ... If you choose to have a few pictures and good ones, I do not object. Let illustrations be choice rather than numerous.--Letter 28a, 1897.",
