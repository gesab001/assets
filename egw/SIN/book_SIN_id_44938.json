Portions of this manuscript appear in Manuscript Release No. 201 and in Through Crisis to Victory.) \n\n\n     I beseech you by the mercy of God to be on your guard. To you and to other ministers and teachers the Lord says, \"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith.\" The world is full of speculation and false theories regarding the nature and character of God. The enemy of our souls is earnestly at work to introduce among the Lord's people pleasing speculation and incorrect views regarding the personality of God.",
