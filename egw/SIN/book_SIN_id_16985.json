    "word": "Everywhere the effects of the curse are seen. Let us praise God that in the earth made new \u201cthere shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him\u201d (Revelation 22:3). Some little know what true service means. Those who expect to sing in an entertainment spend time in practicing, to familiarize themselves with the music and the words. That we may learn how to serve the Lord in heaven, we must enter His service now, becoming acquainted with Him and learning to be faithful servants. . . .",
