    "word": "The holy law itself rejoiced in Christ's righteousness. The living representation of the law, Christ, could look around on a nation of witnesses, and say, \"Which of you convinceth Me of sin?\" Truth never languished on His lips, never suffered in His hands for want of perfect obedience to its requirements. \"To this end was I born,\" Christ declared, \"and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.\" And the mighty principles of truth fell from His lips with the freshness of a new revelation. The truth was spoken by Him with an earnestness proportionate to its infinite importance and to the momentous results depending on its success.",
