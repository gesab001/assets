    "word": "I love your souls. I want you to be undeceived. I want your blind eyes to be opened. I want you to buy the white raiment of Jesus Christ, the gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich. I plead with you, my brother, my sister, to do diligent work in repulsing the enemy. Resist him, through Jesus Christ. Would you be as [D. M.] Canright? The Lord is pitying you, and would save you from such a fate. The Lord will accept you as His servant, to help in saving souls, if you will learn obedience by the things you have suffered. Hold still, watch and pray, and die to self. \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with me\" (Isaiah 27:5). \n\n\n                                     -356-",
