    "word": "If pride and love of changeable fashion had not controlled the hearts and dress of those who profess to be God's commandment- keeping people, they would not have been so slow to change their style of dress. Varying fashion is controlling the hearts of youth. The Lord has let light shine, and in his providence a style of dress modest, healthful, and convenient, has been proposed and adopted by those who were conscientious to follow the light. This modest, healthful style of dress does not change with every varying fashion. If mothers would move from principle, and with the united influence of the father, dress their daughters sensibly, clothing their limbs in a manner to preserve health \n                                                                           62\nand life, irrespective of fashion, they would be doing a good work, which will be reflected back upon them again in blessings. Young girls who wear the reform dress are shielded from many temptations. They are continually learning to think and to act for themselves independent of what others may say and do. They are learning to have true moral courage to do right, and choose the right, although there is a cross in so doing. The majority of youth of this age have no strength to resist temptation. The inclination is strong to follow fashion, dress as worldlings do, and attend parties, and mingle with the world in their amusements.",
