    "word": "Wherever we look we see deformity caused by sin, and we all need a Saviour, one who will save to the uttermost. But we must do our part to work out our own salvation. I am so glad that I have a Saviour, one who can help me. God did not send angels to this world to save man, but His own Son, who suffered and was tempted on all points like as we are, and He knows how to succor all that are tempted and tried. This is done that we may have salvation. What more could have been done than has been done? This should evidence to us that God has great love for the human race, therefore in return He demands obedience from our hands. \n\n\n                                    -260-",
