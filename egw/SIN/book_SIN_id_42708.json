    "word": "If we come in contact with sinners who are hardened and bold in sin, they will seek to lead you to be as bad as themselves; but it is for you to heed the caution and the injunction of the Word of God: \"If sinners entice thee, consent thou not\" [Proverbs 1:10]. Send up your prayers to heaven that you may be delivered from temptation. Pray, pray, and put your will on the side of God's will. Oh, be sure to pray for the Lord to give you His grace to resist the devil, who caused the fall of Adam and Eve in Eden, and [who] with all his deceptive power will try to make of none effect the restrictions and commandments of God.",
