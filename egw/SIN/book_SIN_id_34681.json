    "word": "Chap. 43 - No Harsh Words nor Debating Spirit\n\n     Use of Truth As a Scourge--In the past you have presented the truth in a fierce way, using it as if it were a scourge. This has not glorified the Lord. You have given the people the rich treasures of God's Word, but your manner has been so condemnatory that they have turned from them. You have not taught the truth in the way that Christ taught it. You present it in a way that mars its influence. . . . Your heart needs to be filled with the converting grace of Christ.--Ev 173, 174.",
