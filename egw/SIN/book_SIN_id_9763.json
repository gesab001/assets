    "word": "470\n     There is danger of not making Christ's teachings a personal matter, of not receiving them as though they were addressed to us personally. In his words of instruction, Jesus means me. I may appropriate to myself his merits, his death, his cleansing blood, as fully as though there were not another sinner in the world for whom Christ died. In listening to his teachings, with understanding open to receive his words, we display the highest wisdom. In being doers of the word,\u2014obeying Christ by leading self-denying lives and forming pure and holy characters, \u2014we shall secure the life which measures with the life of God.",
