    "word": "I ask God's people to come to their senses in regard to their home duties. There are Christian parents who do not discern that Satan is working cunningly to catch unwary souls. Unless fathers and mothers become converted, unless they prayerfully consider the home duties which they have to perform, which it is sinful negligence to leave undone, unless they work strenuously at every point to outgeneral the enemy, their hearts will be pierced with many sorrows, for their children will be a disgrace to them and to the church.",
