    "word": "THE OBJECTION FOUNDED UPON 2 TIMOTHY 3:16, WHICH SOME HAVE GRAVELY PRESENTED, DESERVES NO MORE THAN A PASSING REMARK. IF PAUL, IN SAYING THAT THE SCRIPTURES ARE TO MAKE THE MAN OF GOD PERFECT, THOROUGHLY FURNISHED UNTO ALL GOOD WORKS, MEANT THAT NOTHING MORE SHOULD BE WRITTEN BY INSPIRATION, WHY WAS HE AT THAT MOMENT ADDING TO THOSE SCRIPTURES? AT LEAST WHY DID HE NOT DROP THE PEN AS SOON AS THAT SENTENCE WAS WRITTEN? AND WHY DID JOHN, THIRTY YEARS AFTERWARD, WRITE THE BOOK OF REVELATION? THIS BOOK CONTAINS ANOTHER TEXT \n                                                                           137\nWHICH IS QUOTED TO PROVE THE ABOLITION OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS.",
