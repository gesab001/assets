    "word": "Inexpensive Foods\n     The food business, if entered into largely, is going to be most perplexing and soul-harrowing. Those who take it up, whatever talent the Lord may give them, will meet with many perplexities. . . . I have been instructed that the production of health foods is of the Lord's devising, and is not to be regarded as the special property of any one man. But no one should take what I say as giving liberty to infringe on Dr. Kellogg's patents or the patents of any man.",
