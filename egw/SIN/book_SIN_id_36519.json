    "word": "The words of Christ have been plain and positive: \"Agonize to enter in at the strait gate; for many I say unto you shall seek to enter in and shall not be able.\" Professed Christians are not all so at heart. There are sinners in Zion now, as there were anciently. Isaiah speaks of them in referring to the day of God: \"The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting \n                                                                           11\nburnings? He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from the holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil. He shall dwell on high; his defense shall be the munitions of rocks; bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure.\"",
