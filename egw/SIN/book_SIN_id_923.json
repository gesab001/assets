    "word": "Among the children of Israel who were carried captive to Babylon at the beginning of the seventy years\u2019 captivity were Christian patriots, men who were as true as steel to principle, who \n53\nwould not be corrupted by selfishness, but who would honor God at the loss of all things. In the land of their captivity these men were to carry out God\u2019s purpose by giving to heathen nations the blessings that come through a knowledge of Jehovah. They were to be His representatives. Never were they to compromise with idolaters; their faith and their name as worshipers of the living God they were to bear as a high honor. And this they did. In prosperity and adversity they honored God, and God honored them.",
