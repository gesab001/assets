    "word": "The centuries that have passed since Christ was among men have not lessened the confidence of our testimony that Christ is all that He claimed to be. Today the question may be repeated, \"What think ye of Christ?\" (Matthew 22:42), and without a moment's hesitation the answer may be given, \"He is the light of the world, the greatest religious thinker and teacher the world has ever known.\" All who hear His voice today, all who study the principles set forth in His teaching, must say, in truthfulness, as did the Jews of His day, \"Never man spake like this man.\" \"Is not this the Christ?\" (John 7:46; 4:29).",
