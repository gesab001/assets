    "word": "Christ has died to save souls, and those who wear the yoke with Him will be copartners with Him, and will act in a Christlike manner. When a soul is in spiritual danger and falls from error into sin, such an one will not push him away, drive him to take desperate positions, and discourage him in every effort he may make to recover himself. Peter asked, \"Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven\" [Matthew 18:21, 22]. This is to make manifest the fact that there is no limit to the forgiving love of Christ.",
