    "word": "Now, my brother, I have some fears in regard to your dwelling with pen and voice so constantly upon Australia. It will be well to talk a reasonable amount and write about it, but dwelling upon it so much, I am \n\n\n                                     -317- \n\nafraid it will not bring the blessing of God into your present labors. You are not now in Australia. Put your energies and your thoughts into your present labor. Again, I am sure by a dream that was given me, we are searching for fruit and berries at great distance, when there is excellent fruit close by us. We want to pick not an inferior kind of fruit, but make efforts to get the large and sound fruit. I will write my dream to you soon. I had several pages written in reference to the school at South Lancaster, but Willie thinks I should make an article for the paper, and as it cannot be copied tonight I will send this just as it is and leave the matter I had written especially for the benefit of the school in South Lancaster.",
