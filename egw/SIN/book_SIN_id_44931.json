    "word": "We are living in these last days, when lukewarmness and apostasy abound. The apostle saw in prophetic vision what should exist near the close of time, and if our hearts were not calloused by sin and iniquity, we should discern and sense the prophetic picture held up to our view. [2 Timothy 3:1-5, quoted.] I cry out in remorse of soul, But who shall be able to stand when Christ shall come? [Malachi 3:2, 3, quoted.] Who shall stand the proving of God? Only those will bear the test, who have washed their robes of character and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.",
