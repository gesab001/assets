    "word": "Soon the work of God in the earth will close triumphantly. Soon those who have remained steadfast unto the end will be granted an abundant entrance into the kingdom of our Lord.

It is now our privilege to return unto the Lord His own, in free-will gifts and offerings; soon we shall receive the reward of the faithful.",
