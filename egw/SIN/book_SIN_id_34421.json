    "word": "Will you seek the Lord most earnestly? Pray, pray as humble seekers. Do not put your ingenuity to work to prove that others are evil, but tell them in tenderness to probe deeply their own sinful hearts, and pray that the Lord will purge the soul temple of sins. Let each confess his own sins; then may he draw nigh with full assurance of faith.--Letter 296, Sept. 9, 1906, to O. A. Olsen, at the time secretary of the North American Foreign Department of the General Conference.",
