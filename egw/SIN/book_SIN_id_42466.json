    "word": "The result of the last General Conference has been the greatest, the most terrible, sorrow of my life. No change was made. [SEE ALSO TESTIMONIES, VOL. 8, PP. 104-106. REFERENCE HERE IS NOT TO THE GENERAL CONFERENCE LEADERSHIP IN WHICH IMPORTANT CHANGES WERE MADE, BUT TO THE MEDICAL WORK IN PARTICULAR WHERE THE DESIRED CHANGES WERE NOT EFFECTED. SEE THE SDA ENCYCLOPEDIA (REVISED ED.), P. 1052. TWO MONTHS AFTER THE 1901 GENERAL CONFERENCE ELLEN WHITE WROTE, \"YOUR COURSE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE COURSE TO BE PURSUED IF NO CHANGE HAD BEEN MADE IN THE GENERAL CONFERENCE. BUT A CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE, AND MANY MORE CHANGES WILL BE MADE AND GREAT DEVELOPMENTS WILL BE SEEN. NO ISSUES ARE TO BE FORCED. . . . IT HURTS ME TO THINK THAT YOU ARE USING WORDS WHICH I WROTE PRIOR TO THE CONFERENCE. SINCE THE CONFERENCE GREAT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE (LETTER 54, 1901).] The spirit that \n\n\n                                 -123- \n\nshould have been brought into the whole work as the result of that meeting was not brought in because men did not receive the testimonies of the Spirit of God. As they went to their several fields of labor, they did not walk in the light that the Lord had flashed upon their pathway, but carried into their work the wrong principles that had been prevailing in the work at Battle Creek.",
