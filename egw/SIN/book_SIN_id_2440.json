    "word": "Those in charge of the work have erred sometimes in permitting the appointment of men devoid of business tact and ability to manage important financial interests.  A man's fitness for one position does not always qualify him to fill another position.  Experience is of great \n72\nvalue.  The Lord desires to have men of intelligence connected with His work,--men qualified for various positions of trust in our conferences and institutions.  Especially are consecrated business men needed,--men who will carry the principles of truth into every business transaction.  Those placed in charge of financial matters should not assume other burdens,--burdens that they are incapable of bearing; nor is the business management to be entrusted to incompetent men.--Review and Herald, Oct. 5, 1905.",
