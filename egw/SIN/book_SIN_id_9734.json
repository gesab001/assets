    "word": "Brethren, if the eye be single, you will have well-balanced minds, and in principle you will be firm as a rock. You will remember that the eye of God is upon you, overseeing your labor; and you will move on from strength to strength, from grace to grace, gathering rays of light to reflect upon the pathway of others. Be strong in the grace of Christ, and let your hearts be filled with love to God and to one another. Remember that if you are partakers of the sufferings of Christ, you shall be also of the consolation. Though sorrowful, you may be \u201calway rejoicing.\u201d [2 Corinthians 6:10.] Brethren, have courage in the Lord.",
