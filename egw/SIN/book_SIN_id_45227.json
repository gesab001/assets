    "word": "It is the greatest and most fatal deception to suppose that a man can have faith unto life eternal without possessing Christlike love for his brethren. He who loves God and his neighbor is filled with light and love. God is in him and all around him. Christians love those around them as precious souls for whom Christ has died. There is no such thing as a loveless Christian, for \"God is love.\" [1 John 2:3-5, 8-11; John 13:34, 35; 15:12, quoted.]--Ms 133, 1899. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nMay 9 1991. Entire Ms.",
