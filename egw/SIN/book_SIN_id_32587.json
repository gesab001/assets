    "word": "Love for a lost world was manifested every day, in every act of His life. Those who are imbued by His Spirit will work in the same lines as those in which Christ worked. In Christ the light and love of God were manifested in human nature. No human being has ever possessed so sensitive a nature as did the sinless, holy One of God, who stood as head and representative of what humanity may become through the imparting of the divine nature. To those who believe in Christ as their personal Saviour, He imputes His merit and imparts His power. To those who come to Him with their burden of grief, disappointments, and trials, He will give rest and peace. It is through the grace of Christ that the soul sees his need of repentance toward God. . ., and is led to look to Christ by faith, realizing that His merit is efficacious to save to the uttermost all who come unto God by Him. . . . Let us open our hearts to receive the love which it is so essential that we should cultivate in order that we may fulfill the commandments of God.",
