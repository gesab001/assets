    "word": "Rebuilding and Witnessing in Mountain View.--If it seems best that the office shall be rebuilt in Mountain View, then let everyone connected with the work here be a missionary, a blessing to those who know not the truth. \"Ye are laborers together with God.\" Think how tender Christ was with all who came to Him for help. If all will look, not at the faults of others, but at their own shortcomings, and see that they individually carry out the true principles of the law of God, our brethren and sisters will be a blessing to the community.",
