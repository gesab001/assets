    "word": "Dr. Osborn is a man of intelligence, a man who loves the truth but one who will need to be dealt with considerately for his years and for his position as a man of influence. Those who have had no authority and who should not feel that it developed upon them to handle such men have felt free to move and act in a most unwise manner. Their course has made the doctor regard them with contempt. The course pursued toward Doctor Osborn has been all wrong. Had this man been handled judiciously he would have been a blessing to the church. He has used tobacco to a greater or less degree, but this habit was not as offensive in the sight of God as the defects in the character of those who might judge him, for God weighs the motives.",
