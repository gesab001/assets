    "word": "VI. Christ Both Sacrificial Offering and Officiating Priest \n\n\n     The infinite sufficiency of Christ is demonstrated by His bearing the sins of the whole world. He occupies the double position of offerer and of offering, of priest and of victim. He was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners. \"The prince of this world cometh,\" He declares, \"and findeth nothing in Me.\" He was a Lamb without blemish, and without spot.--Letter 192, 1906.",
