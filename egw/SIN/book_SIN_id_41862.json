    "word": "Management Responsibilities to Be Delegated--The management of the business interests of the sanitarium should not rest upon the doctor [J. H. Kellogg] as it has done. Others must attend to such matters. A multitude of cares may thus be removed from him. He should make every exertion on his part to qualify men to engage with him in the work, and should give them an opportunity to share his responsibilities. This would be a mercy to himself and a great blessing to them. Unless he does make efforts to save himself, he will become, unexpectedly to himself, a complete wreck, when with proper exercise of his powers, restraining inclination, he might be able to do a good work, enduring as eternity. \n\n\n                                  -79-",
