    "word": "The Word of God clearly points out our duty. We are to cultivate kindness and forbearance and love. We are to represent Christ in character. Evil speaking, accusing, and faultfinding, misrepresenting our brethren because our own individual ideas are not considered as of the highest value, can find no place in a Christian's life. By our conduct we show what our influence and the principles we hold are worth. If self is our center, self will be seen in all we do. If Christ is our center, we shall bear His likeness. [1 Thessalonians 5:9-15 quoted.]",
