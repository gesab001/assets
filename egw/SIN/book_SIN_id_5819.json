He desired to show his gratitude, and at Christ's last visit to Bethany he made a feast for the Saviour and His disciples. . . . At the table the Saviour sat with Simon . . . on one side and Lazarus . . . on the other. Martha served at the table, but Mary was earnestly listening to every word from the lips of Jesus. In His mercy, Jesus had pardoned her sins, He had called forth her beloved brother from the grave, and Mary's heart was filled with gratitude.
