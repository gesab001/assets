    "word": "And though sin existed for ages, seeking to counteract the merciful tide of love flowing from God to the human race, yet the love and care that God bestows upon the beings he has created in his own image, has not ceased to increase in richness and abundance. \"God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" He crowned his benevolence by the inestimable gift of Jesus. By this sacrifice, a healing flood of life and heavenly grace was poured upon our world. This was God's gift to man,--a gift that defies all computation. By giving his Son, God made it impossible for man to say that he could have done more: and the mind of man is put to the utmost stretch in the effort to comprehend this wonderful love.",
