    "word": "A great mistake has been made in the outlay of means in Oakland, Cal., and in Battle Creek, causing an accumulation of debts \n                                                                           34\nwhich have involved these institutions in embarrassment. Now the evil of this is fully seen, and the pressure is felt. But it is with them as with a bank; if the impression goes out that failure is imminent, all who have intrusted their money in them will rush to call it out. The greatest wisdom is now required to manage these important institutions in such a manner that the difficulties which threaten to ruin them may be overcome. All may come out in safety by managing judiciously and economically, and keeping the embarrassment under which they are laboring as close as possible. A few injudicious words spoken without thought by my husband will do a work he can never undo if he would. He will awaken the fears of those who have invested means, and will lead them to withdraw it, which must ruin the Sanitarium and our publishing house on the Pacific coast. If we will labor with courage now, in this financial crisis, prudently, disinterestedly, calling in means, the difficulty will be overcome.",
