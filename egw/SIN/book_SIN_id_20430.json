    "word": "Guard Memory of Pioneers \n\n     As those who took up the work at the beginning of the message have advanced by self-denial and self-sacrifice, God has given them His blessing.  They have had much to learn, they have made mistakes, they have needed continual guidance and counsel; but they have had reason for constant gratitude, because the work has gone forward in spite of poverty and a lack of facilities. They strained every nerve to make the work a success, to establish those buildings which were necessary for the proper development of the work; and under all circumstances the Lord guided them. \n                                                                           26",
