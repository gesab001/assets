    "word": "To get hold at all in New York is a great thing, and a wonderful thing. The Lord has given Elder Franke his appointment and gift, varying from yours. Do not suppose that will destroy your opportunities. I feel most anxious lest you will carry a load on your shoulders that will make you very unhappy and sick. Thank God that he has appointed men who can draw the class that it is difficult to reach. That is how I look at the matter, and that is what I am saying to you with great earnestness in the night season. The Lord has a work for you to do, and one for Elder Franke to do also. He has laid out this work just as clearly as possible; but it does not exactly meet your mind. Now let God fix up the matter. Let each light be trimmed and burning, each shining amid the moral darkness of that awfully wicked city, dead in trespasses and sins. A Paul may plant, and Apollos may water; but it is God that giveth the increase. Let each man do his best. You lost your courage over your worrying. Now sweetly, hopefully feel the interest God has in His workers. \n\n\n                                   -241-",
