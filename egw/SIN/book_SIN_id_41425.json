    "word": "MR No. 732 - Letter to a Colporteur\n\n     The Lord's Way of Bringing the Truth to Many.-- I have just received and read your very interesting letter. Thank you for writing. We are indeed glad to hear that you have such encouraging success. I think that this is the Lord's way of bringing the truth to many, and I praise His name for the success that attends your efforts. I know that people will be blessed in reading the books you mention in your letter. I think that Mount of Blessing and Steps to Christ are excellent books. They are small, but both are full of instruction.",
