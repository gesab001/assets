    "word": "Those who labor at camp-meeting should have an appreciation of the importance and solemnity of their work. They should not imagine that a display of oratory, a discourse made up of flashy rhetoric, spoken in a loud voice, is something essential to the salvation of souls. The minister should learn to speak in a clear, low voice, using the vocal organs in such a way that the throat and lungs will not be taxed or injured. He should cultivate a pleasing manner, and give discourses short and to the point. In this way neither minister nor people will be wearied.",
