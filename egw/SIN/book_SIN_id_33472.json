    "word": "Ezra gave special study to the experiences of God\u2019s chosen people, from the time the promise was made to Abraham, to the deliverance from Egyptian bondage and the exodus.

Some of the prophecies were about to be fulfilled; he would search diligently for the light that had been obscured.",
