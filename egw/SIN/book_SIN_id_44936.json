    "word": "Men of the world hate the Bible, because it will not let them sin just as they please and carry along with them their hereditary and cultivated traits of character. They want their own ideas to be cherished as the mind of God. They oppose the Word of God for the same reason that the Jews cried \"Away with Christ!\"--because He rebuked their sins and laid bare their iniquities.",
