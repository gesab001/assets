    "word": "Letter 74, 1892, p. 7. (To W. C. White, October 10, 1892.)-- Willie, I did not expect to write so long a letter, but I traced out this matter as I have now. If you will put this into Fannie's hands, and let her put it into shape, cutting out the stove business and anything you deem best, I will make this letter serve so that it will save me writing to Elder Haskell and some other long letters. Please consider this, and if Fannie arranges it in shape, send it back to me.",
