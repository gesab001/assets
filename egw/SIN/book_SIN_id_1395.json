    "word": "Joseph bore the test of character in adversity, and the gold was undimmed by prosperity. He showed the same sacred regard for God\u2019s will when he stood next to the throne as when in the prisoner\u2019s cell. Joseph carried his religion everywhere, and this was the secret of his unwavering fidelity. As a representative of Christ, you must have the all-pervading power of godliness. You must be hid in Jesus. You are not safe unless you hold the hand of Christ. You must guard against everything like presumption and cherish that spirit that would rather suffer than sin. No victory you can gain will be so precious as that gained over self. Selfish ambition, desire for supremacy, will die when Christ takes possession of the affections.\u2014Manuscript 14, 1889.",
