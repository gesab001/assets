    "word": "And in your Board meetings, I want to tell you, from the light that has been given me, there is something that must be corrected. It is this: If there is one that sees a little item, a little thing, that he can hang upon, and if he feels that he can manifest his sharpness by going and spreading it right out, and holding it on, and holding these Board meetings, until they are just wearisome\u2014it is just as a man who is putting his foot on the brake, and keeping it there, as they have done again and again, so that nothing can move until they have his sanction. When you find that that is the particular trait of any man\u2019s character, wherever it is, you do him the greatest injury that you can possibly do a man, to put him as a member on your Board, where he can exercise that criticism which he has no business to exercise.",
