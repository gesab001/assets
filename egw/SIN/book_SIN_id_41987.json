    "word": "Minneapolis Spirit Made EGW's Labors More Difficult--Brethren you are urging me to come to your camp meetings. I must tell you plainly that the course pursued toward me and my work since the General Conference at Minneapolis--your resistance of the light and warnings that God has given through me--has made my labor fifty times harder than it would otherwise have been. I find that my words have far less influence upon the minds of our people that upon unbelievers whose hearts have not been hardened by rejecting the light. I have no word from the Lord to labor for you in the camp meetings, to repeat to you, little by little, that which at great cost and labor I have published for your benefit. As you feel no burden to obtain and circulate \n\n\n                                    -260- \n\nthe books, I feel that my oral testimony would make no lasting impression. I have no courage to meet you in camp meeting. It seems to me that you have cast aside the word of the Lord as unworthy of your notice.--Letter 1, 1890, p. 10. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. November 12, 1981",
