    "word": "Heaven and earth will pass away, but not one jot or tittle of the word of God will fail. It will endure forever. All men, whatever their position, whatever their religion, loyal or disloyal to God, wicked or righteous, are fitting themselves to do their work in the closing scenes of the day of the Lord. They will trample down each other as they act out their natural attributes and fulfill their purposes; but they will carry out the purpose of God. The priests thought they were carrying out their own purposes, but unconsciously and unintentionally they were fulfilling the purpose of God. He \"revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him.\" \n\n\n                                        -186-",
