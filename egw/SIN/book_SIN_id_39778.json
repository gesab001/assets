    "word": "-301- \n\n\n                               Eternal Truth \n      We stand as the remnant people in these last days to promulgate the truth and swell the cry of the third angel's wonderful distinct message, giving the trumpet a certain sound. Eternal truth, which we have adhered to from the beginning is to be maintained in all its increasing importance to the close of probation. The trumpet is to give no uncertain sound. We must devise and plan wisely, practicing simplicity and the strictest economy and manifesting Christ's likeness of character. Faith, eternal faith in the past and in the present truth is to be talked, is to be prayed, is to be presented with pen and voice.--Letter 121, 1900, p. 5. (To Elder and Mrs. S. N. Haskell, typed Aug. 13, 1900.) \n\nReleased April 28, 1967.",
