    "word": "The managers in our institutions should be earnest men of prayer, men who possess self-control, and who cling to Jesus, enjoying His perpetual presence. This is their privilege.

They gather about them those who bring holy angels into the midst of the workers, and not influences that taint the very atmosphere they breathe.",
