    "word": "It is not in God's order that parents who are capable of managing their own business, should give up the control of their property, even to children who are of the same faith.  These seldom possess as much devotion to the cause as they should, and they have not been schooled in adversity and affliction, so as to place a high estimate upon the eternal treasure, and less upon the earthly. The means placed in the hands of such is the greatest evil.  It is a temptation to them to place their affections upon the earthly, and trust to property, and feel that they need but little besides.  When means which they have not acquired by their own exertion, comes into their possession, they seldom use it wisely.",
