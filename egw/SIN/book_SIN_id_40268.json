    "word": "Wednesday, June 30, 1897. . . . We rode to the post office. The twins, Herbert and James Henry, saw the horse and wagon at the door and both came running to their grandmother with their little arms outstretched, full of expectation that I would take them. I could not have the heart to disappoint them. Their wraps were thrown on and Sara cared for one and I for the other, and then they were perfectly happy, having a hold of the end of the lines and supposing they were driving.--Ms 173, 1897, p. 6. (Diary, June, 1897.)",
