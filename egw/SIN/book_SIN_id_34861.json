    "word": "Praise in Ezra's Day--Then from the assembled throng [during the Feast of Trumpets in Ezra's time after the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall], as they stood with outstretched hands toward heaven, there arose the song: \"Blessed be Thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. Thou, even Thou, art Lord alone; Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth Thee\" [Nehemiah 9:5, 6]. The song of praise ended, the leaders of the congregation related the history of Israel, showing how great had been God's goodness toward them, and how great their ingratitude.--PK 666.",
