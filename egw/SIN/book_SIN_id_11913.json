    "word": "The work of overcoming is a great work. Shall we take hold of it with energy and perseverance? Unless we do, our \u201cfilthy garments\u201d will not be taken from us. We need never expect that these will be torn from us violently; we must first show a desire to rid ourselves of them. We must seek to separate sin from us, relying upon the merits of the blood of Christ; and then in the day of affliction, when the enemy presses us, we shall walk among the angels. They will be like a wall of fire about us; and we shall one day walk with them in the city of God.",
