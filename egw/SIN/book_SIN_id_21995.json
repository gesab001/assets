Saul Did Not Sense His Own Guilt.--When the people had satisfied their hunger, Saul proposed to continue the pursuit that night; but the priest suggested that it would be wiser first to ask counsel of God.

How many cherish a proud, boastful spirit, while they indulge in cruel judgment or severe rebuke of others really better in heart and life than they. Well would it be for such self-constituted judges to ponder those words of Christ: \"With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again\" (ST Aug. 17, 1882).",
