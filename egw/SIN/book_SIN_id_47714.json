    "word": "Because the spiritual eyesight of some in positions of trust has been clouded, God's great and sacred work has been neglected. Justice, mercy, and the love of God have not been manifested. By their deeds some have shown that they have not been actuated by right principles. A practical evidence of love for their brethren has been wanting. While very scrupulous about little matters, making a man an offender for a word, they have not scrupled, by dealing unjustly with the heritage of the Lord, to commit sins that are great in the sight of God.",
