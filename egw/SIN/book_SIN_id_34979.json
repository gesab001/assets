    "word": "Frugal; Collect Every Fragment.--\"Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost.\" He who had all resources at His command gives a lesson that not a fragment should be wasted. He who has plenty should not waste. Let nothing be wasted that can do good to any one. Collect every fragment, for someone will need it. These lessons in regard to spiritual blessings bestowed are to be carefully treasured.--Manuscript 60, 1897.",
