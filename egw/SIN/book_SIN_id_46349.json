    "word": "In true conversion, the sinner is first convicted of his real condition. He realizes that he is a transgressor of God's law, and that the Lord has claims upon him which He will not relinquish. He sees that the connection between himself and God has been broken, but that if he repents of his transgression, confesses his sin, and takes hold by faith upon the grace of Christ, the connection that has been broken will be restored.",
