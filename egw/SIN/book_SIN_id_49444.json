    "word": "\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. . . . . and thy neighbor as thyself.\" This is God's command. Jesus has given an additional requirement: \"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\" Man never knew the strength of that love until Christ came to this earth and gave his life for sinners. \"Greater love hath no man than this, That a man lay down his life for his friends.\" We are not merely to love our neighbor as ourselves; we are to love one another as Christ has loved us. \"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you,\" he declared, \"continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you.\"",
