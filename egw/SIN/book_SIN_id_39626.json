    "word": "Henry and Herbert, you are growing old enough to be able to study, able to exercise your physical and mental powers. You are to learn to pray and to be obedient. In this way you can be a great blessing to your mother, and she will not grieve so much because of your father's absence. The Lord Jesus will be pleased because you are trying to be His own little children. You are to be always truthful, and always kind and pleasant and gentle and obedient to your dear mother. Do not do or say anything that will grieve her heart.",
