    "word": "500. Tobacco using is a habit which frequently affects the nervous system in a more powerful manner than does the use of alcohol.

Body and mind are, in many cases, more thoroughly intoxicated with the use of tobacco than with spirituous liquors; for it is a more subtle poison.--T., V. III, p. 562.",
