    "word": "Every church shall move in God's order, following his plan of communion and Christian oneness. The whole body of believers are to be one in spirit. They are collectively the church of Jesus Christ. Standing in this widely extended missionary territory, the church should be calling the sinful to look at the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world. This work is to go forward. Those who have taken upon themselves to carry a measuring line that they may measure all, and say how things shall go, may now be excused from this responsibility.",
