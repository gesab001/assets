    "word": "God designs that the interest of the workers shall be absorbed in his will. He says. \u201cI will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\u201d A soul is of more value than all the world; and to let things of a temporal nature come in between us and the work of saving souls is displeasing to the God of heaven. As a people, we have as yet scarcely begun to realize the importance of the work intrusted to us. Oh that the servants of God might have a new touch from his divine power! Oh that they had more faith to prevail with God in prayer, and more, far more, earnestness and perseverance in their labors!",
