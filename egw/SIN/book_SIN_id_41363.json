    "word": "To Know that the Men Working with Him Have Clean Hands \n     The president of the conference should learn whether the business transactions are carried on with the strictest integrity. He should know whether they are presided over by men who have clean hands. His indignation should be aroused against the slightest approach to a mean, selfish action. Let one wrong deed be practiced and approved, and the second and third will follow in the same line of fraudulent deception.--Letter 4, 1896, p. 3.",
