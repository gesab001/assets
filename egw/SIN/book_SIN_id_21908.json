    "word": "2-5. Burning Bush a Reality.--It will baffle the keenest intellect to interpret the divine manifestation of the burning bush. It was not a dream; it was not a vision; it was a living reality,--something that Moses saw with his eyes. He heard the voice of God calling to him out of the bush, and he covered his face, realizing that he stood in the immediate presence of God. God was conversing with humanity. Never could Moses describe the impression made upon his mind by the sight he then saw, and by the sound of the voice that spoke to him; but this impression was never effaced. Heaven came very near to him as, with reverent awe, he listened to the words, \"I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" What wondrous condescension for God to leave the heavenly courts, and manifest Himself to Moses, talking with him face to face, \"as a man speaketh unto his friend\" (Ibid., Dec. 20, 1900).",
