I also stated that I saw the Father rise from the throne. The Father was enshrouded with a body of light and glory, so that his person could not be seen, yet I knew that it was the Father, and that from his person, emanated this light and glory. When I saw this body of light and glory rise from the throne, I knew that the Father moved, which was the cause of the body of light and glory rising, therefore said, I saw the Father rise. \n\n                                                                           34\nThe glory, or excellency of his form, I never saw--no one could behold it; yet the body of light and glory that enshrouded his person, could be seen.",
