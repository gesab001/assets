The psalmist says: \n\n\n     \"Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. \n      Righteousness and judgment are the foundation of thy throne: \n      Mercy and truth go before thy face. \n      Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound; \n      They walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance. \n      In thy name do they rejoice all the day; \n      And in thy righteousness are they exalted. \n      For thou art the glory of their strength....\" Psalm 89:13-18, R.V.",
