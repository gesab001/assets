    "word": "The Character of the Workers. \n\n     God wants all who are connected with the Sanitarium, whether as physicians, superintendents, or those officiating in any department, to be just what the Bible requires,--exemplary Christians. All their business transactions, whether with believers or unbelievers, should be as transparent as sunlight. The fact that one is not likely to be detected in deception or fraud, or downright murder in malpractise, does not make him less guilty in the sight of God. That which God testifies of us when character is weighed in the golden scales of the sanctuary will stand fast forever, unless the sad decision, \"Wanting,\" is changed because of soul repentance and transformation of character, and pardon is written, and the promise fulfilled, \"A new heart will I give you.\" There is need of an entire change in the principles that control many physicians in regard to their example as Christians. They must meet a higher standard, --the Bible standard.",
