    "word": "If the students make mistakes, let him not think them unworthy to be placed on trial again, as though they had committed sins that cannot be forgiven.

To cast off the erring, or to treat them coldly, would not be doing as Christ has done for him. We are all fallible, and need the pity and consideration and forgiveness of one another. He cannot find perfection anywhere, and should not expect it, but he must bear with the perversity of men, and try to teach them.--Letter 1, 1885.",
