    "word": "Captain Norman. [Written from] \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, N.S.W. Dear Sister Henry: We are greatly surprised to learn in regard to Captain Norman's donation; but it does not trouble me at all; all anxiety is removed. The Lord knows all about the matter. I cannot explain how it is, unless the man was unbalanced in mind and really thought to perform all these good purposes. He must have been under a species of insanity, for otherwise he must have known that the thing purposed would, if not carried out, expose him as a deceiver. It is a wonderful thing, and we all consider that the Lord knows how to turn it to our best advantage. The Lord certainly does not want us to be mocked. But I have had presented to me that the influence of his donation would test character and lead to the withholding of means which should come to us from America. Had Captain Norman never appeared with his donations, many would have received a blessing in giving. \n\n                                                                --",
