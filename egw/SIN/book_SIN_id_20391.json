    "word": "John enjoyed the blessing of true sanctification. But mark, the apostle does not claim to be sinless; he is seeking perfection by walking in the light of God's countenance. He testifies that the man who professes to know God, and yet breaks the divine law, gives the lie to his profession. \"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him\" (1 John 2:4).",
