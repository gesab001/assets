    "word": "Do not speak words that will irritate or offend. The Lord desires you to guard every point in your character. You can be a blessing in communicating to others your knowledge of the truth and of health reform, but do not enter into a detailed explanation of the bodily functions, as you have often done in the past. Dwell on that which it is necessary to know in order to preserve health, using such simple language that children can understand you. But the intricacies that a physician must know in his profession do not interest those who are profoundly ignorant.",
