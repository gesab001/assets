    "word": "Men professing to have great and new light, claiming to be reformers, will have great power over a certain class of minds that are convinced of the heresies that exist and are not satisfied with the spiritual condition of the churches. With true, honest hearts they desire to see a reform for the better, a coming up to a higher standard. And if the servants of Jesus Christ would present to this class the truth for this time, pure and unadulterated, they would accept it and purify themselves by obeying the truth.",
