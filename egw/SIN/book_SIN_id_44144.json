    "word": "The weather was wet while we were at Des Moines, but when we held meetings the chapel was filled with people, and the Lord gave me a message for those assembled. I spoke twice at this place. Several ministers were present, and we are sure the meeting will be a blessing to those assembled. My message was especially upon the necessity of preserving unity and love, which at this time the people of God must cherish for one another. I spoke about the medical missionary work and the small sympathy Dr. Kellogg had received in his work. I asked them to compare the work he had been doing with the work they had been doing. All seemed to see that they had not acted wisely, and I hope that in the future there will be less friction.",
