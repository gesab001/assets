    "word": "Our own people are in want. I have divided with Sister A the provisions which have been bought at auction sales, and have also placed a pound in her hands. Her husband has been canvassing with Brother G, but poverty has met them on every side. The people wanted the books, but with tears in their eyes they said, \"We cannot buy. We must have bread or starve.\" Sister A received a letter from her husband in which he stated that he was two pounds in debt at the hotel and asked her to sell some articles from the meager lot of furniture still remaining in order that he might pay his debt. When I heard this, I rode up with Sister B to carry supplies of food to them, for I knew they were in want. She was very grateful for this. You know they have a large but excellent family.--Lt 54a, 1894.",
