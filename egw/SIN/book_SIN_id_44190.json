    "word": "All earthly honor is perishable, all earthly treasures valueless when we are passing from this life. There will be nothing enduring but the heavenly treasure, and the favor of God will be more valuable than choice gold. There is time now to prepare for the future immortal life. It will not answer to neglect the preparation essential for our heavenly home. But many will be found wanting in that great day. The precious hours of probation will have passed by unimproved, and when it is too late the mournful cry will be heard, The harvest is passed, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved. When the righteous Judge shall proclaim the destiny of all fixed--\"He which is filthy, let him be filthy still...and he that is holy, let him be holy still\"--it will be a time when the most careless, the most trifling will come to their senses and discern that the truly wise were those who loved God and kept His commandments.",
