    "word": "\"Hold fast.\" This does not mean, Hold fast to your sins; but, hold fast to the comfort, the faith, the hope, that God has given you in His Word. Never be discouraged. A discouraged man can do nothing. Satan is seeking to discourage you, telling you it is of no use to serve God, that it does not pay, and that it is just as well to have pleasure and enjoyment in this world. But \"what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul\"? You may have worldly pleasure at the expense of the future world; but can you afford to pay such a price? We are to \"hold fast\" and live up to all the light we receive from heaven. Why?--Because God wants us to grasp the eternal truth, and act as His helping hand by communicating the light to those who are not acquainted with His love for them. When you gave yourself to Christ, you made a pledge in the presence of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,--the three great personal Dignitaries of heaven. \"Hold fast\" to this pledge. . . .",
