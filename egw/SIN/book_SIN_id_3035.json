    "word": "The Saviour's Voice.--The Saviour's voice was as music to the ears of those who had been accustomed to the monotonous, spiritless preaching of the scribes and Pharisees. He spoke slowly and impressively, emphasizing those words to which He wished His hearers to give special heed. . . . The power of speech is of great value, and the voice should be cultivated for the blessing of those with whom we come in contact.--Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, p. 240. (1913)",
