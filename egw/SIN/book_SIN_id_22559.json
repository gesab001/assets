    "word": "We should be warned not to associate with those who by their course of action lay a stumbling block in the way of others. \"If any man obey not our word by this epistle,\" the apostle says, \"note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.\" If he refuses the admonition of the Lord's servants, and follows his own will and judgment under the inspiration of his leader, Satan, he will bring ruin upon himself, and must bear his own sin.",
