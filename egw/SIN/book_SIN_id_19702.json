    "word": "I have been shown that the abundant picture making for our periodicals and books is growing into an unsanctified ambition, and the dangers of rivalry are increasing to an alarming extent. The books we are sending out to the \n\n216 \n\nworld are costing too much. Extravagance in illustrations costs time and money and creates worries which can and should be avoided. The Lord would have us keep the eye single to the glory of God. This infatuation for so abundant illustrations is not in God's order; it is the pulse of the world, and this is beating strongly in God's people at the present time.--Lt 147, 1899.",
