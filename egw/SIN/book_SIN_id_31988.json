    "word": "The sick should be educated to have confidence in nature's blessings which God has provided, and the most effective remedies for disease are pure, soft water; the blessed God-given sunshine coming into the rooms of the invalids; living outdoors as much as possible; having healthful exercise; eating and drinking in foods that are prepared in the most healthful manner. To resort to the drugging process lays upon nature a most fearful, merciless burden, from which they may never recover. There are many laboring under chronic diseases. They will swallow anything in the line of drugs prescribed by the unbelieving physician, when an intelligent knowledge that they are indulging in unnatural appetites which explains to them the cause of their suffering, if Christians, they would place themselves in a position as health reformers. They would change the cause which produces this sure result.",
