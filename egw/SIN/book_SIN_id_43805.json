    "word": "By dying on the cross Christ gave His life as an offering for sin, that through His power man might turn from his sins, become converted, and be a laborer together with God. Greater love than this can never be shown. More could not be done than has been done to demonstrate the immutability of the law of God. Christ did not die to abolish the law or to detract in the slightest degree from its influence or power. He died to exalt the law and make it honorable. Full of goodness, compassion, and love, He hated only one thing--sin, \"the transgression of the law.\" In the very act of dying to save that which was lost, Christ reached the perfect standard of obedience as our Substitute and Surety. His death exemplified the curse of sin.",
