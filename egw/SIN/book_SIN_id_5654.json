    "word": "Exalt Not Human Beings.--In the night I was earnestly addressing those who are bearing responsibilities of editors and contributors of our periodicals. . . . If those in charge of our periodicals have no more judgment than to fill the publications with the exaltations of human beings, then let them seek wisdom from God. Your spiritual eyesight needs the heavenly anointing. . . . In pouring forth an overflow of praise of one whom they do not know, who has not accepted a \"Thus saith the Lord\" in keeping His commandments, they place themselves where, in the crisis coming upon us, they will have defective discernment as they shall see the good things done by those who will seek to deceive, who will claim to be Christ and prophets sent of God.",
