    "word": "Jesus says, \"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame\" [Revelation 16:15]. Here is the great burden to be carried away by every individual. Are my sins forgiven? Has Christ, the Burden-bearer, taken away my guilt? Have I a clean heart, the righteousness of Jesus Christ, by faith? Woe be to any soul who is not seeking a refuge in Christ, and conforming the character to the character of Christ. Woe be [to] all who shall in anywise divert the mind from this work, and cause any soul to be less vigilant now. \n\n\n                                   -63-",
