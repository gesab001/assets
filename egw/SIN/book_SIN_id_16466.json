    "word": "Constant, self-denying benevolence is God's remedy for the cankering sins of selfishness and covetousness. God has arranged systematic benevolence to sustain His cause and relieve the necessities of the suffering and needy. He has ordained that giving should become a habit, that it may counteract the dangerous and deceitful sin of covetousness. Continual giving starves covetousness to death. . . . He requires the constant exercise of benevolence, that the force of habit in good works may break the force of habit in an opposite direction. \n                                                                           334",
