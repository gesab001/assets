    "word": "Let the work in the South be carried forward decidedly. Sanitariums must be provided for the sick. There is talent among the colored people, but where is the missionary spirit to seek for and to cultivate this talent? How much is being done by Seventh-day Adventists in caring for the sick and the ignorant? In many places civilization is almost unknown. Sin and degradation abound. Millions are perishing in ignorance. Some of our faithful missionaries have become discouraged because so little encouragement has been given them. But the divine message must come to the colored race. Preach to them the precious words of the Lord Jesus.",
