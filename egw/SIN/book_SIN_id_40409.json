    "word": "Hoops, I saw, should be discarded from the ranks of Sabbathkeepers. Their influence and practice should be a rebuke to this ridiculous fashion which has been a screen to iniquity. Its first rise was from a house of ill fame in Paris. Never was such iniquity practiced as since this hoop invention; never were there so many murders of infants and never were virtue and modesty so rare. It has almost departed from this enlightened land.--Letter 16a, 1861. (To the Church in Roosevelt, New York, August 3, 1861.)",
