    "word": "PRAYERS NOT ALWAYS ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY.\u2014God has a heaven full of blessings for those who will co-operate with Him. All who obey Him may with confidence claim the fulfillment of His promises. \n106\nBut we must show a firm, undeviating trust in God. Often He delays to answer us in order to try our faith or test the genuineness of our desire. Having asked according to His word, we should believe His promise and press our petitions with a determination that will not be denied.\u2014(Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 145.)",
