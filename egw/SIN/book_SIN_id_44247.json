    "word": "Last Friday night I awakened in severe pain, and felt that I should suffocate for want of breath. I could obtain no relief. I thought I might die. My pulse was very feeble, missing every third beat. I dared not close my eyes in sleep. I made my prayer unto God that He might bring me relief. After midnight I went to sleep; but next morning my countenance revealed the suffering hours through which I had passed. I dared not sit up, but lay in bed most of the time until it was time to dress for meeting.",
