    "word": "The Lord commands His people to go forward, from light to a greater light. Some have had great light, they have been blessed, they have believed that God, for Christ's sake, forgave their sins, but there they have stopped, and have made no further advancement. They have not attained unto a greater faith or broader experience, because they have not received the light of the truth which is constantly unfolding to those who follow the Light of the world. The blood of Christ cleanseth from all unrighteousness, but just as soon as a soul ceases to walk by faith, he becomes enshrouded in darkness.",
