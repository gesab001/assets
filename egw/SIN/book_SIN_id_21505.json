    "word": "Ellen G. White Message Consistent Through the Years.--The meeting on Sunday afternoon was attended by many of the citizens of Battle Creek. They paid the best of attention. At this meeting I had opportunity to state decidedly that my views have not changed. The blessing of the Lord rested upon many of those who heard the words spoken. I said: \"You may be anxious to know what Mrs. White believes. You have heard her speak many times. . . . She has the same service to do for the Master that she had when she addressed the people of Battle Creek years ago. She receives lessons from the same Instructor. The directions given her are, 'Write the messages that I give you, that the people may have them.' These messages have been written as God has given them to me.\"--Letter 39, 1905.",
