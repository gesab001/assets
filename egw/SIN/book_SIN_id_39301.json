    "word": "Laborers Together With God.--If good men and humble men will take up their duty just where it is, to help those who are ready to die, they will be a great blessing to the church. There are unconverted men in the church, and if those who are so longing to show their zeal for the Lord will seek these poor souls and work with patience and perseverance to win them to Jesus, God would work with them. \"We are labourers together with God\" (1 Corinthians 3:9), not to tear down and destroy, but to restore. \"Make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way\" (Hebrews 12:13). There is an abundance of work that is needed to be done in home missions, and in exercising the talents God has given us, for wise improvement. We may become skillful as a tradesman in His business \n                                                                           357\nby practice. We want to become skillful in the trade of working to bless souls, learning to save souls. This requires prayer, and earnest, persevering effort, and a willingness to work in a humble way.",
