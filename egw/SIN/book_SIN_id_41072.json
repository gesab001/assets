    "word": "Riding Out in the Country: \n     I was weak as a child after bearing the plain testimony and felt unable to write. W. C. White saw my condition and he hired a team, and I rode out for the first time in four weeks. We rode several miles in the country and were much pleased with the city grounds and forests that were open to the poor and to all who wished to go out in the country. These extensive grounds are reserved for the city that they may have places near by to take their children. This is a blessing.",
