    "word": "Let business men or women do business in a way that will glorify their Master because of their fidelity. Let them carry their religion into everything that is done and reveal to others the Spirit of Christ. Let the mechanic be a diligent and faithful representative of Him who toiled in the lowly walks of life in the cities of Judea. Let everyone who names the name of Christ so work, that others by seeing their good works may be led to glorify their Creator and Redeemer. \u201cWhatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord.\u201d Let the upbuilding of the kingdom of Christ be your constant thought, and let every effort be directed toward this one end.",
