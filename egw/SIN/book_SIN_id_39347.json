    "word": "How abundant is the gift to our world of the Holy Spirit! It is beyond the power of language to express the blessings it brings to God's people. If received and appreciated, the Holy Spirit will make us holy, Christlike. Through its agency we are united with Christ, partakers of the divine nature. The reception of the Holy Spirit in its fullness is the great need of the church today.--Letter 178, 1907, p. 3. (To J. E. White, May 17, 1907.)",
