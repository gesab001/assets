    "word": "The matters that have been so perplexing will be adjusted by the Lord. My brethren, you are not to turn out of office the ones whose work God has accepted, even if in your judgment they have made some mistakes. Meddle not with matters that you do not comprehend because you have not passed over the ground. Some of you have a wrong conception of many things. Do you not see that you are ceasing to follow in the way of the Lord? You are deviating from the path of duty appointed you. Guard well your own souls. Do the work that God had given you. Leave His appointed workers with Him. Your unconsecrated movements have been placed upon others very heavy burdens, and have made necessary the expenditure of much time and money in order to settle matters that would have adjusted themselves if meddlesome minds had not placed the worst possible construction upon the transactions that they could make appear in a false light.",
