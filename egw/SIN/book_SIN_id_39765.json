    "word": "I remember the rest that I enjoyed last summer on The Morning Star. At the Berrien Springs meeting I had carried a heavy burden, and for several nights had been unable to sleep. With Brethren Magan and Sutherland and W. C. White, I accepted your invitation to take a trip up the river in your boat, looking for land suitable for a school location. I remember the many precious seasons of prayer we had together while on this trip. Soon I was able to sleep at night, and felt free from all symptoms of nervous prostration. This rest was a great blessing to me. . . .",
