    "word": "The preacher spices his discourses with humorous remarks, presenting the truth in a ludicrous manner and misrepresenting those who believe it. These amusing presentations please the audience, and ridicule serves to banish conviction from many minds. Often the teacher has no real knowledge of the subject he is treating upon, but the hearers accept his statements without bringing them to the test of Scripture, and think that now they are released from the cross of obeying the truth, they can have peace.",
