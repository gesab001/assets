    "word": "Cedars of the Vale \n     Though your Christian brother may not occupy a position equal to yours in prominence, yet he fills a place of usefulness according to his ability. God has come very near you, guiding you and holding your hand. This should lead you to show Christian courtesy in all business matters. You are to be a man of God's opportunity, acting in His place. You, a cedar of the mountain, are to remember that God has cedars of the vale.--Letter 112, 1901.",
