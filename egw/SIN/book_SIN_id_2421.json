    "word": "Credit Others With Some Sense--I have been shown that there is one practice which those in responsible places should avoid; for it is detrimental to the work of God.  Men in position should not lord it over God's heritage and command everything around them.  Too many have marked out a prescribed one which they wish others to follow in the work.  Workers have tried to do this with blind faith, without exercising their own judgment upon the matter which they had in hand.  If those who were placed as directors were not present, they have followed their implicit directions just the same.  But in the name of Christ, I would entreat you to stop this work.  Give men a chance to exercise their individual judgment.",
