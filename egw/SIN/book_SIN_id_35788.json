    "word": "When the Holy Spirit works through the human agents, exercising its consecrating influence, they will not seek to evade his obligations in regard to the souls perishing around them. Sin and iniquity will not go unrebuked, however important the personage may be who ventures to sin. Benevolence will be more common. There will be no limit to its plans for the salvation of souls.",
