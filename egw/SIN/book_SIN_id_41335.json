    "word": "My brother, I tell you that which God has opened before me. Satan is seeking to lead you and your brothers to make shipwreck of the faith; he desires you to place yourself where you will recklessly disregard the sanctifying truth which would perfect a Christian character in you. Do not surrender principles, and you will be safe. You have erred, but there is a remedy for you; if you repent of your sins, and forsake them, and believe in Jesus Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour His blood will cleanse you from all sin.",
