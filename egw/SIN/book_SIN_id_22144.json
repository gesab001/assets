    "word": "2, 3. A Picture That Will Subdue and Humble.--Prophecy foretold that Christ was to appear as a root out of dry ground. \"He hath no form nor comeliness,\" wrote Isaiah, \"and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.\" This chapter should be studied. It presents Christ as the Lamb of God. Those who are lifted up with pride, whose souls are filled with vanity, should look upon this picture of their Redeemer, and humble themselves in the dust. The entire chapter should be committed to memory. Its influence will subdue and humble the soul defiled by sin and uplifted by self-exaltation.",
