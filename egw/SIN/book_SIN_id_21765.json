WHITE \n     AT SANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA, MARCH 7, 1885.] \n\n\n     Says John, in speaking of the deceiver that doeth great wonders: He shall make an image to the beast, and shall cause all to receive his mark. Will you please to consider this matter? Search the Scriptures, and see. There is a wonder-working power to appear: and it will be when men are claiming sanctification, and holiness, lifting themselves up higher and higher and boasting of themselves.",
