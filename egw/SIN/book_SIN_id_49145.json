    "word": "To Brother Rogers, who is to take charge of the Huntsville School, I would say, Look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of your faith. You will have provocations, but do not lose your patience and your self-control. Do not allow yourself to be easily provoked. I am sure that you are in the right place, and I ask you to work with an eye single to the glory of God.",
