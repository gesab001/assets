    "word": "If Jesus were made the sum and substance of every discourse, sinners would be convicted. By the message borne they would know what they must do to be saved. Lift him up, the Man of Calvary, higher and still higher. Who can declare the glory of the incarnate God? What language can describe it? It is not the men learned in this world's wisdom who have true eloquence. True eloquence is possessed only by those who have tasted of the love of Christ. The life renewed by divine grace and hidden with Christ in God is eloquent in its simplicity.",
