    "word": "Christ has warned us against the pride of life, but not against its grace and natural beauty. He pointed to the flowers of the field, to the lily unfolding in its purity, and said, \"Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\" Matthew 6:29. Thus by the things of nature, Christ illustrates the beauty that heaven values, the modest grace, the simplicity, the purity, the appropriateness, that would make our attire pleasing to Him. The most beautiful dress He bids us wear upon the soul. No outward adorning can compare in value or loveliness with that \"meek and quiet spirit\" which in His sight is \"of great price.\" 1 Peter 3:4. . . .",
