    "word": "Christ knew that His Father had chosen Him to carry out the great plan of redemption by coming to the fallen world to die for sinners. And when He came to fulfill His mission, He was, in every sense of the term, a medical missionary. Those who yoke up with Him and learn of Him, will also be true medical missionaries. Receiving the Spirit of Christ, every one of His followers will fulfill a divinely appointed mission not merely to be an influence among influences, but to be an influence for God in every sense of the term.",
