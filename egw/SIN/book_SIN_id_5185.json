    "word": "The wrath of God will fall upon those who have served mammon instead of their Creator. But those who live for God and heaven, pointing out the way of life to others, will find that the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. And they will hear by and by the welcome invitation, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" The joy of Christ was that of seeing souls saved in His glorious kingdom; and for this joy He \"endured the cross, despising the shame.\" But soon \"He shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied.\" How happy will those be, who, having shared in His work, are permitted to share in His joy!--R. & H., June 23, 1885.",
