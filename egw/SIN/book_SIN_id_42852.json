    "word": "Faith is yours to exercise as the gift of God. You need not fluctuate between hope and fear and despondency. Be assured that as you approach God, you will as surely know that He is drawing nigh unto you, to nourish, and encourage, and enrich your soul. Trust the Lord as if the blessing were already in your possession. \"If any of you lack wisdom,\" He says, \"let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord\" [James 1:5-7].",
