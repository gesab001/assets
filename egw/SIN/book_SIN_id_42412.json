    "word": "My brother, my sister, the Lord has greatly blessed you both. Your cheerful, happy temperament will be a medicine. Have faith in God. Move, step by step, onward and upward. And as you associate with the patients and minister to them by imparting God's word of comfort and hope, may the words of truth be to them as a leaf from the tree of life. Lead them on to have faith in Jesus Christ. Thus many souls will decide to count the cost of their sinful indulgence of intemperate habits and sensual propensities--indulgence that, if continued, would prove the ruin of soul as well as of body.",
