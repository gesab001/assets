I wish to say that I cannot ask the Conference to invest in a sanitarium at Redlands. They have enough responsibilities to carry without taking upon them others. If you in Los Angeles will do your best, we will do our best. If you will do nothing, say so, and we will do nothing. If you will work intelligently, as we know you can, then we will do what we can. But if you do nothing, waiting for the Conference you will lose your chances. If you are going to depend on the Conference purchasing it, I have no hope of your obtaining it.",
