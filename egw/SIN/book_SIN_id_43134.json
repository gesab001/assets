    "word": "God would have His people love one another and help one another, thus strengthening every good work. We should counsel with one another, the old, experienced laborers with those whom God shall raise up to advance His work as we approach the great consummation. But if such men as Elder Smith, Elder Van Horn, and Elder Butler shall stand aloof, not blending with the elements God sees essential to carry forward the work in these perilous times, they will be left behind. God will complete His work in righteousness. These brethren have had every opportunity to stand in the ranks that are pressing on to victory, but if they refuse, the work will advance without them.",
