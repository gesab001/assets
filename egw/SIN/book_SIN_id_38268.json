    "word": "When the Lord moves upon the churches, bidding them to do a certain work, and they refuse to do that work; and when some with their human efforts united with the divine endeavor to reach to the very depths of human woe and misery. God's blessing will rest richly upon them. Even though but few souls accept the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, their work will not be in vain; for one soul is precious, very precious, in the eyes of God. Christ died for that soul, in order that he might live through eternal ages.",
