    "word": "Business matters should be attended to by those specially appointed for this work, and, so far as possible, they should be brought before the people at some other time than the camp-meeting. Instruction in canvassing, in Sabbath-school work, and in the details of tract and missionary work, should be given in the home churches or in meetings specially appointed. The same principle applies to cooking-schools. While these are right in their place, they should not occupy the time at the camp-meeting.",
