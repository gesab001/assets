Every means possible is to be used to arouse those who claim to believe in Christ yet do not keep the commandments of God. The medical missionary work is to be so conducted that it will maintain a holy, exalted standard, moving steadily onward and upward, presenting God's claims to those who have never heard the truth for this time. Medical missionary work is to be to the third angel's message as the right hand to the body, increasing its usefulness and efficiency.",
