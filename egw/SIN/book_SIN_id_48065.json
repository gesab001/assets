    "word": "Our medical missionary work is to be to the third angel's message as the right hand to the body. Our sanitariums are one great means of doing medical missionary work. They are to reach the people where they are. The workers in our sanitariums are to be sympathetic, kind, and straightforward in their dealings with one another and with the patients. Their words and acts are to be noble and upright. They are ever to receive from Christ light and grace to impart to those in darkness. (130b) By their efforts the sick, the sinful, the prodigals, who have left the Father's house, are to be encouraged to return. God's words to these workers is, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end.\" \"Fear not, neither be discouraged; for I am thy God.\"",
