    "word": "It is through the Son of God that we claim the promises that He has left on record for us. Here we have come out, and are keeping His commandments, because we see it is His requirement. We make ourselves peculiar from the world in this respect; and as we follow the best light we have in keeping His commandments, it is our privilege to claim His blessing, and then lay your whole burden upon Jesus Christ and claim by faith His rich salvation. While Satan will press upon your soul his darkness and tell you [that] you cannot be saved, tell him, \"Jesus died for me; it was a whole sacrifice that was made in my behalf, and I claim a whole salvation. The Master would have me joyful, for He has said it (John 15). The Word of God declares plainly and positively, 'Herein is My Father \n\n\n                                     -45- \n\nglorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples. . . . These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.'\"",
