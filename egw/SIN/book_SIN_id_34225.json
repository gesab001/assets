    "word": "The doing of the law of God is the fruit of His grace in the heart. Obeying this law, we daily remember that God is the giver of all that we hold in trust. He provides us with all we have. It is because of His mercy and love that we have strength to labor. He opens ways by which we may gain earthly treasure, not that self may be exalted, not that the treasure obtained may be hoarded up, but that God's name may be glorified, that the needy may be helped, that God's treasury may be provided with that which He claims in gifts and offerings, that the work of raising the standard of truth in the regions beyond may not languish, but move forward and upward.",
