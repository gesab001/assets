Olsen, \n\n\n      Battle Creek, Michigan, U.S.A., \n\nMy dear brother:- \n     It has been revealed to me that the Lord proves and tries all who have named the name of Christ, but especially those who are stewards on any department of his cause. A connection with the special work of God for this time brings with it much responsibility, and the higher the position of trust, the greater the responsibility attached to it. How humble and sincere the one needs to be who is filling such a position! How fearful and mistrustful of himself! How careful to give all the praise and thanksgiving to God!",
