    "word": "The Lord has given us precious blessings in the simple flowers of the field, in the fragrance so grateful to our senses.  He has tinted every flower with beauty; for He is the great Master Artist.  He who has created the beautiful things in nature will do far greater things for the soul.  God is a lover of the beautiful, and He would adorn our characters with His own rich graces.  He would have our words as fragrant as the flowers of the field.  He has given us blessings in daily provision for our physical needs.  The very bread we are has upon it the image and superscription of the cross.",
