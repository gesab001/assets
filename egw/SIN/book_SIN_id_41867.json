    "word": "God says to every man to whom He entrusts responsibilities, \"Put not your trust in man, neither make flesh your arm.\" Look to God. Trust in His infallible wisdom. Regard as a sin the practice so common, even among Seventh-day Adventists, of becoming the echo of any man, however lofty his position. Listen to the voice of the great Shepherd, and you will never be led astray. Search the Scriptures for yourself and be braced for duty and for trial by the truth of God's Word.",
