    "word": "Bro. George Lay: I was shown your case. You occupy a responsible position. You are entrusted with talents of money, and talents of influence. To every man there is given a work. Something to do, not merely to engage his brain, bone and muscle in common labor; it means more than this. You are acquainted with this work from a worldly point of view, and have some experience in the work in a religious capacity. But for a few years past you have been losing time, \n                                                                           42\nand now you will have to work fast to redeem the past. To possess talents is not enough; you must turn these talents to advantage; not merely for yourself, but for Him who bestowed them. All that you have is a loan from your Lord. He will require it again at your hand with interest.",
