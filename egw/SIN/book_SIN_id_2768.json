    "word": "Of how little value are gold or pearls or costly array, when compared with the meekness and loveliness of Christ! Physical loveliness consists in symmetry \u2014 the harmonious proportion of parts; but spiritual loveliness consists in harmony with Christ \u2014 the likeness of our souls to him. The grace of Christ is indeed a priceless adornment. It elevates and ennobles the possessor; and it also has an influence upon others, attracting them to the Source of light and blessing.",
