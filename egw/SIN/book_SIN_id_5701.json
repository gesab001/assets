    "word": "The Health-Food Work \n\n     The health-food business should be established here [Avondale]. It should be one of the industries connected with the school. God has instructed me that parents can find work in this industry, and send their children to school. But everything that is done should be done with the greatest simplicity. There is to be no extravagance in anything. Solid work is to be done, because, unless the work is done solidly, a slipshod experience is the result.--Australasian Union Conference Record, July 28, 1899.",
