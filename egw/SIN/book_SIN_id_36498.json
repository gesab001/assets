    "word": "The Church Must Be Quickened. \n\n     \"Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.\" This is a time when every member of the church should be waiting, and watching, and working. Through faith in Jesus Christ, we should be alive unto God; and every man, woman, and child who has a knowledge of the truth, should be able to discern the signs for the times. The weakness and inefficiency of the church must pass away. Creative power from above must impart life to the human agents whom God would use, that they may be able to cooperate with divine intelligences. The church to whom God has imparted his endowment of heavenly truth, must not remain dead in trespasses and sins.",
