    "word": "I wish to write a few things to you. Brother Hull has just come in to inquire in regard to his studying to be a physician. He is conversing with \n\n\n                                     -394- \n\nyour father while I am writing. I felt pained. He has proved himself worthy of encouragement to commence study. The position I believe the Lord desired you to fill, but we could not, dared not, encourage you to study, for you have shown such weakness to resist temptation. We feared to put you to any test to prove you in so important a position, for you had shown you had no strength to endure the test in smaller matters. . . .",
