    "word": "That evening the burden left us. It was rolled upon the brethren and sisters of Waukon, and they labored for each other with zeal and with the power of God upon them. Countenances that looked sad when we came to the place, now shone with the heavenly anointing. It seemed that heavenly angels were passing from one to another in the room to finish the good work which had begun. Soon we were able to bid farewell to our brethren in Waukon, and to start on our homeward journey.",
