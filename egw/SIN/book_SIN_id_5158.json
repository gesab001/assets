    "word": "There are many who in their hearts charge God with being a hard master because He claims their possessions and their service. But we can bring to God nothing that is not already His. \"All things come of Thee,\" said King David, \"and of Thine own have we given Thee.\" All things are God's, not only by creation, but by redemption. All the blessings of this life and of the life to come are delivered to us stamped with the cross of Calvary.--R. & H., Dec. 23, 1902.",
