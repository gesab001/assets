    "word": "As we heard the sounds of mirth and revelry that seemed to come from the abyss below, we shuddered. We heard the profane oath, the vulgar jest, and low, vile songs. We heard the war song and the dance song.

Much of the time we were compelled to suspend our whole weight upon the cords, which increased in size as we progressed.",
