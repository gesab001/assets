Many souls were charmed with the light shining forth from the Word of God. Some points were presented which were not in accordance with the manner in which our brethren had interpreted the two laws, and they seemed to deplore greatly that this, to them, inharmonious note should be struck, because it created strong feelings of opposition, for the ideas were not in accordance with their former views of the two laws.",
