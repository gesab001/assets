    "word": "Brethren in present truth should let these uncertain enterprises [investing in patent rights] alone. Seek some steady employment, even if the income is small, and do not be given to much change. Many of our brethren involve themselves by engaging in patent rights which look promising to them; but after they are caught in the snare they find themselves disappointed, and their means gone--means which should have been used to support their family and advance the cause of present truth. Then come remorse, self-reproach, and regret, and some conscientious ones cast away their confidence and lose their spiritual enjoyment, and in consequence their health.--Letter 9, 1863, to an early Advent believer.",
