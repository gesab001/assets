    "word": "I saw that some expected to overcome alone by the blood of the Lamb, without making any special effort of their own. I saw that God had been merciful in giving us the power of speech. He has given us tongue and utterance, and we are accountable to Him for it, and we should glorify God with our mouths, speaking in favor of Him and His truth. We should overcome by the word of our testimony through the blood of the Lamb. I saw that they did not come together to sit still, and look at each other. But those were remembered of God who came together to honor and glorify Him, to speak of His glory and talk of His power. Such ones would be remembered and blessings from God would rest upon them and they would be refreshed. If all moved as I saw they should, no precious time would run to waste. No reproofs would be needed, or called for about long prayers and testimonies, for all the time would be occupied by short, sweet, testimonies and prayers, that were to the point. Ask, believe, and receive. There is too much mocking God, too much praying that is no praying and that wearies angels and that displeases God. Too many vain unmeaning petitions. \n\n\n                                     -425-",
