    "word": "Sanctified knowledge is power, life, peace, and joy forever. If you had all your powers under the control of the Spirit of God, you could be a blessing to others, but as you are you simply bring in confusion and heresy. Every effort you make to lead souls into the truth is fruitless because you bring up your daughter's spurious visions, comparing them with Sister White's, and thus lead souls to believe a lie. Satan can speak some truth \n\n\n                                    -118- \n\nto those he wishes to deceive, as he did to Christ. He can so interweave truth with falsehood that the truth will be of none effect. . . .",
