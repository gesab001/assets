    "word": "I am instructed to bring these things before you, pressing them upon your attention, that, if possible, you may be led to lay hold upon the hope set before you in the gospel. By your schemes and your consultations with lawyers, you are divorcing yourself from your only hope. What shall if profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Heaven and earth shall pass away, but God's word will never pass away. Not one jot or tittle of his holy law \n\n\n                            -121- \n\nwill ever pass away. Not all the power on earth, of men in the highest positions, or of devils, can make void the words of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
