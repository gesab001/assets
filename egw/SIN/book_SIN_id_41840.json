    "word": "Letters of inquiry are coming to us asking, \"Has Sister White changed? Does she now favor the re-establishment of a college in Battle Creek?\" In the past I have given the word of the Lord in regard to the removal of the school from Battle Creek, and I have not changed. If anyone is determined to place himself in a position where he counterworks the work of God, we are to leave that one with the Lord. I am to have no controversy with him. But such a man must not be allowed to call the most promising young people away from positions that they can fill in the Lord's work, to a place from which the Lord has declared that His people are to move.",
