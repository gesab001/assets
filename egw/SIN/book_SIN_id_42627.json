    "word": "MR No. 1065 - The Avondale Property Ideal for Cultivation and Education\n\n            (Written at Cooranbong, N.S.W., August 27, 1894.) \n\n     Emily, May, and myself drove four miles in a two-wheeled trap, which was drawn by a large horse. We went in search of oranges, which grow in this locality without receiving cultivation. This soil produces the best oranges we have eaten since coming to this country. They are not as sour as those we have procured in Granville and in other localities. They are very nice when picked from the tree and eaten fresh. They are juicy and refreshing. We paid three pence, or six cents in American money, per dozen.",
