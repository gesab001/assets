I do not wish to ignore or drop one link in the chain of evidence that was formed as, after the passing of the time in 1844, little companies of seekers after truth met together to study the Bible and to ask God for light and guidance. As we searched the Scriptures with much prayer, many evidences were given us under the manifestation of the Holy Spirit's power. What deep importance was attached to every evidence that God gave us! The truth, point by point, was fastened in our minds so firmly that we could not doubt.",
