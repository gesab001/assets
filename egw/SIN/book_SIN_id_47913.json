    "word": "When attending the meeting at Parramatta, I was in the night season passing through some exciting scenes in Africa. There were laid out some formulated arrangements and plans which were presented for acceptance; but Elder Daniells did not feel prepared to accept these plans, because they had in them some things which meant more than all could see. And while some would have accepted them, Eld. Daniells said, \"I cannot subscribe my name to them.\" This refusal greatly disappointed the framers of the articles of agreement. But no one who has had an experience in the rise and progress of the cause of God would without special advice from the Source of all wisdom concede to the terms of agreement or bind themselves to the conditions laid down, which the Lord could not favor.",
