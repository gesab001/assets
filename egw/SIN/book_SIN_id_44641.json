    "word": "Parents are to do all in their power to keep disagreements out of the home circle. If the children quarrel, they should be reminded that God has said, \"Let not the sun go down on your wrath.\" Teach them never to let the sun go down on unpleasant, angry feelings, or on a sin unconfessed. Teach them that harmony must reign in the home, even as it reigns in the heavenly courts. The family on earth is to be the symbol of the family in heaven.",
