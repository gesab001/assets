    "word": "When the message comes to those who have not heard the truth for this time, they see that a great reformation must take place in their diet. They see that they must put away flesh-food, because it creates an appetite for liquor, and fills the system with disease. By meat-eating, the physical, mental, and moral powers are weakened. Man is built up from that which he eats. Animal passions bear sway as the result of meat-eating, tobacco-using, and liquor-drinking. The Lord will give His people wisdom to prepare from that which the earth yields, foods that will take the place of flesh-meat. Simple combinations of nuts and grains and fruits, manufactured with taste and skill, will commend themselves to unbelievers. But as a usual thing, too many nuts are used in the combinations made. -MS 156, 1901. Written November 27, 1901.",
