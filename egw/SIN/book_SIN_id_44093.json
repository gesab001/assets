    "word": "I do not know what called out these remarks, only the thought that many will look away from present duties, present comfort and blessings, and be borrowing trouble in regard to the future crisis. This will be making a time of trouble beforehand, and we will receive no grace for any such anticipated troubles. Rejoice in God always. Today praise God for His grace, and continue to praise Him every day. When the scene of sore conflict comes, we have learned the lesson of holy confidence, of blessed trust, and we place our hands in the hands of Christ, our feet on the Rock of Ages, and we are secure from storm, from tempest. We are to wait on our Lord. Jesus will be an ever present help in every time of need. We may be glad in the Lord. We may show forth the praises of Him who hath called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. My meditation of Him shall be sweet--of Him to whom I have committed the keeping of my soul.",
