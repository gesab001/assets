    "word": "I did not get free from cold while I was there, and it continued its hold on me all the way home. I went to Battle Creek, as you know, and spoke \n\n\n                                  -225- \n\ntwice to the patients and once in the gymnasium to the nurses and helpers. I would have been very glad, could I have felt free to remain another week in Battle Creek. I would have done this, but Marian's [Davis] sickness called me home. Her case was a heavy weight on my mind. We received letters every day telling us of her increasing weakness. The thought that I must part with her was a great trial to me. She had been with me for 25 years, and we blended nicely in our work. I knew that if she should die I could not find another to supply her place. Our ideas in regard to the work were one, and we often talked together. Every word that I spoke to make a point clearer, she would write out at once.",
