    "word": "I would love to see you before you go to Europe but I do not expect to see you. I have given you to God. You and Mary are very dear to me but you both belong to God. I would not hedge up your way for an instant to gratify \n\n\n                                   -182- \n\nmy motherly feelings. God gave His dear Son to die for sinful man and shall I let selfish feelings come in? No, no, I never expect to look upon your faces again until I meet you around the great white throne. Not a murmur is in my heart. I feel that God has been good to me. He has honored me in giving me children that He can use in His work to advance His cause. This is the greatest blessing that a mother can have, to know that her children are striving in every direction to benefit man and glorify God. These words are expressive of my feelings: \n               \"Do something, do it soon with all thy might; \n                    An angel's wing would droop if long at rest, \n               And God Himself, inactive were no longer blest.\" --Letter 36, 1878, p. 1. (To \"Dear Willie\" [W. C. White], June 28, 1878.)",
