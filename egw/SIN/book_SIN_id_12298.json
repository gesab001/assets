    "word": "God designed that the temple at Jerusalem should be a continual witness to the high destiny open to every soul. But the Jews had not understood the significance of the building they regarded with so much pride. . . . The courts of the temple at Jerusalem, filled with the tumult of unholy traffic, represented all too truly the temple of the heart, defiled by the presence of sensual passion and unholy thoughts. In cleansing the Temple from the world's buyers and sellers, Jesus announced His mission to cleanse the heart from the defilement of sin --from the earthly desires, the selfish lusts, the evil habits that corrupt the soul. . . . Only Christ can cleanse the soul temple. . . . His presence will cleanse and sanctify the soul, so that it may be a holy temple unto the Lord, and \"an habitation of God through the Spirit\" (Ephesians 2:22).",
