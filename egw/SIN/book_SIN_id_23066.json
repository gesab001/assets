    "word": "In the midst of the tumult the apostle remained calm and self-possessed. His mind was stayed upon God, and he knew that angels of Heaven were about him. He could not leave the temple without making an effort to set the truth before his countrymen. He therefore turned to the commanding officer, and in a deferential manner addressed him in Greek, saying, \"May I speak with thee?\" In astonishment Lysias inquired if he was indeed mistaken in supposing the prisoner to have been the ring-leader of a band of robbers and murderers in the late rebellion. In reply, Paul declared that he was no Egyptian, but a Jew of \"Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city,\" and begged that he might be permitted to speak to the people. The Lord had given his servant an influence over the Roman officer, and the request was granted.",
