    "word": "We point you to the mansions Christ is preparing for all those who love Him. We point you to that city that hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. We show you its massive walls, with the twelve foundations, and tell you that these walls must be scaled. You look discouraged at the magnitude of the work before you. We point you to the ladder set up on earth, reaching to the city of God. Plant your feet on the ladder. Forsake your sins. Climb step by step and you will reach God above the ladder, and the Holy City of God. None who will resolutely mount up on the ladder will fail of everlasting life. \"For \n\n\n                                    -355- \n\nso an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\"--Ms 13, 1884. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Sept. 8, 1988. Entire Ms.",
