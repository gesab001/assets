Pulmonary diseases, cancers, and tumors, are startlingly common among animals. It is true that the inspectors rejected many of the cattle that were thus diseased, but many were passed on to the market that ought to have been refused. Inspectors and herdsmen, I am told, have entered into confederacy in this matter. Some inspectors say, \"This herd or this flock will pass. Leave me this or that sheep, or this or that steer.\" Thus unwholesome flesh has gone on to the markets for human consumption. In many localities even fish is unwholesome, and ought not to be used. This is especially so where fish come in contact with the sewerage of large cities. We seldom have any fish upon our table. The fish that partake of the filthy sewerage of the drains may pass into waters far distant from the sewerage, and be caught in localities where the water is pure and fresh, but because of the unwholesome drainage in which they have been feeding, they are not safe to eat.",
