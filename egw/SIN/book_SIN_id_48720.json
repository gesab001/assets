    "word": "Christ left the courts of Heaven, laid aside His kingly crown and royal robe, and came to live the life of the poor. He subjected Himself to all the temptations common to humanity, that man might look upon the Prince of Heaven, and see in Him a perfect exhibition of the conquest of sin. In all trials and temptations and trials Christ sinned not, neither was guile found in His mouth. He clothed His divinity with humanity, but in His teaching and ministry His divinity was clearly manifest.",
