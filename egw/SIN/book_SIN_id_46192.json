    "word": "Jesus saves only those who repent of their sins. By the efficacy of His blood, they are cleansed from all defilements. In all wisdom and prudence He works in the one who in faith surrenders to Him. \"Let him take hold of My strength,\" He says, \"that he may make peace with Me, and he shall make peace with Me.\" All those who die to self He will make vessels unto honor. He will bestow on them wisdom and understanding in spiritual things, giving them a rich measure of His grace.",
