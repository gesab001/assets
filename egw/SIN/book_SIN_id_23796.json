    "word": "In the days of Christ, the religious instruction of the young was thought to be so important that the town or city which did not provide schools for this purpose, was regarded as under the curse of God. Yet in both the school and the home, the teaching had become mechanical and formal. Since \"in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren\" (Hebrews 2:17), and Jesus gained knowledge as we may do, the intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures, which he evinced in his ministry, testifies to the diligence with which, in those early years, he gave himself to the study of the sacred word.",
