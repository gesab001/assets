    "word": "-109- \n\n     That is why Paul and Silas were thrown into prison. The universe of heaven knew all about it. These men were singing praises to God. It was a new note the jailers heard. They were laid upon their backs, and their feet put in the stocks, and yet they touched a new note. Heaven's army approaches, and to their tread earth begins to quake. The jailer knew that those who kept the prison when Peter escaped were put to death. As the doors opened Paul did not say to the frightened jailer that it would be good enough for him to be put to death, but he did say, \"Do thyself no harm.\" Then the jailer comes in and acknowledges the power of God and asks forgiveness for his cruelty and says, \"What must I do to be saved?\" He gives himself to God, washes the backs of Paul and Silas, and puts them in as comfortable a position as possible.",
