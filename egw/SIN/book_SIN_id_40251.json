    "word": "All the congregations in our land need to learn more of Christ and Him crucified. A religious experience that is not founded in Christ and Him alone is worthless. These men of intellectual powers need a clear, scriptural presentation of the plan of salvation. Let the truth in its simplicity and power be presented to them. If this does not hold the attention and arouse the interest, they never can be interested in heavenly and divine things. In every congregation there are souls who are unsatisfied. Every Sabbath they want to hear something definite explaining how they can be saved, how they are to become Christians. The important thing for them to know is, How can a sinner be justified before God? Let the \n\n\n                                   -162- \n\nway of salvation be presented before them in simplicity, just as plainly as you would speak to a little child, Lift up Jesus as the sinner's only hope.--Letter 23a, 1893, pp. 9, 10. (To Brother E. H. Gates, January 10, 1893.)",
