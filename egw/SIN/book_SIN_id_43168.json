    "word": "Brother Baker read to us Brother Palmer's proposition to come to Cooranbong to hold a canvassing institute. But this is not a favorable time. The meetinghouse, if it is finished, will require all our thought and all our time. The students have all they can carry in their program of study and work, and Brother Palmer would be disappointed in the work he \n\n\n                                  -343- \n\nwishes to see accomplished. Those who attend camp meeting will have to work most earnestly, preparing to move to the point of interest in Sydney. The people here will have all they can possibly do to prepare for the meeting. Therefore this would not be a favorable time for Brother Palmer's efforts to tell to the best account. Those in his class could not retain the instruction they would need to have. On the campground he can have his class, which will embrace more than those in the school who wish to enter the canvassing field. Many more will be benefited by having the class in Sydney than here.",
