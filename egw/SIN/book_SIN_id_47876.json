    "word": "I have been forced to inquire why several of our canvassers in this field, who were canvassing for the Home Hand Book, have left the field having only paid their expenses. Some did not even do this. They stated that when the time came for them to deliver their books, they could not obtain copies to deliver. They were themselves greatly disappointed, and the people who were expecting the book were also disappointed. What shall we do about this? I have talked to the men in the Echo Office about it, and they say that they cannot obtain copies of The Home Hand Book.",
