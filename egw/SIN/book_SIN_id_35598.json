    "word": "Feb. 2, 1895. \n\n                Activity in Our Churches. \n\n\n     The prevailing monotony of the religious round of service in our churches, needs to be disturbed. The leaven of activity needs to be introduced, that our church members may work along new lines, and devise new methods. The Holy Spirit's power will move upon hearts when this dead, lifeless monotony is broken up, and many will begin to work in earnest who never before thought of being anything but idle spectators. A working church on earth is connected with the working church above. God works, angels work, and men should work, for the conversion of souls. Efforts should be made to do something while the day lasts, and the grace of God will be revealed that souls may be saved to Christ. Everywhere souls are perishing in their sins, and God is saying to every believing soul, \"Hasten to their help with the message that I shall give you.\"",
