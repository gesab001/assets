    "word": "There are ministers who have stood on Satan's side of this question, as men who do not desire to become interested in the work for the South. To those who were inclined to send help to the work in Nashville, they have talked their own unbelief so discouragingly that this place, which God has said plainly should have special advantages, has not received the help that it should have received. Over and over again, money that has been given to this field has been diverted into other channels. Thus is being repeated the mistake in the past in regard to the misappropriation of means. There are those who, instead of strengthening and sustaining the work in Nashville, have tried to tear it down by unjust criticism and evil surmisings. They have placed a mole close to the eye, and it has become to them a mountain. Nothing but it can they see. If they would remove this mole, as they could if they so desired, they would see the glory beyond. But will they do this, which would be an act of such mercy to themselves? They can not see the way in which the Lord regards their present attitude. They are picking at straws. They need not be as they are. Their condition depends on themselves. But they must submit to the will of God. Until they do this, the words spoken of Moab are applicable to them: \"Moab. . . hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel; therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.\"",
