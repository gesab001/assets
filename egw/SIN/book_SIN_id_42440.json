    "word": "Brother and Sister_____, do you not affront others by this spirit? Do you not let harsh words of retaliation come when you would better be silent? Do you not do things that wound and bruise and irritate the spirit? Do you not create an atmosphere about you which is as poisonous spiritual malaria? Why not remember how much you have to be grateful for? Jesus is still interceding in your behalf, but in a short time He will arise and put on His garments of vengeance. Then there will be no more sacrifice for sin, no more pardon. Every soul will remain either holy or sinful, for no more will the atoning blood be offered.",
