    "word": "It was not over a year, before James White talked it over with me. He said something had come up, and he should have to go away and leave me to go with whomsoever I would, or we must be married. He said something had got to be done. So we were married, and have been married ever since. Although he is dead, I feel that he is the best man that ever trod shoe leather.--Document File 733c, pp. 8, 10, 11. (Interview with Mrs. E. G. White, regarding early experiences.) \n\nReleased September 15, 1972.",
