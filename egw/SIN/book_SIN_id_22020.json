David Reproved for Walking in Own Counsel.--[1 Kings 3:14 quoted.] Several times during his reign David walked in the counsel of his own heart, and greatly injured his influence by following his impulses. But he always received the words of reproof sent to him by the Lord. These words cut him to the quick. He did not seek to evade the matter, but bore the punishment of his transgression, saying, \"I have sinned\" (MS 164, 1902).",
