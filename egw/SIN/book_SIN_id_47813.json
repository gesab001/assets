    "word": "Notwithstanding all the light shinning forth from the Scriptures on this subject: notwithstanding the lessons given in the history of Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego: notwithstanding the result of plain healthful diet, there is little regard for the lessons penned by men inspired of God. The dietetic habits of the people generally are neglected; there is an increase of tobacco using, liquor drinking, and subsisting on flesh meats. I see young boys here in this locality, bright-looking, intelligent youth, from ten to twelve years of age, following the example of their fathers. His habits and practices are educating his children to do as he does. When going to Cooranbong a few days since, two lads were sitting in a tram before me. They were about ten or eleven years of age. One was smoking a cigarette. He would use the vile, poisonous little roll of paper, then the other would take the same in his mouth and enjoy the luxury. Physical and moral ruin is seen everywhere. The question is asked, Have I not a right to do as I please with my own body?-- No; you have no moral right, because you are violating the laws of life and health which God has given you. You are the Lord's property--His by creation and His by redemption. \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" The law of self-respect, for the property of the Lord is here brought to view. And this will lead to respect for the obligations which every human being is under to preserve the living machinery that is so fearfully and wonderfully made. This living machinery is to be understood. Every part of its wonderful mechanism is to be carefully studied. Self-preservation is to be practiced.",
