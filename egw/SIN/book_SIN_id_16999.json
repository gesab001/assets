    "word": "God\u2019s promise is, \u201cYe shall be holy; for I am holy.\u201d Holiness is the reflection of God\u2019s glory. But in order to reflect this glory, we must cooperate with God. Heart and mind must be emptied of all that leads to wrong. The Word of God must be read and studied with a sincere desire to gain from it spiritual strength. This Word is the Bread of heaven. Those who receive it, and make it a part of their lives, grow strong in the strength of God. Our sanctification is God\u2019s object in all His dealing with us. He has chosen us from eternity, that we may be holy. Christ declares, \u201cThis is the will of God, even your sanctification.\u201d Is it your will, also, that your desires and inclinations shall be brought into conformity to the divine will? . . .",
