    "word": "Christ came to our world to counterwork sin. God has given his only begotten Son to die for sinners. He \"so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" \"Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save, neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear. But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.\" \"Their web shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; \n                                                                           1659\nwasting and destruction are in their paths.
