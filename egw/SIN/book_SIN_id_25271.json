    "word": "Often did this oppressed brother come from Milton to Saratoga to ask our advice as to the course he should pursue. Said he, \"They say this heavy weight about my heart is because God frowns upon me, because I do not sell.\" He said he had ready means to use wherever the Lord called. We told him not to sink in discouragement, that if it was his duty to sell, the Lord was as willing to let him know it, and feel the burden, as to teach it to his brethren. Once he came, dizzy and distressed, having become nearly blind on the way. We felt sure his distress was in consequence of disease of the heart, and told him so; that it was not because of neglected duty, for he was willing to do anything.",
