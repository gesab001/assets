    "word": "God's servants, who have had great light and blessing from Him, are not to be like a blast of hail, on any occasion, to beat down and destroy.

And Christ's ambassadors must learn the lesson that sharp speeches and word-thrusts bring no victory. \n\n\n                                  -316-",
