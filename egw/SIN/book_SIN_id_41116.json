    "word": "The eldest has been searching the Scriptures for some time, anxious, troubled, and convicted. He is afflicted with heart-trouble, and came to the Health Retreat for treatment. He had over-worked his brain, and his mind found no rest, no peace. He came to see me. Willie and I talked with him. He feared that he had resisted the truth, and that the Lord had given him up to his own way. We had a most solemn season of prayer with him. I felt drawn out to pray most earnestly for him. He prayed for himself. I was really afraid that unless he obtained relief, he would lose his mind. I laid my hands upon him, and in the name of the Lord rebuked the enemy. I felt it was a case where the Lord only could say, \"Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.\" God only could keep his mind balanced under the terrible strain that was upon him. I knew that the Lord heard our united prayers.--Letter 104, 1900, pp. 2-4. (To Sister Wessels and Sister Anthony, July 16, 1900.)",
