    "word": "The Lord has wonderful truth to make known through human instrumentalities. He permits those who turn from light and despise His warnings to show on which side they stand by oppressing His people. This will not destroy God's servants if they will hold fast to their faith. It will keep them contrite and humble, preventing them from being exalted above measure by the abundance of light given them.--Ms 106, 1897. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Nov. 5, 1987.
