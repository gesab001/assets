    "word": "Let us consider this ladder that was presented to Jacob. The human race was cut off from intercourse [communication] with God. They might look at a paradise lost but could see no means of entering it and holding communion with heaven. The sin of Adam cut off all intercourse between heaven and earth. Up to the moment Adam and Eve transgressed God\u2019s law there had been free communion between earth and heaven. They were connected by a path Deity could traverse. But the transgression of God\u2019s law broke up this path, and the human race was separated from God.",
