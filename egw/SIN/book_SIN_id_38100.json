I have had a discouraging weight upon my spirits for months, which has nearly crushed me. That which discourages me the most, is, the fear that all I may write will do no more good than our earnest, anxious, wearing labor, the past winter and spring, in Battle Creek. The hopeless view I have taken of matters and things at Battle Creek, has kept my pen, nearly still, and my voice nearly silent. My hands have been weakened, and my heart depressed, to see nothing gained by the protracted effort there. I am nearly hopeless in regard to our efforts' being successful to awaken the sensibilities of our Sabbath-keeping people to see the elevated position God requires them to occupy. They do not view religious things from an elevated standpoint. This is just your condition.",
