    "word": "The ten holy precepts spoken by Christ upon Sinai's mount were the revelation of the character of God, and made known to the world the fact that He had jurisdiction over the whole human heritage. That law of ten precepts of the greatest love that can be presented to man is the voice of God from heaven speaking to the soul in promise, \"This do, and you will not come under the dominion and control of Satan.\" There is not a negative in that law, although it may appear thus. It is DO, and Live (Letter 89, 1898).",
