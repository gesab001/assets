    "word": "My heart greatly desires the help that God alone can give me. He is my all and in all. We have every encouragement to bring all our difficulties to our heavenly Father. He understands our necessities, and He will not misinterpret the expression of our needs in words. In my physical weakness I will draw nigh unto God. He always understands me. I will not reason my case before Him.",
