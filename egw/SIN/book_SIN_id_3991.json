    "word": "Christ is your Redeemer; He will take no advantage of your humiliating confessions. If you have sin of a private character, confess it to Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\" 1 John 2:1. If you have sinned by withholding from God His own in tithes and offerings, confess your guilt to God and to the church, and heed the injunction that He has given you: \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse.\" Malachi 3:10.
