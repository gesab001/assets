    "word": "Sanitariums and Schools to Be Located Near Each Other--I wish to speak of some things presented before me concerning the establishment of the school and the sanitarium that is to be established near Nashville [Madison institutions]. Careful attention is to be given to the advantage that may be gained in locating these institutions near each other. In regard to the institutions to be established in Takoma Park [Washington Adventist Hospital and Columbia Union College], I was shown that the Lord would certainly be honored were these institutions placed near enough one another to be a help and a blessing to one another. \n\n\n                                   -167-",
