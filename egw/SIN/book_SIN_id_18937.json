    "word": "FAMILY PRAYER BRINGS STRENGTH AND BLESSINGS.\u2014We should pray to God much more than we do. There is great strength and blessing in praying together in our families, with and for our children. When my children have done wrong, and I have talked with them kindly and then prayed with them, I have never found it necessary after that to punish them. Their hearts would melt in tenderness before the Holy Spirit that came in answer to prayer.\u2014(Child Guidance, 525.)",
