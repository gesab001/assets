    "word": "If these words will not thrill through every soul as he shall contemplate them, what will? This is the price of our salvation--the most humiliating, agonizing death a human being could suffer. And the Son of God endured this shame as the penalty of guilt, in order that the sinner may stand guiltless and innocent before the throne of God. See what may arise from the height of exaltation from which our Saviour came, and the depth of humiliation to which He reached in order to grasp the sinner and lift him up to become a partaker of His divine nature, and link his life, his soul, with the Infinite God. When we obtain a sight of that cross; when that suffering, agonized cry, \"It is finished,\" pierces our ears, the sacrifice is complete. His love has imprinted the name of every saint upon the palms of His hands.",
