    "word": "My brother, we must not become too deeply involved in responsibilities of a commercial character. Thus we place ourselves where we become unfitted to do the special work that in this last time is to be carried forward. Our hearts must not be pressed beneath burdens of a financial character. We must not spend our time and energy in a work which, upon critical examination, is found to yield but little result in the salvation of souls. If the work in which you have been engaged brings a harvest of souls, this will certainly be seen. Do not allow a load of perplexing business to bind you and your family to close, hard labor in a work in which soul-saving is not the main feature. Do not incur a heavy debt in an effort to carry forward lines of work that do little to bring souls to the truth, lines of work in which the commercial interests are the main feature.",
