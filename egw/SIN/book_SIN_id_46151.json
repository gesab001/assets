    "word": "However great and glorious the full and perfect deliverance from evil we shall realize in heaven it is not all to be kept for the time of final deliverance. God brings it into our present life. We need daily to cultivate faith in a present Saviour. Trusting in a power out of and above ourselves and this exercise of faith in unseen support and power which is waiting the demand of the needy and dependent we then can trust amid clouds as well as sunshine, singing of present deliverance and present enjoyment of His love.",
