    "word": "What we all need is a more pure, Christlike sympathy; not sympathy for those who are perfect--they do not need it--but sympathy for poor, suffering, struggling souls who are often overtaken in fault, sinning and repenting, tempted and discouraged. The effect of grace is to soften and subdue the soul. Then all this cold unapproachableness is melted, subdued, and Christ appears.",
