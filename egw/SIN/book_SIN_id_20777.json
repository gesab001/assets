    "word": "Not a Test Question \nTo My Brethren in the Ministry: \n\nDear Fellow Workers-- \n\n\n     I have words to speak to . . . all who have been active in urging their views in regard to the meaning of \"the daily\" of Daniel 8. This is not to be made a test question, and the agitation that has resulted from its being treated as such has been very unfortunate. Confusion has resulted, and the minds of some of our brethren have been diverted from the thoughtful consideration that should have been given to the work that the Lord has directed should be done at this time in our cities. This has been pleasing to the great enemy of our work.",
