    "word": "Wednesday afternoon I attended a meeting for the sisters in Federal Hall at the Echo Office, North Fitzroy. Eighty-five were present, and I spoke to them in regard to the duties of mothers in the education and training of their children to become children of God, fitted for the future, immortal life. I opened the meeting with prayer, and closed it with prayer. At the close I began to feel that with all my writing and the work I had to do in bearing plain testimonies to individuals, \n                                                                           1098\nI was using up my capital of strength faster than I could afford. But mothers came to me and expressed themselves as so grateful to hear the very things they needed. Some said, \"This meeting will never lose its influence upon me. I see that there are many changes for me to make in the training of my children. But O, I am so glad that I was not left to come up in the judgment so ignorant in regard to my duty.\" Though very weary, I did not regret the effort I made.",
