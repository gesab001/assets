    "word": "Two plain, simple, substantial buildings have been erected for school purposes. The main building is not yet built. We are using a wing, which will answer until we can get means to advance on the main building. We will soon be compelled to build a chapel. We are so thankful that we have been able to make a beginning: and we earnestly desire to have this school such as the Lord shall approve.",
