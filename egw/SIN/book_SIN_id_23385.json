    "word": "Do not frown and fret when any task is required of you, but cheerfully carry the little burdens. . . . They are nothing but plain, homely, every-day duties, and may appear to you very small and insignificant, but some one must do them. If you go about them with quick step, and a heart glad because you do something to lighten the cares of your parents, you will be a blessing in the home. You do not know how much good you can do by always wearing a cheerful, sunny face, and watching for opportunities to help. . . . Day by day you are building for eternity. Fashion your characters after the divine model. Weave into them all the kindness, thoughtful obedience, pains-taking, and love that you can. . . . Cultivate quick sympathy; always have a cheerful, happy face, and be ready to lend a helping hand to those who need your aid. . . . He [God] will make an accurate entry of every deed done to His glory. . . . And in the great day of final accounts you will receive a glorious reward. \n                                                                           150",
