    "word": "It is not that God sends out a decree that man shall not be saved. He does not throw a darkness before the eyes which cannot be penetrated.

Then comes the harvest to be reaped from the seed of unbelief and resistance. Oh what a harvest of sinful indulgences is preparing for the sickle! . . .",
