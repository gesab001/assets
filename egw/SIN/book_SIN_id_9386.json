    "word": "Abraham's unquestioning obedience was one of the most striking instances of faith, of reliance upon God, to be found in the Sacred Record. With only the naked promise that his descendants should possess Canaan, without the least outward evidence, he followed on where God should lead, fully and sincerely complying with the conditions on his part, and confident that the Lord would faithfully perform his word. The patriarch went wherever God indicated his duty; he passed through wildernesses without terror; he went among idolatrous nations with the one thought, \u201cGod has spoken; I am obeying his voice; he will guide, he will protect me.\u201d",
