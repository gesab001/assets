    "word": "You and your wife can be a source of help and strength to each other, and a blessing to the sanitarium. Prayer is the key that will unlock the treasure of heaven to you. Let your faith increase. Increased faith and sanctification of the spirit, will qualify you to be a wise counsellor. Words spoken in season and in the spirit of tenderness, accompanied by the silent working of the Holy Spirit, will make the right impression. Do not think that you are accomplishing nothing because you cannot see definite results for your work. You are to sow the seed, knowing not which shall prosper, this or that.",
