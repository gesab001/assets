    "word": "Brother Burrill has written to me because he understood that I had encouraged Brother Robinson to come to San Diego. At first I could remember nothing in regard to the matter. But after I received Brother Ballenger's letter stating that Brother Robinson was expected in San Diego soon to act as business manager of the Sanitarium, I remembered that Brother Robinson was one whose name had been mentioned in some of our councils. I think he was presented as one who was not well, and who needed a change of climate. I asked if he were qualified to act as manager. When it was stated that he seemed to have the qualifications necessary for the place, I think I said, \"Then by all means let him come.\" But I did not present this as light that had been given me by the Lord. It was merely my personal judgment, formed from your presentation of the case.",
