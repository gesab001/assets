    "word": "Songs of David's Experience--The fifty-first psalm is an expression of David's repentance, when the message of reproof came to him from God. . . . Thus in a sacred song to be sung in the public assemblies of his people, in the presence of the court--priests and judges, princes and men of war--and which would preserve to the latest generation the knowledge of his fall, the king of Israel recounted his sin, his repentance, and his hope of pardon through the mercy of God.--PP 724, 725.",
