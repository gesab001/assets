    "word": "The spirit of gain getting, of making haste to be rich, of this all-absorbing worldliness, is painfully contradictory to our faith and doctrines. Should the Lord most high be pleased to impart His Holy Spirit, and seek to revive His work, how many would be hungering for the heavenly manna, and thirsting for the waters of life? . . . I see there is danger of some of our brethren saying, as did the foolish rich man, \"Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\" Many are forgetting that they are God's servants, and are saying, \"Tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.\" God is looking on your every business transaction. Be on your guard. It is time that deep, earnest thought should be given to laying up treasure in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.",
