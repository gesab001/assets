    "word": "One mother with her child had left her home to find Jesus. On the way she told a neighbor her errand, and the neighbor wanted to have Jesus bless her children. Thus several mothers came together, with their little ones. Some of the children had passed beyond the years of infancy to childhood and youth. . . . But He waited to see how the disciples would treat them. When He saw them send the mothers away, thinking to do Him a favor, He showed them their error,  saying, \"Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.\" He took the children in His arms, He laid His hands upon them, and gave them the blessing for which they came.",
