    "word": "God is plenteous in mercy. \"He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever.\" Just as soon as men heed his warnings, and set their own hearts in order, he will make the rough places plain before them. It is God that is dealing with his people. Trials as well as blessings come from him. His hand is to be acknowledged in all.",
