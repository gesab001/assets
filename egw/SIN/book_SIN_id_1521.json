    "word": "Under all circumstances\u2014whether in prosperity or in adversity, whether received or rejected, whether at the marriage feast or suffering the pangs of hunger\u2014Christ remained faithful to every precept of God\u2019s law, and wrought out for our example a perfect life. He has endured every hardship that comes to the poor and afflicted. Without sin He has suffered weariness and hunger. He understands every inconvenience to which we may be put. From childhood to manhood He stood the test of obedience.",
