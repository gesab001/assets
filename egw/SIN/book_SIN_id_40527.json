    "word": "If those who are consecrated unite to work untiringly for souls, they can do great good in our conferences and in our camp-meetings. Our camp-meetings must not be treated indifferently. Let the time of these gatherings be regarded as precious, and let it be devoted to seeking the Lord sincerely for a fitness to serve the Lord in humility. In many cases there should be less of lengthy sermonizing, and more hunting and fishing for souls.",
