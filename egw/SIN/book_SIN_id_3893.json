    "word": "Biblical Instruction\nChrist noticed the devotion to dress, and He cautioned, yea, He commanded, His followers not to bestow too much thought upon it. \"Why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\" Pride and extravagance in dress are sins to which woman is especially prone; hence these injunctions relate directly to her. Of how little value are gold or pearls or costly array, when compared with the meekness and loveliness of Christ!",
