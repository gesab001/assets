    "word": "You had better live very humbly, and keep a clear conscience. Owe no man anything, and you will not have so much perplexity. Live within your means. Shun debts, as you would a great evil. It is much easier for you to slide into debt, flattering yourself with future success, than it is to realize your anticipations and free yourself. You are a poor financier. You are a poor manager. You should not rely upon your own judgment. You should counsel with men who have made life a success, and be guided by their counsel. If you would do this, you would save yourself great trials, and your course would be more pleasing to God.                Ellen G. White. \n\n                                               -",
