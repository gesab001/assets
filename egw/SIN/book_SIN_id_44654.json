    "word": "Study the Bible and then you will break with the associates in secret societies. Jesus associated with publicans and sinners and ate with them--not in words or spirit to become one of them, but by His words to sow the seeds of truth that they might be enlightened and become one with Him. And His influence was not in vain. We are not to go out of the world, but we are to be as stars shining amid the moral darkness, that souls may come to the light and by seeing our good works glorify God. When thou are converted, then thou wilt have a work to do to enlighten others.",
