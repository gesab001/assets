    "word": "Such are a greater affliction to the church than any of the influences we meet with from unbelievers. The \n\n\n                                     -335- \n\nvery worst elements will become instruments in the hands of Satan to obtain sympathizers. For this reason we see the need of using great caution in selecting persons to take responsibility in the school and in the church, for Satan will set these unsanctified ones to work to clog the wheels, to question, to find fault, to create suspicion, disunion, and a disordered state of things, and all the time they will think they are doing God's service. These elements are already at work in the church, but their work is not yet fully developed. Much is kept in the dark. An undercurrent is working. Satan lays hold of those who are self-willed and who move from impulse, and skillfully diverts them into channels where they will be an element of weakness in the church.",
