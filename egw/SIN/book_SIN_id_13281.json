    "word": "View at Lovett's Grove, Ohio \n\n     In the spring of 1858, we visited Ohio, and attended conferences at Green Springs, Gilboa, and Lovett's Grove. At Lovett's Grove the Lord's blessing rested upon us in special power. On Sunday afternoon there was a funeral service at the schoolhouse where our meetings were being held. My husband was invited to speak. He was blessed with freedom, and the words spoken seemed to affect the hearers.",
