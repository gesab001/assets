    "word": "Last-Day Scoffers \n\n     From the beginning of my work, I have been pursued by hatred, reproach, and falsehood. Base imputations and slanderous reports have been greedily gathered up and widely circulated by the rebellious, the formalist, and the fanatic.

The scoffers of the last days are led on by these ministers professing to be God's watchmen.",
