    "word": "While many have reduced the Word, the Truth, the holy law of Jehovah to a dead letter, and by their example testify that the law of Jehovah is a hard, rigorous burden, while they say, We will lay off this yoke; we will be free; we will no longer remain in covenant relation with God; we will do as we please, there will be men who have had very meagre opportunities, who have walked in ways of error because they knew not any other or better way, to whom beams of light will come. As the word from Christ came to Zacchaeus, \u201cI must abide at thy house,\u201d so the word will come to them. And the one supposed to be a hardened sinner will be found to have a heart as tender as a child, because Christ has deigned to notice him.",
