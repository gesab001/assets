    "word": "Our precious Saviour came to this world to bring blessing to us. He left His seat in glory to lift man from his fallen condition. Oh, that we would appreciate His great sacrifice! While here He was met by the archenemy, the adversary of souls, and He resisted his temptations. Christ did not leave His seat of glory to mingle with the rich and great men of earth, for they would not receive His instructions, but He chose the poor who were willing to receive Him. There were some rich who did believe, but were unwilling openly to acknowledge Christ. We find in our day men of wealth, men the world call great, who, if the message for this time were presented to them, would turn from it because of the cross. God does not design to leave us in error, but sends us messages of mercy that we may have eternal life. Shall we accept or reject?",
