    "word": "As one long experienced in the truth, it was your place to be among those who should first catch the message from the God of heaven, and voice it to the people; but the enemy presented in a magnified light every matter that seemed objectionable to you, and your imagination has not pictured facts to you. The enemy had prepared a long chain of circumstances, like links in a chain, that you might be prevented from standing where you should have stood. You have lost a rich and powerful experience, and that loss, resulting from refusing the precious treasures of truth presented to you, is still your loss. You are not where God would have had you, and you have missed the providential links one after another in the chain, so that now it is hard for you to see the mysterious connections in the endless chain of providence in His special work.",
