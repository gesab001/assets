    "word": "Women of Different Nationalities to Be Educated.--Missions are being established; and if the converting power of the truth comes to\n134\nour youth, we shall see them pressing into the ranks of the workers. Had they been educated from the beginning of their religious experience to be true to their faith, fervent in piety, and in sympathy with Christ's longing for the salvation of souls, we would have hundreds of missionaries where we have one today. In every mission established, there should be a school for the education of laborers. The very best German, French, and Scandinavian [ONLY THREE PEOPLE GROUPS ARE MENTIONED, BUT THE PRINCIPLE WOULD FOLLOW THAT ALL GROUPS NEED TO BE REPRESENTED.] talent should be enlisted in the work of educating promising young men and women of these different nationalities. This essential matter has been greatly neglected. In the office at Battle Creek, at Basel, and at Christiana [now Oslo], there is pressing need of translators in these different languages. . . . We want a hundred workers where there is one.",
