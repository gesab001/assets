    "word": "Influence of godly example\n     There are few parents who realize how important it is to give to their children the influence of a godly example. Yet this is far more potent than precept. No other means is so effective in training them in right lines. The children and youth must have a true copy in \n52\nright-doing if they succeed in overcoming sin and perfecting a Christian character. This copy they should find in the lives of their parents. If they enter the city of God and rejoice in the overcomer's reward, someone must show them the way. By living before their children godly, consistent lives, parents may make the work before them clear and plain.",
