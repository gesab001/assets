    "word": "Ministers must learn to give room to their fellow laborers. They are not to measure their brethren by their own ideas. He is whose heart Christ abides will not quarrel with his brother. All are to stand under the standard of Christ Jesus, united by the desire to strengthen His work in every line. Human devising is not to be followed. Let no one fasten his soul to a human leader. Christ is our Leader. He was sent by the Father to redeem the fallen race. Men are to follow His directions in the work of restoring the moral image of God in the human race. In this great work they are to act in His name and for the glory of God.",
