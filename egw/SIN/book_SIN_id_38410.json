    "word": "Chap. 22 - The First Lesson \n\n     \"'I wish I could set before the medical student the true responsibility which rests upon him in his work. There is not one in one hundred who has a just sense of his position, his work, his accountability to God, and how much God will do for him if he will make Him his trust. The very first lesson that he should learn is dependence upon God. Make God your counselor at every step. The worldly and the nominal Christian may insinuate that in order for you to be successful you must be a policy man, you must at times depart from the strictest rectitude; but be not deceived, be not deluded. . . . Throw not open a door for the enemy to take possession of the citadel of the soul.",
