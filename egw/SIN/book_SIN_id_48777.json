    "word": "And when you are straining every nerve and every muscle to make the work a success, you are yourself led to be sharp in the use of the pen, and it hurts your influence to do the same work they are doing in criticising. And as this work has been hurting them, and as the enemy sees he can hurt you, weaken your hands, and discourage your heart, he is pleased. You are wearing out too fast, and the Lord does not require that you and Emma should, under the existing state of things, carry the load without the cooperation of those in responsible places. Some would encourage you if there was not such an influence to meet in doing so. Therefore you are sacrificing life and health under a great disadvantage, and must have a respite. Your own spirit is becoming soured and you tempted. Now the Lord would have you come apart and rest awhile, and let the Southern field be worked by men whom they may choose to put into it, and let the responsibility rest upon them, and they carry it.",
