    "word": "Under all circumstances--whether in prosperity or in adversity, whether received or rejected, whether at the marriage feast or suffering the pangs of hunger--Christ remained faithful to every precept of God's law, and wrought out for our example a perfect life. He has endured every hardship that comes to the poor and the afflicted. Without sin He has suffered weariness and hunger. He understands every inconvenience to which we may be put. From childhood to manhood He stood the test of obedience.",
