    "word": "To Nicodemus this was a very humiliating statement, and with a feeling of irritation he took up the words of Christ, saying, \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" He was not spiritually minded enough to discern the meaning of the words of Christ.

That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\" \n\n\n                      -45-",
