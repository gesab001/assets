    "word": "(813) \"Thus saith the Lord, in an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritage that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, show thyselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places. They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them; for He that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the spring of water shall He guide them. And I will make all My mountains a way, and My highways shall be exalted. Behold these shall come from far; and lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.",
