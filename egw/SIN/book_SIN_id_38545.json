    "word": "Advancement in Christian experience is characterized by increasing humility, as the result of increasing knowledge. Every one who is united to Christ, will depart from all iniquity. I tell you, in the fear of God, I have been shown that many of you will fail of everlasting life, because you are building your hopes of Heaven on a false foundation. God is leaving you to yourselves, \"to humble thee, to prove thee, and to know what is in thine heart.\" You have neglected the Scriptures. You despise and reject the testimonies, because they reprove your darling sins, and disturb your self-complacency. When Christ is cherished in the heart, his likeness will be revealed in the life. Humility will reign where pride was once predominant: Submission, meekness, patience, will soften down the rugged features of a naturally perverse, impetuous disposition. Love to Jesus will be manifested in love to his people. It is not fitful, not spasmodic, but calm, and deep, and strong. The life of the Christian will be divested of all pretense, free from all affectation, artifice and falsehood. It is earnest, true, sublime. Christ speaks in every word. He is seen in every deed. The life is radiant with the light of an indwelling Saviour. In converse with God, and in happy contemplation of heavenly things, the soul is preparing for Heaven, and laboring to gather other souls into the fold of Christ. Our Saviour is able and willing to do for us more than we can ask or even think.",
