    "word": "Here, my brother, Dr. J. H. Kellogg has been and will be your danger, in your scientific researches; unless you are daily increasing in the knowledge and love of the truth, growing up into Christ, your living head, you are in positive danger. I have not at present anything to say to you or Elder ----- in regard to the author of the book published. I have not strength to give to these questions, but I know that the Lord has been pleased to show me, in clear lines, your danger in the past and at the present time. Be careful how you favor these things that limit the power of God. The time is right upon \n\n\n                                     -358- \n\nus when the whole earth will be lightened with His glory. That light is beginning to shine already, and your special study should be to keep pace with the opening providence of God. For it is a terrible thing to be spiritually blind. It is fatal for man to feel safe to walk in sparks of his own kindling. Sophistry will weave for you a very fine web; I fear that it will ensnare you.--Letter 18, 1892.",
