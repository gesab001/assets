    "word": "\u201cIn My name,\u201d Christ bade His disciples pray. In Christ\u2019s name His followers are to stand before God. Through the value of the sacrifice made for them, they are of value in the Lord\u2019s sight. Because of the imputed righteousness of Christ they are accounted precious. For Christ\u2019s sake the Lord pardons those that fear Him. He does not see in them the vileness of the sinner. He recognizes in them the likeness of His Son, in whom they believe.\u2014(The Desire of Ages, 667.)",
