    "word": "Many of our brethren and sisters do not discern the wondrous things that are to be seen in God's law. They have not beheld that which was revealed to Moses when he prayed, \"I beseech Thee, show me Thy glory\" (Exodus 33:18). To Moses was revealed God's character. \"The Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty\" (Exodus 34:5-7).",
