    "word": "Solution to Problems of Despondence and Criticism.--When our church members during the week act their part in the service of the Lord, they will be roused from the despondency that is ruining many, body and soul. As they \n\n\n                                     -93- \n\nwork for others, they will have much that is helpful to speak of when they assemble to worship God. The Sabbath meeting will be like meat in due season; for all will bring precious offerings to the Lord. When God's people see the great need of sinners being converted, turned from the service of Satan to serve the living God, the testimonies they bear in the Sabbath service will not be dark and gloomy, but full of joy and courage, life and power. Instead of thinking and talking about the faults of their brethren and sisters, and about their own trials, they will think and talk of the love of Christ, and will strive earnestly to become more efficient workers for Him.-- Manuscript 127, 1903, p. 6. (\"A Call to Service,\" October 27, 1903.)",
