    "word": "I need not present the self-denial, the self-sacrifice, the humiliation, and crucifixion of the Son of God, which was the redemption price of a lost world. This we need to contemplate that we may better estimate the value of the human soul. As we view the agonies which Christ endured as the price of redemption, we will consider every soul of value. The love of Jesus for souls cannot be measured. Christ died to save not only the few who accept Him; no, He came to our world to save every son and daughter of Adam. He came not to seek and save those who were faultless and lovely, but He came to seek and to save them that are lost. \"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\" He is the true Shepherd, ever ready to leave the flock which is in the fold and to go into the wilderness to seek for the lost sheep.",
