    "word": "I was shown that you were in great trial, and I said, \"Look up where there is light.\" God loves you, and will not leave you if you will only trust in Him. I know now what some things mean that have been presented to me. You are passing over the same ground that you have passed again and again in times past. I have not heard one word of anything discouraging about you, or of anything that would test your faith; but I saw that you were in great trial, and sorely tempted. The one who has been my guide so many times said, \"Fret not thyself in anywise to do evil. This test and trial is permitted to come upon you; but God lives, and you are to be strengthened and encouraged in the Lord.\" . . .",
