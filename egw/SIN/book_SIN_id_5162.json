    "word": "Our Lord Jesus Christ was rich, yet for our sake He became poor, that we through His poverty might be rich. He bids all whom He has entrusted with temporal blessings to follow His example. Jesus says, \"Ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good.\" The want and wretchedness in the world are constantly appealing to our compassion and sympathy, and the Saviour declares that ministry to the afflicted and suffering is the service most pleasing to Him. \"Is it not,\" He says, \"to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou \n                                                                           162\ncover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\" We are to minister to the sick, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, and to instruct the ignorant.",
