    "word": "I spoke at eleven o'clock with much freedom from Isaiah 6:8. We had a social meeting and many excellent testimonies were borne. The presence of Jesus was in our midst and our hearts were made glad to see that as many as one half of the number had been united with the church since I was here two years ago. There was a most intelligent company present. My soul was blessed on this day. I will wait upon the Lord, and I will put my trust in Him who loveth us. We must lean more heavily upon our Support and Strength. I am praying for the presence of the Lord Jesus in our midst. I see that there are many things to be done. I must jot them down in scratch books and transfer them.",
