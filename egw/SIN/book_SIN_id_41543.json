    "word": "The Lord accepts all the obedience of every creature He has made, according to the circumstances of time in the sun-rising and sun-setting world. Obedience is the test; and all this ploughing into the intricacy of the precise minutes and hours of the Sabbath--it is the test of man's obedience to honor and glorify God. To sin, or transgression of His law, God will prove a consuming fire. [He says,] The Sabbath observance is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations forever.",
