    "word": "Your recent letter was received. You write like an honest man, and I believe you to be sincere, but you are a man greatly deceived. In the past, I have had a great interest in your welfare. I have regarded you as a man who feared God and kept His commandments.

You followed your own impulses in this matter instead of moving in the counsel of God.",
