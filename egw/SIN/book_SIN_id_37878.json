    "word": "The brethren in this meeting were counseling in regard to the work at Nashville. One present was speaking in a very decided manner, expressing his views in regard to the publishing house in Nashville and the general management of the work there. Much was said, and it was all very discouraging. Matters were presented in a strong light. Some present had gathered up the testimonies of those who were unfavorably inclined toward the Nashville publishing house. If actions had been taken based upon these misrepresentations, great injustice would have been done to the Southern work. Decisions would have been made that would have had a most discouraging effect, \n                                                                           72\napparently upholding that which the Lord condemns.",
