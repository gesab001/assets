    "word": "I feel so grateful that the Lord is of tender pity, full of mercy. He deals not with us according to our sins, but is long-suffering. He sees our weakness. He knows our defects, our lack of faith and courage, and yet He bears with us still. The same divine sympathy, the same patient love, He shows to us who are so unworthy of His favors. I am not what I ought to be, or what Jesus would have me. I see that I must have more of the spirit of the Master.",
