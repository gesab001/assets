    "word": "When you have a knowledge of God's will, you will follow Christ in all things, and he will hide you in a cleft of the rock, and cover you with his hand, that you may lose sight of self, and behold his glory. Moses said to the Lord, \"I beseech thee, show me thy glory.\" \"And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, \n\n\n                       - 10 - \n\nand abundant is goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.\" This is a representation of the passing by of God. It is a true description of the after- influence of all his working in the path where he goes.",
