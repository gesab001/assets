    "word": "It is a terrible thing for human agents to sin, and to crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to an open shame. I have a message from God to you. It is, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" When you behold Him in His matchless love, bearing the sins of the world, when you behold Him exercising His compassion and love for sinners, and realize that it was for you that the innocent, holy, undefiled Lamb of God stood as one guilty to endure your punishment, that you who are sinful and deserving [of punishment], might stand innocent, clothed with the garments of Christ's righteousness, your heart will be melted by His incomparable love, and you will accept Him as your sin-pardoning Saviour. You must not walk in darkness. God has given you wise counselors \n\n\n                                    -75- \n\nthose who love and fear Him, and those who love the souls of all for whom Christ died. Do not turn from counsel, but take heed to words of instruction. The Lord is soon to come; make no delay. Come to Jesus every day, and tell Him you want strength, you want heavenly wisdom, to understand what is sin and how to forsake it. You cannot take your way and do your will and be perverse in spirit, and yet love Jesus and be acknowledged of Him as His child.",
