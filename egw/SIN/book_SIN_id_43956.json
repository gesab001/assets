    "word": "Some years ago I had a dream. I dreamed we were out upon the water. There were several in the boat besides myself, and there were other boats about us. The other boats were watching to see what course our boat would take. We had, every one of us, oars, and were rowing with all our might. While we were thus urging our boat along, I saw two or three of the other boats capsize, and the persons thrown from them began to sink. They had no power to save themselves or to get hold of the boat again.",
