The risen saints bore witness to the truth of the words, \u201cThy dead men shall live, together with My dead body shall they arise.\u201d Their resurrection was an illustration of the fulfillment of the prophecy, \u201cAwake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.\u201d Isaiah 26:19.",
