    "word": "MRS. WHITE, IN BOOKS INTENDED FOR THE READING OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, DESIGNEDLY LEFT OUT ALL EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS \"I SAW\" AND \"I WAS SHOWN,\" LEST THE READERS, BEING UNFAMILIAR WITH HER EXPERIENCE, SHOULD HAVE THEIR MINDS DIVERTED FROM THE MESSAGE ITSELF. ONE LOOKS IN VAIN THROUGH THE FIVE VOLUMES OF THE CONFLICT SERIES FOR ONE SUCH EXPRESSION, YET IN HER INTRODUCTION TO THE GREAT CONTROVERSY, THE FIRST OF THE SERIES THAT APPEARED IN 1888, AND ELSEWHERE, SHE MAKES IT KNOWN THAT SHE WITNESSED EVENTS TAKE PLACE AND WAS \"BIDDEN TO MAKE KNOWN TO OTHERS THAT WHICH HAS BEEN REVEALED\" (P. XI). SEE ALSO STEPS TO CHRIST, THOUGHTS FROM THE MOUNT OF BLESSING, CHRIST'S OBJECT LESSONS, EDUCATION, AND THE MINISTRY OF HEALING. \"SISTER WHITE IS NOT THE ORIGINATOR OF THESE BOOKS,\" SHE WROTE.",
