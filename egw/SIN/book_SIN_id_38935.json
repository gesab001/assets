    "word": "Let those who handle \"Christ's Object Lessons\" pray in faith that the Lord will help them to speak words which will be a blessing to those whom they meet while presenting the book for sale. Carefully improve the opportunities to sow the seeds of truth. Do not introduce doctrinal subjects, nor engage in controversy, but speak of the Christian's faith and hope. Thus you will become acquainted with persons whom you may afterward visit, with the Bible in hand, and upon whom you may reflect the light which God has given to you. You will find opportunities to comfort the depressed and discouraged, and to lift up those that are bowed down.",
