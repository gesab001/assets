Their rooms may not always be so constructed as to allow the windows or doors open in their rooms, without the draught coming directly \n                                                                           456\nupon them, and exposing them to take cold. In such cases windows and doors should be opened in an adjoining room, and thus let the fresh air enter the room occupied by the sick.
