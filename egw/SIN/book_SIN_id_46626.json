    "word": "Battle Creek, October 20, 1889 \n\n     I attended ministers' meeting. The Spirit of the Lord was in our midst. Several bore testimony of the blessings received during the past year, of the blessed light they had received and cherished, which was justification through faith. They were delivered from bondage and had realized the rich blessing of God in their labor. They had clearer and more distinct views of the love of Jesus, and their hearts were made joyful in God.",
