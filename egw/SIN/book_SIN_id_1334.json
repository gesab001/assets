    "word": "The fact that human beings can please God is a wonderful incentive for us to make the most persevering, intense efforts, efforts which are proportionate to the value of the object that we are seeking to gain. \u201cWe are labourers together with God: ye are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s building.\u201d . . .

We are ever to walk with God and learn of Jesus Christ, who has overcome every temptation wherewith we are beset. He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.",
