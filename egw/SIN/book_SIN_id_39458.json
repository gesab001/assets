    "word": "Let everyone who has named the name of Christ depart from all iniquity. Lift up Jesus. Talk of His love, tell of His power, and let self be lost behind the glory of His person and the mighty power of the cross of Calvary. Oh, search and try your hearts before God. If His gospel is preached, you will rejoice, by whomsoever it is preached. If you love Jesus, you will be individually laborers together with God, and you will successfully draw souls to Jesus, that in their turn they will, by their influence, draw other souls to the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world.",
