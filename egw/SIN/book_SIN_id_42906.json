    "word": "\"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" Wonderful are the possibilities placed before us, and to these possibilities we may attain by studying and practicing the Word of God. But \n\n\n                                   -348- \n\nif we do not lay hold of Christ, if we do not daily gain an experimental knowledge of Him as our sufficiency, we are constantly losing ground. Many professed Christians have not yet reached the height and breadth of Christlikeness. We are to behold Christ by faith as the One whose perfection of character we are to obtain. With an intense, prayerful desire to be like Him, we are to behold Him, full of tenderness and love. Then, as we behold, we shall be changed into His likeness. He is the author and finisher of our faith.",
