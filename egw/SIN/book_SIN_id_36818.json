    "word": "The Sin of the Age \n\n     18. Sensuality is the sin of the age. But the religion of Jesus Christ will hold the lines of control over every species of unlawful liberty; the moral powers will hold the lines of control over every thought, word, and action. Guile will not be found in the lips of the true Christian. Not an impure thought will be indulged in, nor any careless movements, not a word spoken that is approaching to sensuality, not an action that has the least appearance of evil. MS-4a-1885.",
