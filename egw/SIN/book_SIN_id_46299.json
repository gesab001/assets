    "word": "We have seen of the grace of God since we met you last. Since last spring I have visited Lemoore, Fresno, and Selma. I was at the Selma camp meeting. During my stay there I was introduced to a tall man-- over six feet tall--and well proportioned. When he took my hand he seemed much affected and said, \"I am so glad to meet you; I am thankful that I can speak with you.\" After going into the tent a brother came in and said, \"That man has a history.\" Then he went on and told how a year before he had been converted; how he had once kept the Sabbath but had gone back, and how he claimed that he never had been converted. Then after he gave up the truth he went back into the company of hard cases, and Satan took complete possession of him. Two or three were linked with him in his wickedness--men who would not want it to be known that they were in such business. They stole and did wickedness in every way.",
