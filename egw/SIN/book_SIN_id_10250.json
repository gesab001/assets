    "word": "The doctrine preached by Zwingle was not received from Luther. It was the doctrine of Christ. \u201cIf Luther preaches Christ,\u201d said the Swiss reformer, \u201che does what I do. He has led to Christ many more souls than I;\u2014be it so. Yet will I bear no other name than that of Christ, whose soldier I am, and who alone is my head. Never has a single line been addressed by me to Luther, or by Luther to me. And why?\u2014That it might be manifest to all how uniform is the testimony of the Spirit of God, since we, who have had no communication with each other, agree so closely in the doctrine of Jesus Christ.\u201d",
