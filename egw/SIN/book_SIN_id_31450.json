    "word": "Communication of Light \n\n     I state truth. The souls who love God, who believe in Christ, and who eagerly grasp every ray of light, will see light, and rejoice in the truth.

They feel that they are in the council of the ungodly, of men who stand in the way of sinners, and sit in the seat of the scornful.",
