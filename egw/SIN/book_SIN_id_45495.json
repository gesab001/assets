    "word": "Let not the enemy deceive you. He has filled the world with his heresies. You want to plant your feet upon the Word of God; then you will be all ready to come under His rules and commandments in the kingdom of bliss. If you ever sing the song of triumph and redemption in the kingdom of God, you must first learn that song here. Is Jesus abiding in your heart? If he is, you will talk about Him. You will reveal Him in life and character. You will talk of His power and make melody to God in your heart. The sweet spirit of meekness will be cherished; self will be crucified. Purity and holiness will be developed in the character.",
