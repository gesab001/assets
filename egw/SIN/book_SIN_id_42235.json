    "word": "MR No. 966 - True Worship Vs. False Worship\n\n     Multiplying Machinery While Losing Love--I am afraid for you in Battle Creek. The Spirit of Christ is the missionary spirit that seeks to save that which was lost. This Spirit makes everyone who possesses it a worker together with God. The church is multiplying form and machinery, but more and more losing her first love. The church is responsible for the work of Christ, but the work as a whole which the church is doing will not bear the approval of God. It must bear the image of Christ; and unless the workers are invested with His divine attributes for the performance of that work, it is an offense to God.--Ms. 33, 1894, p. 1. (\"Testimony to Battle Creek,\" August 3, 1894.)",
