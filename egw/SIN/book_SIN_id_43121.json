    "word": "We have here a positive evidence that the anger of the Lord is awakened against the rebellious people--those who had been blessed with great light and precious opportunities to know the will of God, which was communicated to them by Christ Himself, their invisible Leader, enshrouded in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. God had been their defense against the vast army of Pharaoh; He had wrought for them, providing them food when hungry; He had quieted their murmurings by giving them springs of cool water flowing from the Rock. He had manifested to them His glory, and yet when Satan tempted them, they believed all the suggestions and representations he put into their minds against Moses and Aaron, against Joshua and Caleb. The Lord had worked wondrously for them, yet they were ever ready to turn away from them and follow the suggestions of Satan. But they were passing the boundary of God's forbearance and patience. He declared, \"I \n\n\n                                   -292- \n\nwill smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier then they.\"",
