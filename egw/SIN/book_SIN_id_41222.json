    "word": "There will be need not only of faith but of a trust in God. This is the true faith of Abraham, a faith which produced fruits. \"Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.\" James 2:23. When God told him to offer his son as a sacrifice it was the same voice that had spoken telling him to leave his country and go into a land which God would show him. Abraham \n\n\n                                    -357- \n\nwas saved by faith in Christ as verily as the sinner is saved by faith in Christ today.",
