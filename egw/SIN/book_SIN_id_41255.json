    "word": "Many seem to think that they must beg pardon of all the world for being a Christian. John did not regard it so. He says, \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" (1 John 3:1.)

Why should it not, when he is in connection with a pure and holy God, and the power which is invested in God He imparts to His sons and daughters. \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord. . . . And I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\" (2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.)
