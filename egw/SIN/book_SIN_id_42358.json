    "word": "Adam and Eve were banished from Eden for transgressing the law of God. Christ was to suffer without the boundaries of the holy place. He died \n\n\n                                    -397- \n\noutside the camp, where felons and murderers were executed. There He trod the wine press alone, suffering the penalty that should have rested on the sinner, to rest on Him. Oh, how deep and full of significance are the words, \"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us\" [Galatians 3:13]. He went forth without the camp, thus showing that He gave His life not only for the Jewish nation but for the whole world. The hand of the Lord was in the inscription \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews,\" that was written out in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and placed above the cross. Thus Christ proclaimed to all kindreds, tongues, and people, \"I gave My life for you. Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.\"",
