    "word": "Know you not that \"ye are not your own? for ye are bought with a price.\" What a price has been paid for us! Behold the cross, and the Victim uplifted upon it.

That suffering, that agony, is the price of your redemption. The word of command was given, \"Deliver them from going down to perish eternally. I have found a ransom.\"",
