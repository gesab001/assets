    "word": "You have a very large field to select from in the many testimonies. In Christian Education there is a rich supply, but if you think not best to select and use these things God has given for the instruction of His people and all to whom they may come, then you are right in laying them on one side. But if these things are of value, let them speak. I am a little puzzled over this matter. The request made is, Short articles, Sister White. This cannot always be. Therefore I leave you my books to select from, which would be new matter to the readers in this country, Australia, and New Zealand, and just what they need. I have felt no burden to write for the paper, because you had a new field of matter for this country, which would be a blessing to those who receive it. Selections are made of matter, apparently to fill up, from other papers. What the people want is instruction. What shall I do that I may save my soul? We need more and still more of vital godliness brought out in the papers.--Letter 21, 1896. \n                                                                           26",
