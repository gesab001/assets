    "word": "Beware--Lest We Lose Our Bearings [FROM AN EARLY, MORNING TALK BEFORE THE PACIFIC UNION MEDICAL MISSIONARY COUNCIL, SANITARIUM, CALIFORNIA, JUNE 19, 1902.] \n\n\n     Conformity to the world is causing many of our people to lose their bearings. I feel deeply over this matter, because it is continually kept before me by the Lord. For many years it has been presented to me again and again that a worldly policy has been coming into the management of many of our institutions. And when I read the published Testimonies that were given in the early seventies and even before that time, I am surprised to see how clearly our dangers in this matter have been pointed out, and how plainly the right way has been outlined from the beginning. But the way, so plainly specified, has not been followed. Men act as if counsels had never been given; and yet we expect the Lord to uplift us and to do great things for us! True, He will help us if we so relate ourselves to Him that He can; but He will not serve with us while we are weaving threads of selfishness into the web.",
