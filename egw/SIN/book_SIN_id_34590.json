    "word": "Privilege of Speech--Christians are to be Christlike in their earnest desire to save souls. They should regard it as the highest honor to be enlisted in Christ's army. They should thank God for the privilege of using the talent of speech to win souls to Christ. They should look upon no privilege as more precious than that of imparting to others the knowledge they have received.--RH Dec. 24, 1901.",
