Kilgore, leader of the effort in Graysville, with advice on how to proceed. The Graysville workers were contemplating purchasing a piece of property, and Mrs. White urged them to obtain it. She encourages Kilgore, impressing upon him the importance of the work in Graysville and Huntsville while advising him to stay moderate and patient.\nJune 11, 1902\n     I have a caution for my brethren who are working in the Southern field. Do not move hastily in establishing interests in new places, in a way that will divide your workers and your means, so that your force will be weakened. Wait until some of the interests that have been started more nearly approach perfection. Do not rush into new enterprises until the work that has already been started in Graysville and Huntsville is better established, and the interests in Nashville are strengthened. The reasons for strengthening the work in Nashville have been presented to you quite fully.",
