    "word": "This lesson should be carefully considered by our physicians and medical missionaries,- God establishes his instrumentalities among a people who recognize the laws of the divine government. The sick are to be healed through the combined effort of the human and divine. Every gift, every power, that Christ promised his disciples, he bestows upon those who will serve him faithfully. And he who gives mental capabilities, and who entrusts talents to the men and women who are his by creation and by redemption, expects that these talents and these capabilities shall be increased by use. Every talent must be employed in blessing others, and thus bringing honor to God. But physicians have been led to suppose that their capabilities were their own individual property: the powers given them for God's work they have used in branching out into lines of work to which God has not appointed them.",
