How I longed to see them come to their senses and see themselves as sinners, guilty before God and in need of a Saviour, and repent and be converted, or they would in their blindness, turn away from the light sent to them from God, and become completely enveloped in the mazes of unbelief and darkness. Day and night my burden was that the Saviour, rich in mercy and love, would reveal himself to these souls who were in such great danger, although professedly keeping and teaching the law of God, they were guilty before God as a transgressor of that law. The least guilt left upon the conscience, would be to their utter condemnation.
