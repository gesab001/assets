    "word": "Ye inhabitants of the earth, praise Him! And why? Because through Jesus Christ--whose long human arm encircles the race, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite--the gulf is bridged with His own body, and this atom of a world which was separated from the continent of heaven by sin and became an island is again reinstated, because Christ bridged the gulf (MS 5, 1891).",
