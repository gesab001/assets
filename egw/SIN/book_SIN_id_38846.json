    "word": "I was shown that things in the Office are not as God would have them. Bro. Amadon has too much to do. His mind is called in too many directions. His care should be divided with others. Bro. Bacheller and Bro. Amadon are not united as two laborers should be in the Office. Bro. Bacheller has had, during his life, a selfish temperament, and he has deprived himself of many precious blessings which he would have realized from God if he had been less self-caring. Bro. Amadon was not the one to correct this. He has felt that he must make Bro. Bacheller feel his selfishness, and Bro. and sister Amadon have been too zealous in making prominent Bro. Bacheller's deficiency in this respect, and have pressed him because of it. This has wounded Bro. Bacheller and his wife, and there has been an ugly sore festering a long time. The watching, and distrust, and jealousy, upon the part of Bro. Amadon and his wife, have resulted bad in the case of Bro. Bacheller and his family. Bro. Bacheller has, during his life, been too ready to shun burdens and responsibilities. Bro. \n                                                                           31\nand sister Amadon have been too ready to take them, and they have not borne them with a good grace. But the responsibilities that they have borne have too often resulted badly. Bro. and sister Amadon should not gather burdens and responsibilities, but should seek, in the fear of God, to correct their deficiencies, encourage calmness and self-control over their ardent temperaments. They should shun excitement and display. They have both sensational natures, and will be inclined to have a sensational religion, unless they are governed by principle instead of feeling.",
