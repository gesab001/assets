    "word": "The sincere believers of truth are made sad, and their trials and sorrows greatly increased, by the elements among them which annoy, dishearten, and discourage, them in their efforts. But the Lord teaches a lesson to his servants of great carefulness in all their moves. Let both grow together. Do not forcibly pull up the tares, lest in rooting them up, the precious blades will become loosened. The ministers and church should be very cautious, lest they get a zeal not according to knowledge. There is danger of doing too much to cure difficulties in the church which, if let alone, frequently work their own cure. It is bad policy to take hold of matters in any church prematurely. We shall have to exercise the greatest care, patience, and self-control, to bear these things and not go to work in our own spirit to set things in order.",
