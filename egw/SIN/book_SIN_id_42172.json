    "word": "The prospering hand of God is not evidenced by the numbers who patronize the sanitarium or attend services in the Tabernacle, but by the high standard of morals, their unwavering fidelity to God, and by the light which emanates from Christ, shining as His representatives and through them shedding the light of truth in the beauty of holiness to the world. All will not accept and be in harmony with the light given. They love not the things which bring their own neglect and sins to their mind.",
