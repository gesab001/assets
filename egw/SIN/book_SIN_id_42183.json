    "word": "God Desires to Save Sinful Man--God has revealed His character toward fallen man by giving him a Saviour, Jesus Christ. He covenanted not to stir up His wrath against the perversity of His children, not to censure them in His hot displeasure, until every advantage had been given them through all their period of probation. And even when they shall refuse His warnings, His messages of invitation, the presentation of His righteousness, when they continue to sin in the face of light and evidence, still He will not break forth upon them in His great anger. He leaves all judgment to His Son, whom He gave as a sin offering for the world.",
