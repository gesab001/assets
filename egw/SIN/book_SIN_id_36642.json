    "word": "None should go to the camp-meeting depending on the ministers or the Bible workers to make the meeting a blessing to them. God does not want his people to hang their weight on the ministers. He does not want them to be weakened by depending on human beings for help. They are not to lean, like helpless children, upon some one else as a prop. As a steward of the grace of God, every church member should feel an individual responsibility to have life and root in himself. All should feel that in a measure the success depends upon them. Do not say, I am not responsible; I shall have nothing to do in this meeting. If you feel thus, you are giving Satan opportunity to work through you. He will crowd your mind with his thoughts, giving you something to do in his lines. Instead of gathering with Christ, you will scatter abroad.",
