    "word": "A Power for Good--The apostle, seeing the inclination to abuse the gift of speech, gives direction concerning its use. \"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,\" he says, \"but that which is good to the use of edifying.\" The word \"corrupt\" means here any word that would make an impression detrimental to holy principles and undefiled religion, any communication that would eclipse the view of Christ, and blot from the mind true sympathy and love. It includes impure hints, which, unless instantly resisted, lead to great sin. Upon everyone is laid the duty \n                                                                           19\nof barring the way against corrupt communications. . . .",
