    "word": "Jesus said, \"Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.\" There are many today pursuing a similar course. \n                                                                           47\nIn the testimonies are specified the very sins of which they are guilty; hence they have no desire to read them. There are those who from their youth up have received warning and reproofs through the testimonies; but have they walked in the light and reformed?--Not at all. They still indulge the same sins; they have the same defects of character. These evils mar the work of God, and make their impress upon the churches. The work the Lord would do to set the churches in order is not done, because the individual members-and especially the leaders of the flock--would not be corrected.",
