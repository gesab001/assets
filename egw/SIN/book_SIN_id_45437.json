    "word": "I spoke again to the people this afternoon at half-past two. The house was full and more than half were unbelievers, but they listened with intense earnestness. The Lord gave me strength to speak with great earnestness and power one hour and a half. I feel to praise the Lord that He is renewing my strength and enabling me to bear the message He has given me. Oh, for the baptism of the Holy Ghost! I want the people to have it. They need it. We want rich blessings from the Lord in order to represent Christ to the people.
