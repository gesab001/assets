    "word": "This is quite an old place and the inhabitants are of the most intelligent class of people. The country around here is a good farming community, and this seems to be an enterprising place. There are twelve thousand inhabitants. They have here a rapidly running river from which are taken many fish. There are most beautiful parks, roads nicely laid out, and seats to accommodate all classes. It is the practice of W. C. W. and myself to walk in the parks about nine o'clock. The sun sets about half after nine, and at half past ten we can write by daylight. It is now midsummer. Yesterday there were seen standards beautifully decorated and all kinds of trees and branches of trees, flowers, and shrubs borne by our window in preparation for the morrow, which is a holiday. This midsummer day they observe day and night in the groves with entertainments and amusements and decorations, as the Fourth of July is celebrated in America. No business is done today. \n\n\n                                     -398-",
