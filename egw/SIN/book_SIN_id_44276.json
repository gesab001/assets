    "word": "MR No. 1409 - Jots and Tittles II\n\n     Dishonesty Among Canvassers. The work of colporteurs and canvassers is an important work. It is no child's play. Some have engaged in canvassing for other books than those bearing on present truth. They had a very low standard of righteousness and honesty. Because they professed to be Christians they were trusted. Confidence was placed in them because they professed to be Seventh-day Adventists, and it was not thought necessary to place them under regulations.",
