    "word": "Captain Eldridge's influence over you has not been right in some things. Your influence with him might have been much more to his good and the glory of God than it has been. But the past, with its burden of record, has gone into eternity; now in repentance and confession and conversion to God, in childlike submission and obedience to His will, is your only hope of salvation. I am deeply in earnest; I could not abate one jot or tittle of truth to please you or to make you my best friend. No; it is life or death \n                                                                           1072\nwith you. There is not time for us to trifle with eternal realities. We must be saved in God's way, just as He has presented it in His Word, else we can never be saved at all. We must be pure and single-hearted, in principle firm as a rock. Jesus said, \"He that will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me; so shall he be My disciple.\" Thank God, Oh, thank Him with heart and voice, that He is still our compassionate Redeemer, ready to forgive sin and by His own blood to cleanse us from every stain that sin has made. I write in love. (Signed) Aunt Ellen.--Letter 2a, 1892. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. November 1984 Entire Letter",
