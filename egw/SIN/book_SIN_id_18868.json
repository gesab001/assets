    "word": "MOSES PRAYED FOR MERCY FOR ISRAEL.\u2014Moses now arose and entered the tabernacle. The Lord declared to him, \u201cI will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation.\u201d But again Moses pleaded for his people. He could not consent to have them destroyed, and he himself made a mightier nation. Appealing to the mercy of God, he said: \u201cI beseech Thee, let the power of my Lord be great according as Thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy. . . . Pardon, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.\u201d",
