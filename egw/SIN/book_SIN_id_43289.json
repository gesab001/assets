    "word": "I have been praying most earnestly for wisdom to place in print the very things that, should I not live, will be a help and strength to those \n\n\n                                   -130- \n\nwho will be pleased to use them. My heart is filled with thanksgiving and praise. Heaven is full of richest blessings to bestow upon all who need these precious blessings, if they ask the Lord with heart and soul, and have a strong desire to receive to impart. The Lord Jesus has passed through every temptation that human beings have had. We read that He \"knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations,\" for He hath been \"in all points tempted like as we are\"--tempted in His human nature that He might know how to succor those who shall be tempted.",
