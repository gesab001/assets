    "word": "Let us as a people who have had great light remember that Christ sits among His people as a refiner and purifier of silver. He is continually cleansing the hearts of those who engage in His service as workers together with God. He will work through every soul. He is continually cleansing the hearts of those who are willing to be cleansed, separating the pure from the impure.--Letter 195, 1899, p. 5. (To \"Dear Brethren Colcord, Starr, and Hickox,\" November 29, 1899.)",
