    "word": "Fresno Church Encouraged to Take Special Offering for Refuge for Jewish Converts.-- I was much pleased to have some conversation with Elder [F.C.] Gilbert and his wife. What he told me of his work was very interesting. I believe that if he will hold on patiently his work for the Jewish people will be successful. I greatly desired to help him with money in properly fitting up the place he has purchased. I wish the church at Fresno might be induced to make an offering to his work, that the Jews who accept Christ, and because of this are cut off from their people, may have a place of refuge. Elder Gilbert is using his God-given powers in a noble work. I pray that through his efforts many of the seed of Israel may be grafted into the true stock, Christ Jesus. . . .",
