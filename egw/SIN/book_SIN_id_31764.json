    "word": "Let none of you feel that you are above temptation, that you have good principles, and need fear nothing from yourselves or the work which you have to do. Be jealous of yourselves. You need to humble your hearts constantly before God, that human depravity shall not neutralize your work. Do not cultivate habits of singularity, but obtain Christ's mould every day you live. Study the Pattern.",
