    "word": "Every one whom the Lord calls should be distrustful of self, and have full trust in God. Moses went forth in the name of \"I AM THAT I AM,\" without outward display of grandeur; yet the rod in his hand was a symbol of the divine power of Jehovah, and Moses was the instrumentality through whom God would deliver Israel from the bondage of tyranny. There is a work that must be done now by the children of God. For long years the colored race has been neglected, has been left in the slavery of sin, and they are as sheep that have no shepherd.
