    "word": "We are transgressors of God's law. Our only hope for salvation was in Christ taking upon Himself the guilt of our sins, bearing the penalty of transgression in His own body on the tree. He made a full oblation of sacrifice, and by that one oblation of Himself made it possible for us to live in obedience to God's commands. . . . We are to become His loyal subjects, having pure and undefiled religion, and depending upon the one grand principle, \"By grace are ye saved through faith.\" . . .",
