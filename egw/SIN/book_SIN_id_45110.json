    "word": "I speak this night and must say good-bye. Forgive this short letter. We have two small tents pitched under a large tent. Thus all are comfortable. Sister Harris prepares meals for us and for Brother Alfred \n\n\n                                     -320- \n\nOlsen, Brother Goodrich, Brother Morrison who came from California to educate in canvassing, and Brother Ramsey. This constitutes our party. We have a cool breeze blowing through our tent all the time. I am so thankful I can eat tomatoes, green corn, sweet potatoes, bananas, blackberries, huckleberries. We live real well.",
