    "word": "The work of sanctification begins in the heart, and we must come into such a relation with God that Jesus can put His divine mold upon us. We must be emptied of self in order to give room to Jesus, but how many have their hearts so filled with idols that they have no room for the Redeemer of the world. The world holds the hearts of men in captivity. They center their thoughts and affections upon their business, their position, their family. They hold to their opinions and ways, and cherish them as idols in the soul. . . . We must be emptied of self. But this is not all that is required, for when we have renounced our idols, the vacuum must be supplied. . . .",
