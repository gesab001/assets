    "word": "The work of saving the children must begin in the home. If the mother has a hasty temper, she should seek earnestly to overcome it. Let her remember that she is not to provoke her children to wrath. By exercising patience under trial, she may be the means of bringing her children under the influence of the Spirit of God, so that they may respond to it. The father and the mother are responsible for the maintenance of religion in the home.",
