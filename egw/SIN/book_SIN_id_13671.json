    "word": "\"The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of his testament\" (Revelation 11:19). The ark of God's testament is in the Holy of Holies, the second apartment of the sanctuary. In the ministration of the earthly tabernacle, which served \"unto the example and shadow of heavenly things,\" this apartment was opened only upon the great Day of Atonement for the cleansing of the sanctuary. Therefore the announcement that the temple of God was opened in heaven and the ark of His testament was seen points to the opening of the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary in 1844 as Christ entered there to perform the closing work of the atonement.",
