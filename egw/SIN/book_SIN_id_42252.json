    "word": "In His Son God has placed before the human agent the life he is to live. It is not for him to be constantly branching out in lines of his own choosing, and placing his will against the power of the will of God. Yet \n\n\n                                    -235- \n\nmany are expending their God-given powers in hopeless pursuit of things they can never attain. How different are the lives of such when compared with that of their Example, who for their sakes pledged Himself to a life of self-denial, of poverty, and of suffering, unappreciated, unacknowledged, despised, and rejected. Christ was often weary and hungry, and filled with sorrow in the consciousness of unrequited love. The nation whom He came to save and bless did not realize His mission. They had departed from God, and were constantly misunderstanding and misinterpreting Him. [John 1:11; Isaiah 53:3, 5, 7, quoted.]",
