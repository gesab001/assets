    "word": "Thursday morning, Sara came to my room, and told me it was time to go to the early meeting. I had been writing since three o'clock. I attended the meeting, and spoke for about three-quarters of an hour, and then there was a testimony meeting. I could not hear what was said, but I was told that it was an interesting meeting. In all my talks I have tried to present Christ as our wisdom, our sanctification, and our righteousness. \n\n\n                                   (Signed) Ellen G.
