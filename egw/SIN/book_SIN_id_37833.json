    "word": "\"Again, losses occur from lack of thoughtful care in the use of material and machinery. There is a failure to look after all the larger and smaller matters, that nothing be wasted or damaged through neglect. A little squandered here and there amounts to a large sum in the course of a year. Some have never learned to exercise their faculties to save the remnants, notwithstanding the injunction of Christ, 'Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.' Material should not be slashed into, to obtain a small piece. A little thoughtful care would lead to the gathering up and using of the little pieces that are now \n\n\n                      -37- \n\nthrown aside and wasted. Attention should be given to saving even so trifling a matter as waste paper, for it can be turned into money.",
