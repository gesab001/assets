    "word": "The sentiments of unbelief that were expressed after the judgments of God had come, showed that some would keep up their rebellion until the hour of God's patience is exhausted. Those who have acted as the Gentiles act, will be punished as the Gentiles, only with as much greater severity as the abundance of light given them makes their sin against God the greater. He will not spare, neither will He have mercy, unless there is a thorough conversion of soul, and that repentance which needeth not to be repented of.",
