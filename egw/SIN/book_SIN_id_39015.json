    "word": "A thousand times more work for God might be accomplished if all His children would fully consecrate themselves to Him, using their talents aright. If they would improve every opportunity for doing good, doors for service would be opened before them. They would be called to bear greater responsibilities. Let all ask of God, and they will receive wisdom to carry on His work under the ministration of the Holy Spirit. As they receive God's blessing, they will rejoice in the work.--Unpublished MS. \n                                                                           17",
