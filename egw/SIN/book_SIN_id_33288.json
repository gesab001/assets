    "word": "\"Why beholdest thou the mote that is in \n thy brother's eye?\" Matthew 7:3. \n\n\n     Even the sentence, \"Thou that judgest doest the same things,\" does not reach the magnitude of his sin who presumes to criticize and condemn his brother. Jesus said, \"Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\"",
