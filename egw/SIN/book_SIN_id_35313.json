    "word": "The promise of the gift of the Holy Spirit is not comprehended as it should be; the privileges to be enjoyed through its acceptance are not appreciated as they might be. God desires that His church should lay hold by faith upon His promises, and ask for the power of the Holy Spirit to help them in every place. He assures us that He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those that ask Him, than parents are to give good gifts unto their children. Since it is possible for everyone to have the heavenly unction, \"ye need not that any man teach you\" (1 John 2:27), and there is no excuse for shunning responsibilities; no duty should be unwelcome, no obligation evaded. Christ Himself is the renewing power, working in and through every soldier by the agency of the Holy Spirit. The efficiency of the Spirit of God will make effective the labors of all who are willing to submit to His guidance.",
