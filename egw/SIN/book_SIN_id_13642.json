    "word": "Christ was crucified for our sins, and was raised from the rent sepulcher for our justification; and He proclaims in triumph, \"I am the resurrection, and the life.\" Jesus lives as our intercessor to plead before the Father. He has carried the sins of the whole world, and has not made one mortal man a sin-bearer for others. No man can bear the weight of his own sins. The crucified One bore them all, and every soul who believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.",
