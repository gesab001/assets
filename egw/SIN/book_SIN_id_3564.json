    "word": "There are those who profess holiness, who declare that they are wholly the Lord's, who claim a right to the promises of God, while refusing to render obedience to His commandments. These transgressors of the law claim everything that is promised to the children of God; but this is presumption on their part, for John tells us that true love for God will be revealed in obedience to all His commandments. It is not enough to believe the theory of truth, to make a profession of faith in Christ. . . . \"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,\" John wrote, \"is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" . . .",
