    "word": "MR No. 392 - James White Biographical Items\n\n     Henry's health is good. Edson is not very well. Baby seems to be in perfect health. He is a great fat boy. Is three months and a half old and he weighs 17 pounds. He is good natured, seldom cries, is very playful and active. He has but one fault, that is, he is afraid of singing. My health is quite good for me. But James, poor James, I think he must leave the work sometimes and have quiet rest. I fear at times his life will fall a sacrifice to his incessant labors. I ask again your prayers. I do want to see you very much. I have about as much as I can do to take care of my three children. You have seen Henry, well Edson has more life and roughery than Henry so you must know my hands are full.--Letter 5, 1854, p. 1. (To \"Dear Brethren and Sisters,\" December 16, 1854.)",
