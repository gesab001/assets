    "word": "If you have Christ abiding there, you cannot fret or scold. You cannot make others unhappy and wretched and miserable. No. Because Christ is there, His joy is there, His peace is there. You want everybody to have peace; you want them to have comfort; you want them to have good hope; you want them to have courage, and you keep talking of Jesus and His love--what He has done for me. Now we lose sight of this; we lose sight of it. You look and see what Christ has done for you again and again, and the precious victories He has given you, and then as you look at things you talk of these. Don't you see, every trial sinks into insignificance in comparison with this?",
