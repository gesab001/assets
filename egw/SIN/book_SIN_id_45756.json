    "word": "Oh God, we want raiment without a spot; we want garments without a stain; we want a preparation to do a grand, a great, a holy work that must be done. We pray Thee that Thou wouldst work mightily, so that the salvation of God shall be revealed. Thou hast a whole heaven of blessing that Thou art waiting to pour out upon a people who are ready to receive it, and use it. Oh, all heaven is full of Thy graciousness and Thy pardon, which we may receive abundantly if we will only come to Thee and repent and be converted.",
