    "word": "\"In the year that king Uzziah died,\" says Isaiah, \"I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.\" Beholding this grand and glorious representation, the prophet discerned his own imperfections and those of the people with whom \n                                                                           170\nhe dwelt. \"Woe is me!\" he said, \"for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.\" O, how many who are engaged in this work of responsibility need to behold God as did Isaiah; for in the presence of his glory and majesty self will sink into nothingness. \n     Melbourne, Feb. 10, 1894. \n\n                                               -",
