    "word": "In Washington and at Mountain View, our brethren should study diligently the warnings that have been given of the evil results of centering the publishing work, and other interests, too largely in one place. God is not pleased with the influence that results from such centralization. If \n\n144 \n\nall the men who gather thus in one place are wise, experienced men who walk humbly with God, then the world needs these men to stand as the Lord's representatives in many places. We are to seek the honor and glory of God in all things. We have been losing time in Washington and in Mountain View by centering so much in these places.--Lt 164, 1909.",
