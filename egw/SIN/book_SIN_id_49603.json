    "word": "\"The advice that was given to Moses when he was overburdened with cares and perplexities, is of the highest value today to those who are in positions of responsibility in God's cause. The counsel given him should be carefully studied by those entrusted with the management of the work in the Lord's vineyard. No one man or set of men is to have supreme authority to shape and to control the policy of the workers in the entire field, even with respect to the canvassing work; for every section of the country, especially the Southern field, which has been so long neglected, has its peculiar features, and must be worked accordingly. Let men be willing to understand these features and in their work for these fields prepare themselves by putting on every piece of the Christian armor, not forgetting to wear the gospel shoes.\" \n\n\n     The apostle says: -- (Quoted, Ephesians 6:11-18.)",
