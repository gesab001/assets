    "word": "Do not be afraid to be found on your knees acknowledging God as your Father. Acknowledge your dependence upon God. Acknowledge that you are acquainted with His power, that you want a vital connection with the God of heaven. \"Well,\" you say, \"they misinterpret me, and if I am in the world I must be of the world.\" No, that does not necessarily follow. Christ says, \"Ye are the light of the world\" (Matthew 5:14). \"Let your light so shine that they may see your good works\" (see Matthew 5:16), and let them see that you are turning your eyes upon heaven. But it is not the fashion, and I am so sorry that it is not the fashion.",
