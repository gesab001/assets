    "word": "One of Christ\u2019s last commands to His disciples was \u201cLove one another as I have loved you.\u201d John 13:34. Do we obey this command, or are we indulging sharp, unchristlike traits of character? If we have in any way grieved or wounded others, it is our duty to confess our fault and seek for reconciliation.
