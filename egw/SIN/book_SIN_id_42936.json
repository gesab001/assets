    "word": "There are young people whose home influences have been such that it would be greatly to their advantage to live for a time in a well regulated school home. And for those who live where they must of necessity leave their own homes in order to enjoy school privileges, the school homes are a great blessing. But the parental home where God is feared and obeyed, is, and ever should be, the best place for young children where, under the proper training of their parents, they may enjoy the care and discipline of a religious family, administered by their own parents.",
