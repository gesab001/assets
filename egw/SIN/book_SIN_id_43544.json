    "word": "About two weeks after the Toowoomba meeting the camp meeting in Maitland will commence. Maitland is a place of over 20,000 people, twenty-two miles west of Newcastle, and twenty-eight miles northwest of Cooranbong. The instruction given to me about our work has been that we should as rapidly as possible present the truth in the various suburbs of Newcastle and also in all the towns along the railway line from Newcastle to Brisbane. Maitland is a rich farming district and is the center of a large stock raising district. If we are successful in securing proper help we hope with the blessing of God to have a rich harvest of souls there, some of whom will go forth to work for others.",
