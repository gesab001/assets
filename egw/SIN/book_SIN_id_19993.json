    "word": "A legal religion is insufficient to bring the soul into harmony with God. . . . The only true faith is that which \"worketh by love\" (Galatians 5:6) to purify the soul. It is as leaven that transforms the character. . . . Jesus proceeded to show His hearers what it means to keep the commandments of God--that it is a reproduction in themselves of the character of Christ. For in Him, God was daily made manifest before them.--Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 51-55.",
