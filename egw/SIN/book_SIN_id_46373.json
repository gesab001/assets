    "word": "We can see many of our sisters who know how to crochet fine articles for their houses. Now, what if they would spend their time in earnest prayer to God and the study of His Word that He would help them to have heavenly wisdom to know how to save the souls of those around them? It looks to me as though this kind of work is hay, wood, and stubble, of substances that are consumable and perishable; but the work that they might do in cleansing their own household and working for their neighbors would present lasting results of good. And if they were interested in this work they might be sowing seeds of truth. We must sow beside all waters, and we do not know which shall prosper, this or that. But the first work is a personal consecration to God.",
