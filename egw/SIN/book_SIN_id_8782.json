    "word": "The condition of being received into the Lord's family is coming out from the world, separating from all its contaminating influences. The people of God are to have no connection with idolatry in any of its forms. They are to reach a higher standard. We are to be distinguished from the world, and then God says, \"I will receive you as members of My royal family, children of the heavenly King.\" As believers in the truth we are to be distinct in practice from sin and sinners. Our citizenship is in heaven.",
