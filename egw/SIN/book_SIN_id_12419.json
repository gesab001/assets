    "word": "Christ came to bring salvation within the reach of all. . . . The most erring, the most sinful, were not passed by; His labors were  especially for those who most needed the salvation He came to bring. The greater their need of reform, the deeper was His interest, the  greater His sympathy, and the more earnest His labors. His great  heart of love was stirred to its depths for the ones whose condition was most hopeless and who most needed His transforming grace.",
