    "word": "In giving Christ, God gave heaven's choicest gift. He has given us all the rich blessings presented in the Word. When Christ ascended to heaven, the Holy Spirit took His place, and was a perfect representation of Him. It is the work of the Spirit to minister the richest grace, and make it effectual in the hearts of God's people, that the elect may be gathered into one family. We need more quiet, abiding trust in God, and then the very best and highest activities will be put forth. Not one false movement will be made. We need to cultivate a calm and obedient trust in God. To young and old, this is worth more than tongue can tell.",
