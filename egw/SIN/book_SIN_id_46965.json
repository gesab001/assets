    "word": "Sister Austin from Vermont called, and I visited with her for about two hours. These things occupied my time. Then there was the packing to leave next day for Bushnell, Michigan. We studied up the route and learned that we would have to wait in Lansing eight hours. Our only course was to take the early morning train at five a.m. We also learned that we could go by the way of Jackson and it cost one dollar or one dollar and a half more. We decided to save the money and go direct to Lansing.",
