    "word": "THIS LETTER BRINGS INTO FOCUS THE THOUGHT \n     OF RESPONSIBILITY TO PARENTS. IT IS CLEAR THAT \n     HANS IS TRYING TO URGE HIMSELF UPON THE \n     GIRL, AGAINST THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF HER \n     PARENTS, AND WITHOUT CONCERN FOR THEIR \n     FEELINGS AT ALL. THIS SITUATION RAISES THE \n     QUESTION OF WHETHER PARENTS SHOULD BE \n     CONSIDERED IN THE PROCESS OF CHOOSING A \n     WIFE. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SUCH A MARRIAGE \n     AS FAR AS RELATIONS WITH THEM ARE \n     CONCERNED? ELLEN WHITE POSES SUCH \n     CONSEQUENCES WORTH CONSIDERING. \n                                                                           47",
