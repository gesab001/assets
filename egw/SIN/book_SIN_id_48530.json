    "word": "Choosing a Leader \n\n     Christ died that man might not be bound hopelessly to Satan's chariot as the trophies of his victory. Who then will link with Satan? Who will choose to wear his badge? Who will choose him as their leader, refusing to stand under a banner stained with the blood of the Captain of their salvation? Christ died for every son and daughter of Adam. It was for us He manifested this amazing love. How can the subjects of His love be indifferent, standing in sin and disobedience, refusing to confess Christ? How can they love to do evil? How can they prostitute their reasoning faculties, and place their influence on Satan's side? By doing this they weaken their moral power and efficiency, instead of strengthening every faculty to do the will of Him who so loved the world \n                                                                           83\nthat He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.",
