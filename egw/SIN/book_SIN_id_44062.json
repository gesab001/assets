    "word": "There is need that men be set apart for the ministry; but unless there is a close seeking of the Lord to know His will, men who are unprepared will be set apart for the ministry. No man must be chosen because of his prepossessing appearance. Saul, who was designated as king of Israel, was a man of prepossessing appearance, tall and well proportioned. But neither in experience nor character was he fitted for the work. The Lord changed his heart through the operation of His Spirit, making him a converted man. The effect of divine grace upon the heart was accompanied by a visible change in his spirit. This gave him influence with the armies of Israel. Now he is set in the work aright. If he will cultivate humility and the fear of God, if he will trust in God, and learn His will, and not exalt himself, the Lord will give him grace.",
