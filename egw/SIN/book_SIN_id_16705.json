    "word": "The people of Israel were at this time loyal to God; and so long as they continued in obedience to His law, no power in earth or hell could prevail against them. But the curse which Balaam had not been permitted to pronounce against God\u2019s people, he finally succeeded in bringing upon them by seducing them into sin. When they transgressed God\u2019s commandments, then they separated themselves from Him, and they were left to feel the power of the destroyer.",
