    "word": "The Lord accepts no such transactions; prosperity will not attend these moves. Men connected with His work have been dealing unjustly, and is time to call a halt.

False propositions are assumed as truth and righteousness, and then everything is worked in such a way as to carry out these propositions, which are not in accordance with the will of God, but are a misrepresentation of His character.",
