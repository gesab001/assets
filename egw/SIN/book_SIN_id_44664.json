    "word": "Passing Truckee, [THIS PROBABLY SHOULD READ \"CHEYENNE.\" MRS. WHITE DID NOT WRITE THE LETTER AT ONE SITTING, AND AT TIMES FLASHED BACK TO DESCRIBE EARLIER EVENTS.] we entered snow sheds. From light to darkness and from darkness to light was the only change for miles. I had been growing stronger as I neared Colorado. We entered one hour before Cheyenne. We were telegraphed, soon after leaving Omaha, for seats in the car for California, and our seats were assigned us just as we were located in the car we left; therefore, it is always best to secure good seats in the palace car from Omaha, for that secures you good seats all the trip. Now the tickets have to be purchased at the ticket office before your baggage can be taken into the car. We are all settled some time before the sun has passed out of sight beyond the mountains.",
