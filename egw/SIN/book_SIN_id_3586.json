    "word": "Eve had overstated the words of God's command. He had said to Adam and Eve, \"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\" In Eve's controversy with the serpent, she added \"Neither shall ye touch it.\" Here the subtlety of the serpent appeared. This statement of Eve gave him advantage; he plucked the fruit and placed it in her hand, using her own words, He hath said, If ye touch it, ye shall die. You see no harm comes to you from touching the fruit, neither will you receive any harm by eating it.",
