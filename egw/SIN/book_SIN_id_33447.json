    "word": "Let none mourn that they have not larger talents to use for the Master. While you are dissatisfied and complaining, you are losing precious time and wasting valuable opportunities. Thank God for the ability you have, and pray that you may be enabled to meet the responsibilities that have been placed upon you. If you desire greater usefulness, go to work and acquire what you mourn for. Go to work with steady patience, and do your very best, irrespective of what others are doing. \u201cEvery one of us shall give account of himself to God.\u201d Let not your thought or your words be \u201cO that I had a larger work! O that I were in this or that position!\u201d",
