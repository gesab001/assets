    "word": "The self-righteous feel no need of Christ. And when those who profess His name extol their own wisdom and goodness, they give evidence that they are not acquainted with Him. As soon as Christ is revealed to the soul, the sinner feels that his only hope is in the Lamb of God as the propitiation for sin. As Christ begins to open His love before him watch the effect, and see what it is. Many claim this experience who are strangers to the love of Christ. But if it leads one to look with humility upon himself, . . . if he gives evidence that the heavenly reward is of more value to him than his worldly possessions, we may know that beams of life from Christ are shining upon his soul.",
