    "word": "Is the work that has been going on since the Minneapolis meeting of God? If not, it is of another spirit. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" I know that the Lord is in this work, and no one can silence the messenger whom God sends, or repress the message. The Lord will be heard through his human agencies. And if any man refuses to accept the light and walk in it, that light will not continue to shine upon him. \"I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works: or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\"",
