    "word": "Brother Sutherland thought that perhaps he ought to return to Berrien Springs immediately upon reaching Nashville after this trip; but we do not think that this would be wisdom. Early next week we have an important meeting to attend at Huntsville, and it is very important that our brethren should be at that meeting; for decisions are to be made as to what shall be done with the Huntsville school. The future of this school is hanging in the balance. And if Brother Sutherland and Brother Magan are to work in the South, they should have every opportunity to understand the outlook, and to see the probabilities and possibilities of the work here. I do not think \n\n\n                                      -267- \n\nthat they should return to Berrien Springs before visiting Huntsville with us. I wish to talk with them more than I have. I have not been able to talk with them much since they came; for I have been quite ill. The labor at the Berrien Springs meeting was all that I could endure, and I have been feeling the consequences. I am sure that Brother Magan and Brother Sutherland ought to be at the Huntsville meeting. We must all consult together, and decide important matters. Our brethren are to be on the ground, and they must not rush away until some matters are settled. They must know what the Lord would have them do.--Letter 193, 1904, pp. 1, 2. (To Mrs. Druillard, June 9, 1904.)",
