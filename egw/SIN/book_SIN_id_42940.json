    "word": "I have had presented before me Brother Sutherland's danger in hearing the testimonies and your lessons upon teaching the Bible alone and listening to the voice of nature, which teaches beautiful lessons. If we follow on to know the Lord, we shall see things more clearly than we discern them now. But neither teachers nor students are prepared to make rapid changes. We need the baptism of the Holy Spirit, else minds will misinterpret the subjects and handle them in such a way as to bring confusion rather than light. As you shall go into the study of opening the Scriptures to the schools, do not introduce the matter of simple books being discarded. It will do harm to the uninformed, who, half catching at things, and supposing they know it all, yet utterly unable as teachers to understand the matter in all its bearings, will advance theories which one and another will grasp at but will not understand. Brother Sutherland is making a mistake. Please be guarded. The subjects you have long studied will in Brother Sutherland's hand be carried to extremes, and in the present state of things this will result in matters which we cannot handle or adjust.",
