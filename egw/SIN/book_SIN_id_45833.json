    "word": "\"Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\" Well, every man can have that hope. We have it, then what should we do? Is it every man that professeth to have the hope? No, there are those who talk about it, but they have not the love of Jesus and are in a worse condition than the unbeliever. They understand, but do they hold themselves as the light of the world? What is it to be a light to the world?--It is to recognize Christ as our example. It is to show Christian politeness, never to scold and fret, but to be in a condition where we can constantly carry the minds of others upward. This is the work of everyone who names the name of Christ. It is to depart from the works of iniquity; it is to wash our garments in the blood of the Lamb. We are in the washing and ironing time. Now we are to have every sin and iniquity taken \n\n\n                -53- \n\nfrom us, and the white linen put upon us, the wedding garment.",
