    "word": "I am pained at heart, when I call to mind how many children of Sabbath-keeping parents are ruining soul and body with this vice. There is a family near you who reveal their evil habits in their bodies as well as their minds. S. B. Warrens' children are on the direct road to perdition. They are debased. They have instructed very many in this vice. The eldest boy is dwarfed, physically and mentally, through indulging in the practice of this degrading vice. What little intellect he has left is of a low order. If he continues in this vicious practice he will eventually \n                                                                           19\nbecome idiotic. Every indulgence of children who have attained their growth, is a terrible evil, and will produce its terrible results, enervating the system, and weakening the intellect. But in those who indulge this corrupting vice before attaining their growth, the evil effects are more plainly marked, and recovery from the effects of such sinful indulgence more nearly hopeless. The frame is weak and stunted; the muscles are flabby; the eyes become small, and appear at times swollen; the memory is treacherous, the inability to concentrate the thoughts upon study increases; the memory becomes sieve-like. To the parents of these children, I would say, you have brought children into the world which are only a curse to society. Your children are unruly, passionate, quarrelsome, and vicious. Their influence upon others is corrupting. These children bear the stamp of the baser passions of the father. The stamp of his character is placed upon his children. His hasty, violent temper is reflected in his children. These parents should have long ago removed to the country, separating themselves and children from the society of those they could not benefit, but only harm.",
