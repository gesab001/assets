    "word": "God has given to man abundantly. He says, \"I will lend you those goods of mine to trade upon; but I will require you to return to me the tenth of all your increase.\" Through Moses directions had been given how the Lord's talents of means should be appropriated; and again in Malachi this instruction is repeated. With all the blessings that the Lord bestows upon man, he tells him how they are to be used; and in obedience to his will there is safety and security. But when men set up their own ideas and plans, and do what God has forbidden with the talents he has entrusted to them, he counts them as \"disobedient, unthankful, unholy.\"",
