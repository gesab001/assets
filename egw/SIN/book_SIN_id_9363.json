    "word": "The long-suffering of God is wonderful. Long does justice wait while mercy pleads with the sinner. But \"righteousness and judgment are the establishment of his throne\" (Psalm 97:2, margin). . . . The world has become bold in transgression of God's law. Because of His long forbearance, men have trampled upon His authority. . . . But there is a line beyond which they cannot pass. The time is near when they will have reached the prescribed limit. Even now they have almost exceeded the bounds of the long-suffering of God, the limits of His grace, the limits of His mercy. The Lord will interpose to vindicate His own honor, to deliver His people, and to repress the swellings of unrighteousness. . . .",
