    "word": "Jesus sets no man as an intercessor or to receive confessions of sins. He calls every sinner into communication with Himself, without any mortal man to interpose between God and the sinner. Jesus will accept every soul who believes on His name, and He will cleanse him from all his moral defilement, if he believes on Him whom the Father hath sent into the world.",
