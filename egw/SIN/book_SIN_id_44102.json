    "word": "Selfishness is the root of all evil, making men bold, hardhearted, and inconsistent, and as if the religion of Jesus Christ has naught to do with the details of business life. A religion whose nature has not the influence to soften and subdue the words and the spirit, and bring into captivity even the thoughts to Jesus Christ, cannot have power to form the character, and therefore would not sanctify the soul. We must all consider, yea do much considering. \"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?\" [2 Corinthians 13:5].",
