    "word": "Peas can be planted in this country so as to be yielding nearly all the year round. I have been using tomatoes since New Year's until about two weeks ago. Squashes or pumpkins we have in abundance. Vegetables grow well on this land, but we have not raised many because the land was not prepared for them. Vegetables, fruit, and bread, form our table fare. As we are educating colonials in health principles, we do not, under any circumstances, place meat on the table. Some of our present company are as pupils in a school, and therefore precept and example must be harmonious. Each year we put up not less than six or eight hundred quarts of canned fruit. We have peaches, apricots, nectarines, grapes, plums, and tomatoes canned.",
