    "word": "If One Soul Endures, the Work Is a Success.--In the night season I was conversing with you. I had a message for you and was presenting that message. You were cast down and feeling discouraged. I said to you, The Lord has bidden me speak to Brother and Sister _____. I said you are considering your work as almost a failure, but if one soul holds fast to truth and endures unto the end, your work cannot be pronounced a failure. If one mother has been turned from her disloyalty to obedience, you may rejoice. The mother who follows on to know the Lord will teach her children to follow in her footsteps. The promise is to fathers, to mothers, and to their children. . . . \n                                                                           329",
