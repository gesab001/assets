    "word": "Nothing can do us real good without the blessing of God.  What God blesses is blessed.  Therefore \"a little that a righteous man hath is better that the riches of many wicked.\" Psalm 37:16.  The little with the blessing of God is more efficient, and it will extend farther.  The grace of God will make a little go a great ways.  When we devote ourselves to the affairs of the kingdom of God, He will mind our affairs.\"",
