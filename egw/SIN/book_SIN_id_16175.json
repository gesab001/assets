    "word": "The Holy Spirit was to descend on those who love Christ. By this they would be qualified, in and through the glorification of their Head, to receive every endowment necessary for the fulfilling of their mission.

The evidence of the enthronement of Christ in His mediatorial kingdom was given.",
