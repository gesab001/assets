    "word": "The blood of Christ, and of the disciples, whom they had put to death, was upon them, and in terrible judgments were they visited. The curse of God followed them, and they were a by-word and a derision to the heathen and to Christians. They were shunned, degraded and detested, as though the brand of Cain was upon them. Yet I saw that God marvelously preserved this people, and had scattered them over the world, that they might be looked upon as especially visited by a curse from God. I saw that God has forsaken the Jews as a nation; yet there was a portion of them who would be enabled to tear away the veil from their hearts. Some will yet see that prophecy has been  fulfilled concerning them, and they will receive Jesus as the Saviour of the world, and see the great sin of their nation in rejecting Jesus, and crucifying him. Individuals among the  Jews will be converted; but as a nation they are forever forsaken of God.",
