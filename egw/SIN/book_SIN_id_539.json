    "word": "The Selfish and Morose Husband.--Brother B is not of a temperament to bring sunshine into his family. Here is a good place for him to begin to work. He is more like a cloud than a beam of light. He is too selfish to speak words of approval to the members of his family, especially to the one of all others who should have his love and tender respect. He is morose, overbearing, dictatorial; his words are frequently cutting, and leave a wound \n                                                                           227\nthat he does not try to heal by softening spirit, acknowledging his faults, and confessing his wrongdoings. . . .",
