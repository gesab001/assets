    "word": "We need to guard faithfully the Lord's property, for any abuse of our powers shortens the time that our lives can be used for the glory of God. Bear in mind that we must consecrate all--soul, body, and spirit--to God. It is His purchased possession, and must be used intelligently, to the end that we may prolong and preserve the talent of life itself. By properly using our powers and talents to their fullest extent in the most useful employment, by keeping every organ in health to do the best and most useful service for God, by preserving every organ that body and mind, sinew and muscle, may work harmoniously, we may do the best and most precious service of God.",
