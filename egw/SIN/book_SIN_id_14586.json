    "word": "This is where the people of God make so many mistakes. They do not express thankfulness for the great gift of God's love and grace. Selfishness must be expelled from the soul. The heart must be purified from all envy, all evil surmising. Believers must constantly receive and impart the love of God. Then unbelievers will say of them, \"They have been with Jesus, and learned of Him. They are living in intimate companionship with Christ, who is love.\" The world has keenness of perception, and will take knowledge to some purpose of those who sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. The character of God's human agencies must be a transcript of the character of their Saviour. . . .",
