    "word": "The present spiritual condition of some of our church members who stand in high positions of responsibility, shows that in the future there must be a great change. God has no place in His mansions for lovers of deception, of fraud, of sin. In the beginning Satan prevailed on man to sin, and he is still carrying on his mischievous work. He puts forth efforts in our churches, and I call upon our people to be on their guard against him.",
