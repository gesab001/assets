    "word": "28 (1 Corinthians 11:25; see EGW on Leviticus 17:11). The Peace-making Cup.--The atoning sacrifice is full and sufficient. It is the new covenant, sealed with His blood, which was shed for many for the remission of sins. This Christ declared at the last supper. In this cup there is to those who drink in faith, peace-making, soul-cleansing efficacy. It is the balm of Gilead, which God has provided to restore health and soundness to the sin-stricken soul (Letter 108, 1899).",
