Begin your work every morning with prayer. The Lord says, \"Them that honour Me I will honour\" (1 Samuel 2:30). If you educate the workers in every department to invite the presence of the Lord Jesus, and begin the work with softened and subdued hearts, no loud-voiced ordering or sharp words will be heard. No harsh spirit will be manifested by men and women who believe that Christ is in the room. This is the reformation needed. The workers in every room are to be transformed into a Christian-endeavor company to help one another to please Christ by gentleness, good temper, and sunshine in the heart. Sweetness, gentleness, patience, longsuffering, love, and the strictest integrity must be manifested by those who stand at the head of every working force, because Christ is present, to see how His character is lived before the workmen. Every worker should feel that in his room angels preside, for Satan will seize every opportunity to weave in some of his sentiments and attributes.",
