    "word": "You have every reason for praising God for His loving kindness and tender mercy. His all-atoning blood is available to all your children. If you do not overtax your physical powers, you can in the name of Jesus do much precious work.... To you therefore which believe, He is precious.... Walk in love as dear children. The Spirit of God is striving with the children, inviting them to Christ, saying, \"Come; for all things are now ready\" (Luke 14:17). Will you not obey?--Letter 94, Jan. 31, 1895, to the widowed mother of a large family of adult children.",
