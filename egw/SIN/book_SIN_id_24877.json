    "word": "Men cannot with impunity reject the warnings which God in mercy sends them. A message was sent from Heaven to the world in Noah's day, and their salvation depended upon the manner in which they treated that message. Because they rejected the warning, the Spirit of God was withdrawn from that sinful race, and they perished in the waters of the flood. In the time of Abraham, mercy ceased to plead with the guilty inhabitants of Sodom, and all \n                                                                           271\nbut Lot with his wife and two daughters were consumed by the fire sent down from heaven. So in the days of Christ. The Son of God declared to the unbelieving Jews of that generation, \"Your house is left unto you desolate.\" [Matthew 23:38.] Looking down to the last days, the same infinite power declares, concerning those who \"received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,\" \"For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\" [2 Thessalonians 2:10-12.] As they reject the teachings of his word, God withdraws his Spirit, and leaves them to the deceptions which they love.",
