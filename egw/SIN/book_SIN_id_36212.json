    "word": "Since coming to this sanitarium, I have had opportunity to see a great deal of its surroundings. The forty acres of land, with the large buildings located on the property, are in the midst of the Middlesex Fells, a State reservation of three thousand five hundred acres. We have driven slowly through the park in every direction, looking with delight at the trees and the lakes, and inhaling the health-giving fragrance of the pines. It is delightful to ride through the forest. There are many beautiful drives, and much fine scenery. I enjoy looking at the many different kinds of trees, but most of all I enjoy looking at the noble pines. There are medicinal properties in the fragrance of these trees. \"Life, life,\" my husband used to say when riding among the pines. \"Breathe deep, Ellen; fill your lungs with the fragrant, life-giving atmosphere.\"",
