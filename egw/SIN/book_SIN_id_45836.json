    "word": "The God of heaven understood the case of Jacob better than he himself. In the night season he dreamed he saw a ladder whose base was planted firmly on earth, the topmost round of which reached to the highest heavens; and God was above it, shedding His glory all along that mystic ladder. And the angels were traversing that ladder, ascending and descending upon the Son of God. Now, we know that as Jacob went out from his father's house so discouraged, God was flashing light and encouragement onto his pathway. Read Genesis 28:12-17.",
