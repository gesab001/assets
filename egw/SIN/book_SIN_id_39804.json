    "word": "Narcotics, Introduction of, Into Foreign Lands by Christians, a Cause for Judgment.--The whole heathen world will rise up in judgment against those whom heaven has favored the most, but who have placed themselves on Satan's side, and worked in his lines to bring their soul-destroying narcotics to foreign lands, to pollute and destroy the heathen nations with their defiling and health-destroying drugs. For the sake of a revenue, a professedly Christian nation have forced their traffic upon the heathen nations at the point of the sword, and thus compelled them to accept their merchandise, \n\n\n                                     -342- \n\nwhich would in using degrade the people below the level of the brute creation.--Ms 49, 1897.",
