    "word": "How vastly different was the true High Priest from the false and corrupted Caiaphas. In comparison with Caiaphas, Christ stands out pure and undefiled, without a taint of sin. \"By one offering He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified\" [Hebrews 10:14]. This enabled Him to proclaim on the cross with a clear and triumphant voice, \"It is finished.\" [Hebrews 9:24-26; 10:12, quoted.] Christ entered in once into the holy place, \"having obtained eternal redemption for us\" [Hebrews 9:12]. \"Wherefore He is able \n\n\n                                    -393- \n\nalso to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them\" [Hebrews 7:25].",
