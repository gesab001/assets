    "word": "He who came from the heavenly courts on an embassage of love, mercy, and truth to save from sin the people that had been made the repositories of sacred truth, and to enlighten the world by the knowledge of God, was crucified. The One to whom the Jewish sacrifices pointed clothed His divinity with humanity, that humanity might become a teacher of humanity. He revealed Himself as the sent of God, the hope of Israel. He was the foundation of the whole Jewish economy. \"I find no fault in Him,\" was the testimony of an irreligious heathen judge. But Satan and his synagogue were leagued against divinity. Christ was rejected and dishonored as far as humanity and satanic agencies combined could do the shameful work. They chose a robber and a heathen king in the place of the Prince of Life. \"We have no king but Caesar,\" they shouted. Thus they withdrew from the divine theocracy, choosing a heathen ruler.",
