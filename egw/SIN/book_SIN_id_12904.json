    "word": "\u201cSunday morning we met with the brethren, and my husband arose to preach on the parable of the ten virgins. He had no freedom in speaking, and proposed that we have a season of prayer. We bowed before the Lord and engaged in earnest prayer. The dark cloud was lifted, and I was taken off in vision, and again shown the case of this woman. She was represented to me as being in perfect darkness. Jesus frowned upon her and her husband. That withering frown caused me to tremble. I saw that she had acted the hypocrite, professing holiness while her heart was full of corruption. After I came out of vision I related with trembling, yet with faithfulness, what I had seen. I was severely tried, and anxious for the people of God. Would those present believe the testimony? The woman put on a calm appearance \n267\nand said, \u2018I am glad the Lord knows my heart. He knows that I love him.\u2019 Then her husband rose in anger, and laying his hand on the Bible said, \u2018The Bible is all we want, I shall not give up the Bible for visions.\u2019 His wife affected to check him, saying, \u2018Don't, husband, dear, don't talk; the Lord knows me, and will take care of it all.\u2019 Then she vindicated herself, saying, \u2018If my heart could only be opened that you might see it.\u2019 I knew the minds of some were unsettled, whether to believe what the Lord had shown me, or let her appearance weigh against the testimony borne. Her appearance was perfectly calculated to gain their sympathy. But I had discharged a painful duty and God would take care of the result. At the close of the meeting she stated that she had no hard feelings against me, and that she should pray for me, and if I got to heaven I would see her there. We returned with Brother P.'s family, and that night the Lord met with us. I believed that the Lord would show his people the truth, and justify the vision. The neighbors said that I had abused the poor woman.",
