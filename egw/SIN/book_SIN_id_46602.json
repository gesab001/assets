    "word": "Misunderstanding, misapplication, of the truth will alienate the hearts of those who have been brethren. But this would not be if self and self-esteem, if customs and traditions, were not disturbed by the message of truth. Patience, moderation, self-control, and carefulness of speech should ever be cultivated and manifested.

Says the Word of God, \"Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgressions and the house of Jacob their sin.\" (Isaiah 58:1.)",
