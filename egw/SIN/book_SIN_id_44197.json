    "word": "We shall always feel indignation to have Christ insulted; but instead of reviling the revilers, it would please our heavenly Father to have us pray silently, and ask the Lord to touch the heart of him who is opposing the truth to the ruin of his own soul. The soul of him who opposes truth is as of much value with God as are our own souls. When we feel indignation, let us consider the fact that the opposer of truth has been purchased by the blood of the only begotten Son of God.",
