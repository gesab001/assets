    "word": "At times I feel the power of God, even in my flesh, and yet I am not satisfied. I want to plunge deeper and deeper in the ocean of God's love and be wholly swallowed up in Him. Be strong in God. Do not sink. My vision comes up before me and the words of the angel even now seem to ring in my ears, \"Get ready, get ready, get ready. Time is almost finished, almost finished, \n\n\n                                    -223- \n\nalmost finished. Cry, cry, for the arm of the Lord to be revealed, for the arm of the Lord to be revealed. Time is almost finished. What you do, ye must do quickly!\"--Letter 26, 1850, p. 2. (To Brother and Sister Loveland, November 1, 1850.)",
