    "word": "Need of Tact in Telling of the Saviour-- Wherever we are, we should watch for opportunities of speaking to others of the Saviour. If we follow Christ's example in doing good, hearts will open to us as they did to Him. Not abruptly, but with tact born of divine love, we can tell them of Him who is the \"Chiefest among ten thousand\" and the One \"altogether lovely.\" This is the very highest work in which we can employ the talent of speech. It was given to us that we might present Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour.--COL 339.",
