    "word": "It is the supposed little sins that will exclude us from heaven. We cannot carry with us a part of our sinful selves, that sensitiveness which is always ready to be hurt and cry out. Our refusal to let self die and our life be hid with Christ in God, will leave us in unbelief and transgression of the law. The gospel has not abolished the law, or detracted one tittle from its claims. It still demands holiness in every part. There is no such thing as making the law void through faith in Christ. The law is the echo \n\n\n                                    -302- \n\nof God's own voice, giving to every soul the invitation, Come up higher; be holy, holier still.",
