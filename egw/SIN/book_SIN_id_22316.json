    "word": "42, 43. Gabriel Strengthened Christ.--In the supreme crisis, when heart and soul are breaking under the load of sin, Gabriel is sent to strengthen the divine sufferer, and brace Him to tread His bloodstained path. And while the angel supports His fainting form, Christ takes the bitter cup, and consents to drink its contents. Before the suffering One comes up the wail of a lost and perishing world, and the words come from the blood-stained lips, \"Nevertheless, if man must perish unless I drink this bitter cup, Thy will, not Mine, be done\" (ST Dec. 9, 1897).",
