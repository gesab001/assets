    "word": "In Many Places.--As a means of overcoming prejudice and gaining access to minds, medical missionary work must be done, not in one or two places only, but in many places where the truth has not yet been proclaimed.

This work will break down prejudice as nothing else can.--Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 211. (1909)",
