    "word": "Then I remembered the words that had been spoken to me during the night season. It is the purpose of God that, if we take any of this property, we secure the whole. We must have control of the whole tract. The land must not be shared with men who would be at work on the Sabbath; for if this were done, we should find ourselves brought into a very unfavorable position. There must be no opportunity for unbelievers to locate near the school buildings or to keep a place where intoxicating liquors might be sold. We must have no persons on the ground who would claim a right to carry on their business as they pleased. The whole tract must be under our own supervision.",
