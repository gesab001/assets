    "word": "The Bible rules must be strictly followed. The matter concerning which a difference of opinion prevails should be calmly considered, with much prayer, with hearts yearning for unity, and with perfect love for one another's souls. Examine every point as if you could see the whole heavenly universe looking upon you. If there is positive evidence that one of the brethren is in error, try to convince him from the Word of God. If success should not crown your efforts, even then the world has no business with this matter, for it would only dishonor the God of truth and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.",
