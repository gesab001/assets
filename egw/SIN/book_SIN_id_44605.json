    "word": "Oh, that I could present before our people the great loss of heavenly treasure we are sustaining because our human faculties are not trained and disciplined according to the Word of the Lord to wrestle with hard problems in the search for divine truth. God designs that we shall possess a vivifying power to communicate these truths with the power of the Holy Spirit, and make these truths a blessing to the people. There are treasures in the great gift of God to human souls that might be discovered if there was more cultivated and earnest prayer, more simplicity and less formality. Greater spiritual knowledge would be given from the great Teacher and there would be less ignorance, if our souls were not high and lifted up in ourselves unto vanity.",
