    "word": "I am instructed to say that these words we may use as appropriate for this time, for the time has come when sin must be called by its right name.

But if these theories are received, they will lead to a denial of the truth that for the past fifty years God has been giving to His people, substantiating it by the demonstration of the Holy Spirit.",
