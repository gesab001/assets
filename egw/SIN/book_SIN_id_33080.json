    "word": "God requires every man to stand free, and to follow the directions of the Word. In every movement Christ's followers are to reveal their regard for Christian principles--loving God supremely, and their neighbors as themselves; reflecting light and blessing on the pathway of those who are in darkness; comforting those who are cast down; sweetening the bitter waters in the place of giving their fellow pilgrims gall to drink. . . . We are to have a pure, growing Christianity. In the heavenly courts we are to be pronounced complete in Christ.--Manuscript 83, Oct. 29, 1903, \"Christ Our Example in Medical Missionary Work.\"",
