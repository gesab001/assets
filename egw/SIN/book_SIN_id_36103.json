    "word": "I have written out fully the instruction that I was commissioned to give. We are now to take our individual selves in hand, and conquer the wicked feelings that rise in our hearts. In allowing the venom of these feelings to flow forth in words, we help Satan in his work. Our church-members need a reconversion, a renewal of the Holy Spirit's power to make them children of God, members of His family. Let every one in our churches now humble his own heart, confess his own sins, and remember that God has a controversy with those who have kept the work from advancing, by their crooked characters, which need to be made all over again.",
