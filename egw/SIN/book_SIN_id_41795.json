    "word": "The rocky mountains rise abruptly and seem to tower upwards reaching to the very heavens. At my left is a grand old castle standing upon the mountaintop, and in the distance rises another mountain far above. The peaks reach almost to the heavens--a mountain that to human eye appears inaccessible, rising thousands of feet above the level, and on the very summit is a tower. It may be for observation. The ambition of man will not be restricted. We come to scenery that appears to our senses as indescribably grand. Mountain peaks rise above mountain peaks, the massive, curiously splendid shaped rocks that were heaved up by mighty agencies and sculptured by the storms of ages.--Manuscript 62, 1886, pp. 26, 27.
