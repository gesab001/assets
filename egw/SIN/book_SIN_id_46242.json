    "word": "The root of the sin that is in our world is an unbelief in Christ and an unwillingness to accept the truths that He came into our world to proclaim. Sin has made us aliens from God. The first step toward restoration is obedience to words, \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with Me, and he shall make peace with Me.\" A belief in Christ as a personal Saviour is the only salvation provided for the sinner.",
