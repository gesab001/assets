    "word": "There is much loose work done everywhere, and the efforts that have been made for the few years past tend to put out the eyes that Israel shall not discern their defections, and God withholds His Spirit from them and darkness envelopes them as it did the Jewish nation. What we want most is not learning and eloquence and the mastery in debating, but heart power, prayer to God in faith for His converting power, thoroughgoing piety. Half-way converts abound; singleness in love for Jesus is rare. It is not brain power or purse power, but heart power that the people need now.",
