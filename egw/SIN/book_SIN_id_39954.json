    "word": "I am not surprised that as darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people, the light that comes from the Father of light is not discerned. Just to the extent that the mists and fogs encompass the minds of men, will be their ignorance and misconception of God. The worldly churches cannot read a \"Thus saith the Lord,\" in regard to the seventh-day Sabbath; and why? Because they are wise in their own conceits; because they are following the example of men who were only one step from the Eden of God, and who, because of their mental and moral capabilities, began to work out their human inventions, and worship the things their hands had made, supposing that they were improving upon God's plans and devices. In this they worshiped and extolled themselves.",
