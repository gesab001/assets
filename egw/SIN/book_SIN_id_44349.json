    "word": "You loved your Bible, and you loved to study it; it was precious to you, better than a collection of syllables and words. The Spirit of God is drawing you, and He will pardon your transgressing His commandments, which is a terrible dishonor to God and terrible against yourself. Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die? \"Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon\" [Isaiah 55:6-8].",
