    "word": "God has a great work to be accomplished in Africa, and no plans must be laid without the aid of His infinite wisdom. After your plans of labour have been talked over together, mingled with earnest prayer, work, work for Christ. Be not intimidated by apparent difficulties which threaten to obstruct your pathway. There is a right way to work, and God will direct you therein. If you labour in perfect unity, with unselfish interest, and brotherly love, angels of God will be with you. This is God's work, and He will make the rough places smooth, He will prepare the way before you. The work which is to be done in foreign countries can never be done by mortal man unaided by divine wisdom. You must look to the Captain for orders, and then obey without questioning. As you go forward in the strength of Israel's God, in simplicity and faith, the difficulties which Satan will magnify into mountains will become as mole hills. Workers can easily place \n26\nthemselves where divine love, power, and wisdom cannot reach them, where they cannot have help in counsel, in difficulties and trials, because they would not understand and rightly appropriate heaven's rich treasure. They would glorify themselves, and think their own ways perfect, and become established in self-righteousness. Man's wisdom is counted foolishness. When self is put entirely away, then you can obtain a new and rich experience, you will discern your own imperfections as you lie low at the foot of the cross, and as you view the perfections of Christ, self will sink into insignificance.",
