    "word": "The use of means in the sanitarium at Nashville should be considered in a Bible light, not a selfish light. Christian benevolence will lead to a study of the needs of every branch of the work, and a determination that each shall have its proper part. The time is passing, and the work of God in the earth will soon be accomplished. Upon the men who act a leading part in the various branches of the work a large degree of the Holy Spirit must rest in order that the work may be carried to completion in the Lord's own way. The Lord lives and reigns, and he has promised to guide his people with judgment if they will walk humbly with him.",
