    "word": "Resisting Temptation--1891.--Many seem to think that it is impossible not to fall under temptation, that they have no power to overcome, and they sin against God with their lips, talking discouragement and doubt, instead of faith and courage. Christ was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin. He said, \"The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.\" What does this mean? It means that the prince of evil could find no vantage ground in Christ for his temptation; and so it may be with us.--The Review and Herald, May 19, 1891.",
