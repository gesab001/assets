    "word": "Christ overlooked the world and all ages from the height of Olivet; and his words are applicable to every individual who slights the pleadings of his divine mercy. Scorner of his love, he addresses you today. It is \"thou, even thou,\" who shouldst know the things which belong to thy peace. The retribution of the sinner will be proportionate to the light which he has received.",
