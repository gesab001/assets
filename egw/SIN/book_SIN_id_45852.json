    "word": "There can be no careless disregard of His Word without the terrible consequence that always follows backsliding and neglect. Many have not the Spirit of Christ, and thus give evidence that they are none of His. And yet this very class is seeking to tell others how to be saved. There is need of humiliation of soul before God, need of confession of sins and restitution. There has been unbelief, there has been dishonesty. A spirit of murmuring has been communicated from one to another in the ranks of Sabbath-keepers. They do not discern spiritual things. Discouraging words have been spoken. Do not indulge this spirit, dear brethren and sisters. You please the enemy in so doing. You cannot afford to reap the harvest that will thus be produced.",
