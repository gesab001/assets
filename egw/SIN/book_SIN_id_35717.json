    "word": "Advice is asked of those in Battle Creek regarding matters which could just as well be settled by men on the ground, if they would seek the Lord, and which ought to have been done within their own borders. The Lord declares he is nigh to all that call upon him with a sincere heart. Said Christ, \n\n\n                    - 7 - \n\n\"Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" This promise is made doubly and trebly sure. There is no failure with God. Today men who are presidents of conferences are less efficient and strong and able than they should be, because they place man where God should be, and they receive only that which man can give them.",
