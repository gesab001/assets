    "word": "O, how much evil has been committed by placing a high estimate on human talent, when the possessor was unconsecrated unsanctified. All human talent is valueless before God until the superscription of Jesus is placed upon it. Then in and through Christ the possessor becomes an efficient agent for good because he has a living connection with God. When truth gets full possession of a man's conscience, it sanctifies the soul. All his sensibilities are aroused, his sympathies are not fitful. The light from the Sun of Righteousness shines into his heart, and he becomes a earnest, living representative of truth. It is not the most eloquent men or the so called great men in business matters that are essential but men who may be looked upon as having little talent, yet who are true, simple, humble great hearted men; these may attain to wide usefulness blessing humanity everywhere. Jesus says, \"Ye are the salt of the earth. Would that every man in the office of publication would practise the lesson taught by this symbol, and represent the saving salt. God is not deceived; he knows every grain of pure salt.",
