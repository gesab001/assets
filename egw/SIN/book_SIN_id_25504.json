    "word": "Moses requested all who had been free from this great sin of idolatry to come and stand by him at his right hand; also, those who had joined the rebellious in worshiping this idol, but who had repented of their sin in so quickly departing from God, to stand at his left hand. There was quite a large company, mostly of the mixed multitude, who instigated the making of the calf who were stubborn in their rebellion, and would not stand with Moses, either at his right hand or at his left. \n                                                                           284\nMoses then commanded those at his right hand to take their swords, and go forth and slay the rebellious, who wished to go back into Egypt. None were to execute the judgment of God on the transgressors only those who had taken no part in the idolatry. He commanded them to spare neither brother, companion, nor neighbor. Those who engaged in this work of slaying, however painful, were now to realize that they were executing upon their brethren a solemn punishment from God. And for executing this painful work, contrary to their own feelings, God would bestow upon them his blessing. By performing this act they showed their true feelings relative to the high crime of idolatry, and consecrated themselves more fully to the sacred worship of the only true God. The terror of the Lord was upon the people, and they were afraid that they would all be destroyed. As Moses saw their distress he promised according to their earnest request to plead with the Lord to pardon their great sin.",
