    "word": "My dear children, I love you because Christ loves you. You have been dearly purchased. All you are and all you have--time, talents, strength, thought, everything--has been redeemed by the blood of Christ to do Him highest service. The Lord can accept of nothing less than complete consecration, entire, willing obedience. Frank, my dear nephew, the power of the principles you profess has too often been neutralized by your practice. Your quickness of temper and bitterness of feeling keep you from good. The Lord can bless you only as you come to Him with humble heart, confessing your errors and sins.",
