    "word": "We visited Dr. Lewis. . . . We think him near insanity. He has a house in which he has put two hundred and thirty thousand dollars and he is yet making improvements. We stepped into apparently a little bedroom, four by six, sat upon a nice sofa, and were hoisted by an elevator up four stories to Dr. Lewis' room; and yet there were four stories above the doctor's rooms. We could look all over Boston. The doctor has been engaged in business so long that he has a diseased brain. He told us frankly all about his condition. I think this statement of his case helped father. It certainly explained things to me I had not before understood. I see that we must all be more careful of our words and actions when father is overwhelmed with care.--Letter 15, 1871. (To Edson and Emma White, November 15, 1871.)",
