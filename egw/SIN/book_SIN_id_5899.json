    "word": "\"Little Things\" Make Life a Success.--It is conscientious attention to what the world terms \"little things\" that makes life a success. Little deeds of charity, little acts of self-denial, speaking simple words of helpfulness, watching against little sins--this is Christianity. A grateful acknowledgment of daily blessings, a wise improvement of daily opportunities, a diligent cultivation of entrusted talents--this is what the Master calls for. --YI, Jan. 17, 1901.",
