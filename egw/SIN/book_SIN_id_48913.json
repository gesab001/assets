    "word": "I have been waiting to hear from you again regarding the place near Redlands, about which you wrote not long ago. I hope that this place can be secured, because I think that the Lord has made it possible for us to obtain it. If you have anything further to tell us, please do so. We do not want this place to be a snare to us; for I feel impressed that it will be a great blessing. I hope that you will send me a line when you have come to a decision regarding the place.",
