    "word": "Here were the cases of several who had backslidden; who had been in darkness; who had strayed away from the fold. But especially, as a prominent one, was the case of Bro. George Lay. He strayed from the fold. All the efforts were not made in wisdom, which should have been made to have prevented his straying from the fold, and then after he had strayed, there were not diligent efforts put forth to bring him back. There was much more gossiping over his case than sincere sorrow for him. All these things kept him from the fold, and caused his heart to be separated farther and farther from his brethren, making his rescue more and still more difficult.
