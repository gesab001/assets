    "word": "The soul who has never submitted to God will show that mercy and pity have no place in his disposition, for he will betray a spirit wholly unlike Jesus. He will be harsh, unrelenting, unforgiving. If something arises in the home life that does not suit him, he will magnify the annoyance, will be resentful, harsh, dictatorial to those whom he considers in fault. But such are not the children of God. They are the children of the wicked one. They dishonor Christ, bruise Him, and put Him to an open shame. Though they may take an active part in meeting and in missionary work, they are stumbling-blocks to sinners. Let these poor, dark, deceived souls examine themselves. Let them understand the love of God, and closely criticize themselves, considering what manner of spirit they are of. Let them come to the point where they will forgive everyone his trespasses.",
