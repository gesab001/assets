The Lord \u201cformed the earth and made it; He hath established it, He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited.\u201d Isaiah 45:18. That purpose will be fulfilled, when, renewed by the power of God, and freed from sin and sorrow, it shall become the eternal abode of the redeemed. \u201cThe righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.\u201d \u201cAnd there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him.\u201d Psalm 37:29; Revelation 22:3.\u2014PP 67.",
