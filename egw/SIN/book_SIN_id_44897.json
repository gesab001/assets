    "word": "May the Lord open the eyes of His people that they may see, and give them understanding that they may perceive. I cannot describe to you, [but] I have been shown God's displeasure at the robbery of a field of its own donated treasure. This money should never have been used to cancel debts. If the institutions in Battle Creek owed the Pacific Press, should the Pacific Press have laid hands on the money sacredly dedicated \n\n\n                                     -146- \n\nto the Lord, donated by His people to the Southern field? Is it thus that the work of God is to be mingled with the wood, hay, and stubble of man's inventions? Is it not time that in every one of the Lord's institutions faithful, trustworthy men be appointed by the people to examine every business transaction?--Letter 98, 1899. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nOctober 25, 1990. Entire Letter.",
