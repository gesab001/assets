As the agony of soul came upon Him, \"His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground\" (Luke 22:44). His  terrible anguish, caused by the thought that in this hour of need God had forsaken Him, portrays the anguish that the sinner will feel when, too late, he realizes that God's Spirit is withdrawn from him.--MS 134, 1905.",
