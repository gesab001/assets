    "word": "Smith Sharp: I stayed there and helped them to harvest, and he and I shocked oats together, and he did not intimate that he could not work with Brother Rogers. {PCO 145.10} \n     E. G. White: Well, I knew that there would be a difficulty with the colored ones, and I thought perhaps it would be thus with this our brother, but it would be for his good, for it is a sad thing to get an idea that they could not work with Brother Rogers, because it is a sin to feel that way. Now Brother Nicola, I feel sorry for Brother Nicola.\n146\nIt is because he has not had the blending of the mind and the education of the mind so that he can carry a controlling influence, and yet he assumes that he can do it all. He has not that controlling influence, like government, in his own children; he does not understand; and now then, how can he govern a school? That is the question. And I wish that these brethren could blend together, because I do not want Brother Rogers to take the responsibility so much that he cannot give some influence in a place, and some advice and counsel. I don\u2019t like it to be put in that phase. {PCO 145.11} \n     There is nothing under the sun in any of these enterprises-nothing under the sun like a heave-e-o-heave, and success to bring success.",
