    "word": "Now, I wish you to understand fully that God does not want, neither will he accept, an offering made grudgingly and murmuringly. [For] all that you have given with this spirit you will receive no reward, for not one cent of your money will God accept, only as you make it a freewill offering, feeling that it is a pleasure for you to be acting stewards of God, the Lord passing the means into your hands and you passing it out as His cause demands. If you have not means to pay your pledge, then don't grumble. The Lord does not require what you have not. Do the very best you can.",
