    "word": "Separate and Distinct Entities.--Again and again, at different times and in different places, decided warnings have been given me. I could not define the import of these warnings, for they were presented to me in figures and symbols. I have been very much puzzled over this matter, which was introduced before my husband's death. Since that time I have been shown that efforts would be made to bind up the publishing house in Oakland with the publishing house in Battle Creek, in order that the publishing house at Battle Creek might have control. These warnings I did not fully understand, because many times the message had been given me that these two institutions should not be at strife one with another, or manifest anything savoring of jealousy or envy, but that they should stand as sister institutions, each doing its appointed work as God's instrumentality. . . . Each institution was established of God to do its respective work.",
