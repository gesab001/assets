    "word": "I feel so grateful that we have this large farm on which to carry on our school work. I am so glad that it is productive land. But it cannot be expected to bring forth fruit if it is left uncultivated, From this we may learn a spiritual lesson. \u201cIt is My Father\u2019s good pleasure,\u201d Christ says to His disciples, \u201cthat ye bear much fruit.\u201d But you cannot bear much fruit unless you take out of your lives the weeds of selfishness and sin. We do not ask what your past life may have been. We ask you to take out of your hearts, now, the weeds of evil, and let the word of truth dwell in you richly, that your lives may produce the fruits of righteousness and holiness. If you will do this, you will see in the kingdom of God the result of what you have learned on this school farm. Pull up the weeds of evil in your hearts, and plant the seeds of truth.",
