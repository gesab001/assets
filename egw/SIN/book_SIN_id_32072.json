    "word": "U. T.--Aug. 30, '96 (H. L. para. 417) \n     At too many tables, when the stomach has received all that it requires to carry on the work of nourishing the system, another course, consisting of pies, puddings, and highly flavored sauces, is placed upon the table. . . . Many, though they have already eaten enough, will overstep the bounds, and eat the tempting dessert, which, however, proves anything but good to them. . . . If the extras which are provided for dessert were dispensed with altogether, it would be a blessing.",
