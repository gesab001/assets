    "word": "If an automobile were owned by the Sanitarium, it should be cared for and operated by men who are capable and trustworthy. Otherwise it might be unsafe, and might involve large expense to the institution. But if proper caution is observed, an automobile would be a blessing to the Paradise Valley Sanitarium, and if you feel impressed to present your machine to the institution, it would be greatly appreciated by the managers, and also by the patients.--Letter 118, 1909, p. 1. (To James Morrow, June 24, 1909.)",
