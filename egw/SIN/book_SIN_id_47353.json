    "word": "Has not God been speaking early and late for years, and you have not heard and obeyed His voice? With every one connected with the office the efficiency for good is derived from Christ Jesus; the saving power of grace is not guess work; it consists in an actual relation between sinful man and his heavenly Father, between the sinner and his divine advocate. Every man in connection with the work of God has his measure of responsibility. In himself he can do nothing, but God is the vital power, and the human agent must work, realizing his personal responsibility and using the oars God has placed in his hands.",
