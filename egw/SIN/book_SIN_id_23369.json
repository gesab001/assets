    "word": "By learning the lessons of obedience, children are not only honoring their parents and lightening their burdens, but they are pleasing One higher in authority. \"Honour thy father and thy mother\" is a positive command. Children who treat their parents with disrespect, and disregard their wishes, not only dishonor them, but break the law of God. The earlier the will is made to yield to the will of the parents, and the more complete the submission, the less difficult it will be to yield to the requirements of God. And none can hope for the love and blessing of God who do not learn obedience to His commandments, and stand up firmly against temptation.",
