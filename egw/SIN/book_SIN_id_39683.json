    "word": "We have only a half loaf of graham and one loaf of white, and half of one of the rusk bread. It is all moist and good. Someone helped himself to our oranges. We think our apples go well. We are well satisfied with our meals. Those around us are loaded with chicken, pickles, corned beef, jellies, and tea and coffee. None seem to feel as well as we do, who eat only twice a day of simple food. Not anything warm yet to eat or drink. We feel the blessing of the Lord attends us. Praise His dear name! We will love and serve Him. Be of good courage. Be cheerful. And don't one of you forget that in God must be your trust. Here we are at Sidney. God bless you.--Letter 11a, 1875. (To \"Dear Children,\" May 3, 1875.) \n\n\n                                     -132-",
