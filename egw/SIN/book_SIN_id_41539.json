    "word": "MR No. 773 - Warning Regarding Future Troubles\n\n     The Sabbath is the sign between God and His people. Please read the last seven verses of the thirty-first chapter of Exodus (verses 12-18). What could be more definite, more decided than this? As a people we are to keep ourselves separate from the world. We are to enter into no confederacy with those upon whom for years the light of truth has been shining, but who have not walked in the light. We are conscientiously to honor God, diligently using every means of keeping in covenant relation with Him, that we may receive His blessings--the blessings so essential for the people who are to be so severely tried.",
