    "word": "At one time in Battle Creek, the scenes of the judgment were presented before me. The books were opened, and all, both old and young who claimed to be keeping the commandments of God were gathered about the throne.

Great numbers were weighed in the balances and found wanting who knew for just what sins they were condemned. It was because of the lack of a virtuous character.",
