    "word": "Laws of Health to Be Strictly Obeyed.--A great amount of suffering might be saved if all would labor to prevent disease by strictly obeying the laws of health. Strict habits of cleanliness should be observed.\n174\nMany, while well, will not take the trouble to keep in a healthy condition. They neglect personal cleanliness, and are not careful to keep their clothing pure. Impurities are constantly and imperceptibly passing from the body, through the pores; and if the surface of the skin is not kept in a healthy condition, the system is burdened with impure matter.",
