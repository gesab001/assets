    "word": "The Lord has presented the matter before me in clear lines. The publishing interest should not have been removed from South Hampton to Grimsby; but should have remained in that important place, where greater character would have been given to the work until it could have been removed to London. That large city needs one hundred workers, and then the workers would scarcely be in touch one with another, if their fields were located in different parts. Our brethren in America must have the matter kept before them that men and means are needed for Europe, and for regions beyond. Our brethren in this country need the baptism of the Holy Spirit of God such as the disciples had on the day of Pentecost, in order that they may have an eye single to discern not only the things that are nigh, but fields that are afar off. When they see as God seeth, they will plan and devise, and work altogether more disinterestedly, and have a deep realization of the fact that the field for the gospel work is the world.",
