    "word": "Sister, work on in faith. Jesus loves you, and He would have you trustful, strong in His love, and you can be a blessing in many ways, at the right and left. Whatever you shall see inconsistent in practical godliness in those who claim to be children of God, be not discouraged at all. Stand, looking unto Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of your faith. The Holy One has given us rules for the guidance of all.",
