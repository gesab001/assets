    "word": "With the majesty of an omnipotent King, our Saviour unites the gentleness and tender care of a shepherd. His power is absolute. The heart of man only is able to withstand His working. He can be hindered by no obstacle save the perverse, sinful hearts of those who refuse to yield to His control. The hardness of the heart of man is the only obstacle that hinders the work of grace in the soul. By a determination to carry out his own ideas, irrespective of the warnings and entreaties of God, man separates himself from the blessing that God longs to bestow.",
