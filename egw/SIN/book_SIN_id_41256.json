    "word": "It has been my life study since I was eleven years of age, that I might place my feet in the road cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in. I do not expect this path will be smooth and without trouble, but my precious Jesus traveled that path before me and He has beat down the thorns and rough places and made a smooth path for my feet, and I will follow in His footsteps \n\n\n                                    -407- \n\nand choose the suffering part of religion. I want to be a partaker with Christ of His sufferings, and then I have the promise that I will be partaker with Him in His glory.--Ms 16, 1887, pp. 5, 7.
