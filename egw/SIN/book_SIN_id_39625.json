    "word": "When within four miles of home we were so unfortunate as to enter upon a road open for several miles but entirely blocked up and impassable at the other end. The horses went up to their backs in drifts. We feared their getting down. After passing through fields we were told there was no possibility of getting through and had to go back. As we passed over drifts we got out, lightened the sleigh and again plowed through the snow, while it was steadily raining. After this we had no very special difficulties.",
