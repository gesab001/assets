    "word": "There are some who need to give expression to their religion in a different way than they have done in the past. They need to be ashamed of their past course of action, their lack of consecration and love, and to be reconverted. Then they will take hold humbly of any part of the work that needs their help. They need to learn how to pray and work for souls. The truth for these last days is to be proclaimed by purified human lips. When the live coal from the altar shall touch the lips of the believers, and they have been refined and purified by the Holy Spirit of God, then God can entrust them with his solemn message, and use them to glorify his name. Then they can teach transgressors the way of the Lord, and sinners will be converted unto him. \n\n\n                                       (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
