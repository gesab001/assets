    "word": "There are those who, while professing to believe present truth have degraded their faith and refused to walk in the light. Who will now lay aside their selfish, worldly principles? Who will now strive to realize the worth of the soul? What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Are you hungering and thirsting for the bread of life and the water of salvation? Do you realize the value of the souls for whom Christ died? Are those who are supposed to be Christians living up to their profession of faith? Are they conscious of the worth of the soul? Are they striving to purify their souls through obedience to the truth?--Ms 129, 1905. \n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. May 11, 1989. Entire Ms.",
