    "word": "If Christ were on earth today, surrounded by those who bear the title of \"Reverend\" or \"Right Reverend,\" would He not repeat His saying, \"Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ\"? Matthew 23:10. The Scripture declares of God, \"Holy and reverend is his name.\" To what human being is such a title befitting? How little does man reveal of the wisdom and righteousness it indicates! How many of those who assume this title are misrepresenting the name and character of God! Alas, how often have worldly ambition, despotism, and the basest sins been hidden under the broidered garments of a high and holy office!",
