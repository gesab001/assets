    "word": "Oh, what matchless charm there is in Jesus! And to dwell with Him and stand around His throne, having all the stains of sin washed away in the blood of Christ, to dwell with Him forever and ever, is surely worth striving for. Angels will attend us here and help us to walk aright, and keep us from the evil. We need to love one another as Christ loved us, and be a blessing to all around us. Christ has told us that if we are followers of Him He will lead us to the fountains of living waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes. \"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat\" [Revelation 7:16].",
