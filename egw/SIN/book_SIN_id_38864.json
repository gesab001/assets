    "word": "A family of my acquaintance had three interesting daughters who were convicted of the truth and gave evidence of change of heart. These children were willing to put on the reform dress, but the parents, through pride, wished their children to dress as others dressed. They objected to their being singular from the world. They feared remarks would be made upon their children's dress. This family had great light. The Spirit of God worked in their behalf to save them from ruin. They had undoubted evidence that the testimonies were of God; and yet they trifled with the light given relative to the reform dress, because it crossed their pride. Their children were sent away from home to school, and mingled with young company, and engaged with the young generally in their parties of pleasure and amusement. They dressed as others of their companions dressed, and lost their interest in truth. I heard the parents with deep feeling express their regret that they did not encourage their daughters to put on the reform dress from principle. They said if they had done so they were now convinced their children would be with them in the truth. The \n                                                                           64\nreform dress would have kept them separate from the world. They would not have had so strong inclination to attend parties of pleasure and mingle with their worldly companions in exciting amusements, which diverted their minds from God and the truth.",
