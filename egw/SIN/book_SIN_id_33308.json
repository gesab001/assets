    "word": "Of the apostolic church, in those bright days when the glory of the risen Christ shone upon them, it is written that no man said \"that aught of the things which he possessed was his own.\" \"Neither was there any among them that lacked.\" \"And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.\" \"And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.\" Acts 4:32, 34, 33; 2:46, 47.",
