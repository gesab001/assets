    "word": "Chap. 13 - Duties and Dangers of the Youth\n\n(Addressed to Two Young Men)\n\n\n     These young men should remember that they are responsible for all the privileges they have enjoyed: that they are accountable for the improvement of their time, and must render an exact account for the improvement of their abilities. They may inquire. Shall we have no amusement or recreation? Shall we work, work, work, without variation? Any amusement in which they can engage asking the blessing of God upon it in faith, will not be dangerous; but any amusement which disqualifies them for secret prayer, for devotion at the altar of prayer, or for taking part in the prayer-meeting, is not safe, but dangerous.",
