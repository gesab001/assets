    "word": "Well, I must close. I cannot write letters to America this week as I would be pleased to do. There are constantly arising matters which demand attention. Letters have to be written, and visiting has to be done, and much talking in meeting, much traveling, packing and unpacking beds and bedding, and I cannot tax my powers more than I have done. I must not get my mind in a worry, but keep it calm and peaceful. The Lord is helping and blessing me. I think of you and your family often, and do so hope every precious soul . . . will be united with the family who shall be prepared to see Jesus when He shall come.--Letter 75, 1893. (Written on Nov. 30, 1893, at Wellington, New Zealand.)",
