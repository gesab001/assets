    "word": "The call is to go forth, \"Son, go labor today in My vineyard.\" As this call is obeyed, the message that means so much to the dwellers on the earth, will be heard and understood.

The truth will bear away the victory.--Letter 230, July 5, 1906, to the elders of the Battle Creek church and to ministers and physicians.",
