    "word": "The Holy Spirit is your hope. As you lift the cross of Calvary, it lifts you. Bearing the cross after Jesus, following in His consecrated, self-denying footsteps--only thus can you find salvation. The Word of the living God is your guide and counsellor. Jesus Christ is the way into the holy of holies-- the way without a screen. The sinner is humbled; the Saviour is exalted as all and in all. This is your refuge.--Letter 124, 1901, pp. 1, 2. (To Brother and Sister Sanderson, circa Sept. 12, 1901.)",
