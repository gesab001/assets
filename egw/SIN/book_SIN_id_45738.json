    "word": "Light Reading \n     I ask you to put away from your homes all light reading. Do not fill the house with magazines, so that when one comes in the first thing he picks up is a magazine. The Lord has nothing to do with such reading. It fills the mind with trash. Those who indulge in it are bringing to the foundation wood, hay, and stubble. It is a sin in the sight of God to give the mind to such reading, for He claims our thoughts. We are to serve Him with the mind. In the Bible you will find reading that will be food to the soul. We \n\n\n                                    -353- \n\nhave no time to spend in light reading. Let us study what saith the Word of God. Let us find out from the Scriptures what are the conditions of salvation.",
