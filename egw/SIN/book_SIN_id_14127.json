    "word": "The Lord designs that the light He has given on the Scriptures shall shine forth in clear, bright rays, and it is the duty of our canvassers to put forth a strong, united effort that God's designs may be accomplished. A great and important work is before us. The enemy of souls realizes this, and he is using every means in his \n71\npower to lead the canvassers to take up some other line of work. This order of things should be changed. God calls the canvassers back to their work. He calls for volunteers who will put all their energies and enlightenment into the work, helping wherever there is opportunity. The Master calls for every one to do the part given him, according to his ability. Who will respond to the call? Who will go forth to labor in the wisdom and grace and love of Christ for those nigh and afar off? Who will sacrifice ease and pleasure and enter the places of error, superstition, and darkness, working earnestly and perseveringly, speaking the truth in simplicity, praying in faith, and doing house-to-house labor? Who at this time will go forth without the camp, imbued with the power of the Holy Spirit, bearing reproach for Christ's sake, opening the Scriptures to the people, and calling them to repentance?",
