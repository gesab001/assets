    "word": "Your work is, in Christ's stead, to beseech men to be reconciled to God. You stand as His messenger, as a steward of the mysteries of God; and \n\n\n                                   -311- \n\nwhen your spirit does not reveal a calm, holy trust in God, stop just where you are, lest you speak unadvisedly. Never in a single instance let your impetuous spirit triumph. Wherever you may go, in any place, in any country, self must die daily, and Christ must live and be revealed in you, else you dishonor God and the truth. Wherever you may go you are under God's jurisdiction; in all places and under all circumstances your liberty is to be exercised in strict accordance to the law of God.",
