    "word": "Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied servant of man's necessity. He \"took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses,\" that He might minister to every need of humanity. The burden of disease and wretchedness and sin He came to remove. It was His mission to bring to men complete restoration; He came to give them health and peace and perfection of character.",
