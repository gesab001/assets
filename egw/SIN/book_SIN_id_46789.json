Should he turn his back on all the principles of missionary work, and handle the book -- placed before him, shall I say, as a temptation? -- on which he can make the most money? Shall he have no interest to circulate any book but that which brings him the greatest financial gain? How is the missionary spirit revealed here? Has not the canvassing work ceased to be what it ought to be? How is it that no voice is raised to correct this state of things?",
