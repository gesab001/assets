    "word": "The words falling from the lips of Jesus, \u201cThy sins be forgiven thee\u201d (Matthew 9:2), are worth everything to us. He saith, I have borne your sins in My own body on Calvary\u2019s cross. He sees your sorrows. His hand is laid upon the head of every contrite soul, and Jesus becomes our Advocate before the Father, and our Saviour. The lowly, contrite heart will make very much of forgiveness and pardon. . . .",
