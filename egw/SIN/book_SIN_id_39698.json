    "word": "(Colorado,) Tuesday, July 1, 1873. It is stormy. We see from the window it is snowing. . . . The hills are covered with snow. We are thankful to have a good fire to keep us warm. We cleaned house again. I find it new business to scrub, but I enjoy it. It cleared off beautifully about noon. The clouds lifted from the snowy range and we had a most beautiful view of the mountains, not merely capped with snow but covered completely with snow.",
