    "word": "Let us seek God together. I want His Spirit. I long after Him. \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after . . . the living God\" (Psalms 42:1, 2). I want, brethren and sisters, that we should come right to the cross and seek Christ and His love, mercy, and compassion, and see how He values the human soul. You can never measure it, except as you come to the cross. And, because not every soul is cast upon the same mold as yours, that is no reason that they are not worth anything. God has a work for every one of them; and we want to work for souls, to labor for them as those who must give an account, that in the judgment they shall not come to us and say, \"You did not show any of the mercy and love and tenderness of Christ to me. If you had, it would have broken my heart.\" We want our hearts to be broken--they are altogether too hard. Let them break, and let Christ put His mold and His superscription upon the soul. Then what shall we see? We shall see the mighty revealings of the Spirit of God as on the day of Pentecost. Then we shall be able to move others, to move the youth in the school. But in whatever branch of the work you are engaged, you can go singing all the way to Zion. Not that you will not have any characters around you hard to deal with--you will have them--but you can deal with them so much more easily because Christ is your Helper, because Christ is with you, and you are laborers together with God.--Manuscript 8a, 1891, pp. 1-10. (\"The Proper Way to Deal With Students in Our Schools,\" July 21, 1891.) \n\n\n                                  -65-",
