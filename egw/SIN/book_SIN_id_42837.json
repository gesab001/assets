    "word": "The weather is very mild in this part of California. We had soft, gentle showers every day for two weeks. For three days I have had no fire \n\n\n                                   -259- \n\nin my large office room. I do not have a stove in my room, but an open fireplace which is perfect in its construction. I am generally up hours before any other member of my family. On rising I build my fire, take a bath in cold water before the fire, and then, after my praying season, take my pen in hand and, from two o'clock until seven, write many pages. We have family prayers just before breakfast, which is at half past seven. I generally retire at seven o'clock in the evening.",
