    "word": "Light has been given me that there are papers that have been drawn up by lawyers that are blinding the eyes of the simple people of God. Men have means that they are willing to lend at interest, and these papers, signed by those to whom the money is lent, are given as security. But if those receiving the money should change leaders, if they should turn away from straightforward principles, they could, because of the wording of the papers, take advantage of those whose money they have received, and bring in oppression. We are to guard against the things that tempt men to hurt their fellow-men. We are to guard against the acceptance of documents framed in language that is confusing to minds. We have no need of such documents. They are a snare, and our people are warned to beware of them.",
