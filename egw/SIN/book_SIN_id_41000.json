    "word": "We need not tax our minds for some far-fetched explanation of the words of Scripture. Thus the Jewish teachers did. They quoted the ideas and traditions of the rabbis, confusing the minds of their hearers. They taught for doctrine the commandments of men. We are not to seek for revelations that have not been made in the Word of God. In the simplicity of Christ we are to present the plain teaching of the Bible. Men in high positions of trust in the world will be charmed by a plain, straightforward, scriptural statement of truth.--Letter 111, 1904, pp. 3, 4. (To Brother Butler, March 13, 1904.) \n\nReleased January 18, 1977.",
