    "word": "We have got to mingle together. We are not to say, I am fully capable to handle this without any help, and work up the last jot and tittle of strength we have, and then we die. Now God is not pleased with that. He wants others to come and stand right by their side, and not to feel that somebody else will get the glory. God will not work with us until every speck of this business of trying to be first, and to get the glory, every bit of it has to go out of us, because we have to come to the kingdom of heaven without a spot or wrinkle or any such thing.",
