    "word": "The Lord Jesus connected Judas and Peter with himself, not because they were defective in character, but notwithstanding their defects. He would give them an opportunity to learn in his school, meekness and lowliness of heart, that they might become co-laborers with him. And if they would \n233\nimprove these opportunities, if they would be willing to learn, willing to see their deficiencies, and in the light of a pure example to become all that Christ would have them to be, then they would be a great blessing to the church. Thus the Lord Jesus is still dealing with men. Some who are still imperfect in character, are connected with solemn, sacred interests; and when chosen for a special work, they should not feel that their own wisdom is sufficient, that they need not be counseled, reproved, and instructed. Brethren, if you feel thus, you will separate from the Source of your strength, and will be in peril; you may be left to your own supposed sufficiency to do as Judas did,\u2014betray your Lord.",
