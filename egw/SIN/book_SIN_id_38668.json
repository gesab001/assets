    "word": "My brethren, you should see and feel your responsibility, and in view of it, humble your souls before God, and plead with him for wisdom. You have not realized how much the salvation of the souls of those whose bodies you are seeking to relieve from suffering, depends upon your words, your actions, and deportment. You are doing work which must bear the test of the Judgment. You must guard your own soul from the sins of selfishness, self-sufficiency, and self-confidence.",
