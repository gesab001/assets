    "word": "From Sinai the Lord spoke His law, making a wonderful display of His glory. There He made a covenant with all who promised to be obedient to His law. Obedience to the Sabbath was to be a sign between Him and His people, \"that ye may know,\" He said, \"that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. . . . Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever\" [Exodus 31:13, 16, 17].",
