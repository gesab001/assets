    "word": "In Germany the doctrine had been taught in the eighteenth century by Bengel, a minister in the Lutheran Church, and a celebrated Biblical scholar and critic. Upon completing his education, Bengel had devoted himself to the study of theology, \u201cto which the grave and religious tone of his mind, deepened and strengthened by his early training and discipline, naturally inclined him. Like other young men of thoughtful character, before and since, he had to struggle with doubts and difficulties of a religious nature, and he alludes, with much feeling, to the \u2018many arrows which pierced his poor heart, and made his youth hard to bear.\u2019\u201d Becoming a member of the consistory of Wurtemberg, he advocated the cause of religious liberty, urging \u201cthat all reasonable freedom be accorded those who felt themselves bound, on grounds of conscience, to withdraw from the established church.\u201d The good effects of this policy are still felt in his native province.",
