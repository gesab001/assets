    "word": "In the first of these tunnels, the Pfaffensprung, the train enters the side of a mountain, describes a complete ascending circle of over sixteen hundred yards, and, emerging from the mountain, crosses its own track one hundred and fifteen feet above the place where it entered. Then, crossing the boiling Reuss by a huge iron bridge, the train enters the Wattinger loop tunnel, in which an ascent of seventy-six feet is made. Then another bridge across the river, the considerable village of Wasen, and we plunge into the third curved tunnel. Beyond this the train skirts the mountain side, from which is obtained a grand view of the windings just traversed, lying far below. Altogether, this railroad has over fifty bridges, most of them large iron structures, and fifty-six tunnels.",
