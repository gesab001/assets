    "word": "Well, Brother Baker carried out this instruction to the letter. The cautions given were heeded. The light given was, When the seed of truth has been sown in the hearts of the people by the laborers at the camp meeting, then those who remain to follow up the work will, through the Spirit's power, be prepared to ripen off the work and gather in the harvest. The means used before the camp meeting would not be one-third as successful as the same expense and labor put forth after the influence of the meeting had been felt. In many cases such large advertising and distribution of publications hedges up the way instead of preparing it. Now we see a large, deep interest, and if the working forces will walk softly before God, if they will walk humbly, and pray, and watch unto prayer, they will have the cooperation of heavenly angels. Christ will work by His Holy Spirit upon human hearts.",
