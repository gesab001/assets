    "word": "Sister Sanderson, I am pleading with God for your soul's salvation. I feel an intense desire to see you free and happy in Christ Jesus, your heart full of the grace of God. I cannot endure the thought that you shall remain where you are. I cannot let you go. I long for your soul in Jesus Christ. I want to see you obtaining victory after victory. I have been conversing with you in the visions of the night. I saw your countenance changed by the reflection of the Spirit of God, and I was made joyful in the Lord.",
