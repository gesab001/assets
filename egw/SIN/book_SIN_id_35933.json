    "word": "I have the tenderest feelings toward Dr. Kellogg. For many years I have tried to hold fast to him. God's word to me has always been, \"You can help him.\" Sometimes I am awakened in the night, and, rising, I walk the room, praying: \"O Lord, hold Dr. Kellogg fast. Do not let him go. Keep him steadfast. Anoint his eyes with the heavenly eyesalve, that he may see all things clearly.\" Night after night I have lain awake, studying how I could help him. Earnestly and often I have prayed that the Lord may not permit him to turn away from sanctifying truth. This is the burden that weighs me down,-- the desire that he shall be kept from making mistakes that would hurt his soul and injure the cause of present truth. But for some time his actions have revealed that a strange spirit is controlling him. The Lord will take this matter in His own hands. I must bear the messages of warning that God gives me to bear, and then leave with the Lord the results. I \n                                                                           59\nmust now present the matter in all its bearings; for the people of God must not be despoiled.",
