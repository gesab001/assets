    "word": "Governor Washburn, of Wisconsin, in his annual message declared \u201cthat church fairs, charitable raffles, concert lotteries for charitable and other purposes, prize packages, \u2018grabbags,\u2019 Sabbath-school and other religious chances by ticket, are nurseries of crime, inasmuch as they promise something for nothing, are games of chance, and are really gambling. He says that the pernicious spirit of gambling is fostered, encouraged, and kept alive by these agencies to a degree little known by good citizens; and that, but for them, the ordinary laws against gambling would be much less violated and much more easily enforced. These practices, he declares, ought not to be permitted any longer to debauch the morals of the young.\u201d",
