    "word": "The plague of sin is upon Elder Waggoner, and pain and sorrow are upon the souls of all who are aware of this chapter in his experience. Christ is dishonored. A man blessed with superior light and knowledge, endowed with great capacity for good, that he may by a life of obedience and fidelity to God become equal with angels, [and] his life measure with the life of God, has perverted his God-given power to administer to lust, coveting the wife of another. God finds Elder Waggoner setting at naught the most costly lessons of experience, violating the most solemn admonitions of God, that he may continue in sin.",
