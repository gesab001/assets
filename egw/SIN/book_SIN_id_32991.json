    "word": "The test of sincerity is not in words, but in deeds. Christ does not say to any man, \"What say ye more than others?\" but, \"What do ye more than others?\" Full of deep meaning are His words, \"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them\" (John 13:17). Words are of no value unless they are spoken in sincerity and in truth. The talent of words is made effective and of value when they are accompanied by appropriate deeds. It is of vital consequence to every soul to hear the Word and be a doer of it.",
