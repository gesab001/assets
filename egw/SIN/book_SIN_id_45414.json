White handwritten addition at conclusion of typewritten letter. (To W. C. White, February 6, 1894.)-- Since writing the enclosed, Elder Starr has had a long talk with Fannie. Now she is just beginning to see the perverse spirit she has had, and how much I have had to bear with her ever since she has been in Melbourne. She now says it is all right if she is separated from the work, that she has brought it upon herself, and if the decision is that she goes to America, that she will submit and do anything they may counsel her to do.",
