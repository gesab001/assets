    "word": "Why Christ Came--When the human family received the deadly wound caused by Adam's transgression, it became needful for the sinless Son of God, One equal with the Father, to take our nature upon Him, and come to the world to live in our behalf a perfect life, making it possible for man, through His ministration, to become a partaker of the divine nature, and thus escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. It was as our Redeemer that He came, that those who believe in Him may receive from Him the strength and the virtue that will enable them to overcome in the struggle with evil. For this reason the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. As in Adam all die, even so, through accepting Christ as a personal Saviour, all may be alive. \"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him\" (John 3:36).",
