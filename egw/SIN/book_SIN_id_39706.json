    "word": "Let two or three students meet together, and ask God to help them to be missionaries in this school, a blessing and a help to their fellow-students . . . . When you rise in the morning, kneel at your bedside and ask God to give you strength to fulfill the duties of the day and to meet its temptations. Ask Him to help you to bring into your work Christ's sweetness of character. Ask Him to help you to speak words that will draw those around you nearer to Christ.--Ms 125, 1902, pp. 6, 7. (\"Words to Students,\" Oct. 1, 1902.)",
