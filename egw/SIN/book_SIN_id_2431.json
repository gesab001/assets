    "word": "Great Care in Choosing Men--Great care should be exercised in choosing men to occupy positions of responsibility as guardians of the churches.  My brethren, do not make this choice blindly, lest the flock of God be given an example that will teach them to tear and devour.  The men who bear responsibilities in the cause of Christ should be men of prayer and humility.  They are to act like men who in all their dealings with their brethren are guided by the Spirit of God.  They are to give an example of righteousness.  They are sacredly to guard the reputation of those who are doing the work of God.--Review and Herald, November 14, 1907.",
