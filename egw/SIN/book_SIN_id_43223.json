    "word": "I warn all to whom this letter may come that unless you follow where Christ leads the way, you will fall into Satan's snares and lose heaven. Your houses, your lands, are talents for which you are just as responsible to God as for any He has entrusted to you. You may bury your talent as did the slothful servant, but your business is to inquire of God and to watch for opportunities for doing good with your Lord's entrusted money. His cause is to be advanced. Souls are to be saved, and the question should not be, How much will this effort cost? Will it pay to venture? It will pay if one soul is rescued. That soul is estimated as of more value with God than a world.",
