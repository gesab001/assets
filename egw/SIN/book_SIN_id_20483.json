    "word": "When Legal Advice Is Important \n\n     At the camp meeting in Vermont, in 1870, I felt urged by the Spirit of God to bear a plain testimony relative to the duty of aged and wealthy parents in the disposition of their property.  I had been shown that some men who are shrewd, prudent, and sharp in regard to the transaction of business generally, men who are distinguished for promptness and thoroughness, manifest a want of foresight and promptness in regard to a proper disposal of their property while they are living. They know not how soon their probation may close; yet they pass on from year to year with their business unsettled, and frequently their lives finally close without their having the use of their reason.  Or they may die suddenly, without a moment's warning, and their property be disposed of in a manner that they would not have approved.  These are guilty of negligence; they are unfaithful stewards.",
