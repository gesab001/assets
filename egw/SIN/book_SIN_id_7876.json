    "word": "A Truth Hard to Grasp \n\n     Beholding the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world, he finds the peace of Christ; for pardon is written against his name, and he accepts the Word of God, \"Ye are complete in Him\" (Colossians 2:10). How hard is it for humanity, long accustomed to cherish doubt, to grasp this great truth! But what peace it brings to the soul, what vital life! In looking to ourselves for righteousness, by which to find acceptance with God, we look to the wrong place, \"for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23). We are to look to Jesus; for \"we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory\" (2 Corinthians 3:18). You are to find your completeness by beholding the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.",
