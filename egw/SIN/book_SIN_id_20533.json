    "word": "An evil influence has a perpetuating power.  I wish I could set this matter before God's commandment-keeping people just as it has been shown me.  Let the sad memory of Solomon's apostasy warn every soul to shun the same precipice.  His weakness and sin are handed down from generation to generation.  The greatest king that ever wielded a scepter, of whom it had been said that he was the beloved of God, through misplaced affection became contaminated and was miserably forsaken of his God.  The mightiest ruler of the earth had failed to rule his own passions.  Solomon may have been saved \"as by fire,\" yet his repentance could not efface those high places, nor demolish those stones, which remained as evidences of his crimes.  He dishonored God, choosing rather to be controlled by lust than to be a partaker of the divine nature.",
