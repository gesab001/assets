    "word": "The Lord has a right to claim from all His disciples that He shall be trusted. Let not the thought be entertained whether such erring ones can be Christ's. He will be our all-sufficient Helper, so that we shall not remain erring, but be enabled to attain to the holiness to which we are called through a close and intimate communion with Christ. If we fall short it will be through unbelief, and that is sin. With God there is no shortcoming in fulfilling His word.",
