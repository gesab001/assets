    "word": "The hot summer sun, that strengthens and ripens the hardy grain, destroys that which has no depth of root. So he who \u201chath not root in himself,\u201d\u201cdureth for a while\u201d; but \u201cwhen tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.\u201d Many receive the gospel \n21\nas a way of escape from suffering, rather than as a deliverance from sin. They rejoice for a season, for they think that religion will free them from difficulty and trial. While life moves smoothly with them, they may appear to be consistent Christians. But they faint beneath the fiery test of temptation. They cannot bear reproach for Christ\u2019s sake. When the word of God points out some cherished sin, or requires self-denial or sacrifice, they are offended. It would cost them too much effort to make a radical change in their life. They look at the present inconvenience and trial, and forget the eternal realities.  Ibid., pp. 46-48.41 {CSA 20.10} \nLove must be the principle of action. Love is the underlying principle of God\u2019s government in heaven and earth, and it must be the foundation of the Christian\u2019s character. This alone can make and keep him steadfast. This alone can enable him to withstand trial and temptation.",
