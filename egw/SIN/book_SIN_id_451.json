    "word": "Counsel to a Newly Married Couple.--Marriage, a union for life, is a symbol of the union between Christ and His church. The spirit that Christ manifests toward His church is the spirit that the husband and wife are to manifest toward each other.

In their mutual self-denial and self-sacrifice they will be a blessing to each other. . . .",
