    "word": "\"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word\" (verse 20). Now, that prayer of Christ's is for us that we may be sanctified through the truth. \"That they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me\" (verse 21). Get out the coldness from your heart; get out the evil surmisings; get out every bad thought; and let the Lord Jesus take the throne of the heart and reign there.",
