    "word": "Before the days of Huss, there were men in Bohemia who rose up to condemn openly the corruption in the church and the profligacy of the people. Their labors excited widespread interest. The fears of the hierarchy were roused, and persecution was opened against the disciples of the gospel. Driven to worship in the forests and the mountains, they were hunted by soldiers, and many were put to death. After a time it was decreed that all who departed from the Romish \n98\nworship should be burned. But while the Christians yielded up their lives, they looked forward to the triumph of their cause. One of those who taught that \u201csalvation was only to be found by faith in the crucified Saviour,\u201d declared when dying, \u201cThe rage of the enemies of truth now prevails against us, but it will not be forever; there shall arise one from among the common people, without sword or authority, and against him they shall not be able to prevail.\u201d Luther's time was yet far distant; but already one was rising, whose testimony against Rome would stir the nations.",
