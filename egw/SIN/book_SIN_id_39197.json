    "word": "But there are many who are practicing physicians who do not work with an eye single to the glory of God, but for the sake of gain to themselves. They exact exorbitant prices from those who require their services. They feel that they are not amenable to any one, and are not to be advised or counseled, but will follow their own impulses. In a large degree they work from selfish motives. In their medical practice they are not missionaries. Their unreasonable charges are recorded in the books by the true Witness, who says, \"I know thy works.\" The money physicians generally take from rich and poor, is in many cases too large for the services rendered and is reckoned no more or less than dishonest gain, by the God of Heaven; yet they demand these exorbitant prices for their professional aid, simply because they can do it; for when suffering, people must have help. The principles of truth are not brought into the soul to have a sanctifying influence upon their life and character, unless men are doers of the words of Christ.",
