    "word": "Please read the whole of this chapter with the fiftieth. When you are disappointed because of the spiritual lack you see in the churches and in individuals, read these promising words of inspiration. They are given for the encouragement of our churches, and are to be claimed in times of emergency. When you meet with those who are not willing to be helped and strengthened, do not allow yourself to become discouraged. When you find halting and disaffection among the believers, let your faith be strong in God, whom in the past you have proved to be true.",
