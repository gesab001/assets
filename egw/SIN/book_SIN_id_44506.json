    "word": "Your family need to exercise great caution in bringing matters of a disagreeable nature to your attention. They should not tell you of grievances or complaints against anyone; for when your brain is tired and worn, anything like another's wrongdoing awakens a train of thought that is most painful and distressing, and you concentrate your mind on these small things till they grow to gigantic proportions, and then you are liable to say something that will wound yourself and others. Thus you mar the work of God and lessen your influence. Your brethren do not understand your peculiar temperament, and therefore they do not know what your words mean, nor how to handle your case.",
