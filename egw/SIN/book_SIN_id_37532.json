    "word": "The serpent lifted up in the wilderness represented the Son of man lifted upon the cross. Christ said to Nicodemus, \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\" In the wilderness all who looked upon the elevated brazen serpent lived, while those who \n                                                                           80\nrefused to look died. The two thieves upon the cross represent the two great classes of mankind. All have felt the poison of sin, represented by the sting of the fiery serpent in the wilderness. Those who look upon and believe in Jesus Christ, as the thief looked upon him when lifted upon the cross, shall live forever; but those who refuse to look upon him and believe in him, as the hardened thief refused to look upon and believe in the crucified Redeemer, shall die without hope.",
