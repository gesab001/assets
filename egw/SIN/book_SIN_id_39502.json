    "word": "The student should not think that because he is asked to conduct a class in reading or spelling, or some other study, he is being deprived of any of the time he desires for instruction. He should not feel that he is losing  time, because he is not. In imparting to others what he has received, he is preparing his mind to receive more. He may remember, as he strives to do his best, that the angels sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation, understand the situation and will lead his mind, quickening his understanding and bringing to him thoughts that shed light on the subject under consideration, making it plain and clear.",
