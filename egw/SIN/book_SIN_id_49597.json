    "word": "My brethren, you are not to thrust blindly in the dark; for you know not which will prosper, this or that. Restrain the tendency to judge motives. You do not know or understand in regard to the presentation that has been given me. I can not help being intensely interested in every movement made in the Southern field. I know much about that work; for I have kept pace with it and with the planning and devising of the workers, I have known of the struggles and makeshifts, the self-denial and self-sacrifice, that have been bravely borne. I have helped the workers as much as I could, sharing their work and encouraging them by sending them gifts of money and of books. And I know something in regard to what these books have already done and will continue to do.",
