    "word": "I am instructed to warn our people that the perils of the last days are upon us. Those whose minds have become confused over the beautiful theories presented in Living Temple are losing their confidence in the faith once delivered to the saints. There are those who cannot discern their own danger. They have placed themselves where they reject the warnings of God's Spirit, and the enemy is working through them to draw souls away from Christ. I am bidden to say, Beware, beware.",
