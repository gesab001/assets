    "word": "Charcoal and Flaxseed.--We need a hospital so much. On Thursday Sister Sara McEnterfer [A TRAINED NURSE OF EXPERIENCE WELL QUALIFIED FOR THIS TYPE OF SERVICE WHO ACCOMPANIED MRS. WHITE AND ASSISTED HER BOTH AS A TRAVELING COMPANION AND PRIVATE SECRETARY.--COMPILERS.] was called to see if she could do anything for Brother B's little son, who is \n                                                                           300\neighteen months old. For several days he has had a painful swelling on the knee, supposed to be from the bite of some poisonous insect. Pulverized charcoal, mixed with flaxseed, was placed upon the swelling, and this poultice gave relief at once. The child had screamed with pain all night, but when this was applied, he slept. Today she has been to see the little one twice. She opened the swelling in two places, and a large amount of yellow matter and blood was discharged freely. The child was relieved of its great suffering. We thank the Lord that we may become intelligent in using the simple things within our reach to alleviate pain, and successfully remove its cause.--Manuscript 68, 1899 (General Manuscript).",
