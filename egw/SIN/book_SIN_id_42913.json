    "word": "None of us need flatter ourselves that while the world is progressing in wickedness we shall have no difficulties. It is these very difficulties that bring us to the audience chamber of the Most High, to seek counsel of One who is infinite in wisdom. He loves to have us seek Him, to trust Him, and believe in Him. If we had no perplexities, no trials, we would become self-sufficient and lifted up in ourselves. The true saints will be purified and made white and tried.",
