    "word": "The Best Way to Reach Souls.--In the very shadows of the houses of God there are multitudes of godless sinners, without a knowledge of the truth, without hope. . . . In every city, in every settlement where Christians meet to worship God, there are men and women and children to be gathered into the fold. Many never hear a discourse on God's Word. Who will take upon himself a burden for souls? Who will learn from the Great Teacher that the best way to reach souls is by direct, personal appeal to erring individuals, to those who are dead in trespasses and sins, to behold their uplifted, crucified Redeemer, and live? Christians, let your hearts be filled with sympathy and love for those who know not the truth.--Manuscript 81, 1900.",
