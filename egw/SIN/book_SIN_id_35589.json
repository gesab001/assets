    "word": "Love and Confidence Among Brethren. \n\n     When men will show confidence in their fellow-men, they will come much nearer to possessing the mind of Christ. The Lord has revealed the estimate that he places upon man. \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" But some minds are ever seeking to re-shape the character of others according to their own ideas and measure. God has not given them this work to do.",
