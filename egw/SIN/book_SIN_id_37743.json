    "word": "Jesus re-instated Peter in his former position of trust. He gave him the commission, \"Feed my lambs,\" and the twice-repeated injunction, \"Feed my sheep.\" The naturally impetuous and overbearing Peter, who once repulsed the mothers that came to Christ bringing their little children to receive his blessing, now that he was converted, was prepared to nurse the lambs of the Master's fold, as well as to care for the more experienced sheep. Here we see the defeat of Peter turned into a victory.",
