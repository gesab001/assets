    "word": "If professed Christians love Jesus better than the world, they will love to speak of Him, their best Friend, in whom their highest affections are centered. He came to their aid when they felt their lost and perishing condition. When weary and heavy-laden with sin, they turned unto Him. He removed their burden of guilt and sin, . . . and turned the whole current of their affections. The things they once loved, they now hate; and the things they hated, they now love.",
