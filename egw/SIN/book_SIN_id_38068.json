    "word": "SCHOOLS OF THE EARLY CHURCH.--\"EDUCATION AMONG THE EARLY CHRISTIANS HAS BEEN BEAUTIFULLY PORTRAYED BY COLEMAN. \"THE TENDER SOLICITUDE OF THESE EARLY CHRISTIANS FOR THE RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THEIR CHILDREN,\" HE SAYS, \"IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHARACTERISTICS. THEY TAUGHT THEM EVEN AT THE EARLIEST DAWN OF INTELLIGENCE THE SACRED NAMES OF GOD AND THE SAVIOUR. THEY SOUGHT TO LEAD THE INFANT MINDS OF THEIR CHILDREN UP TO GOD BY FAMILIAR NARRATIVES FROM SCRIPTURE, \n\n\n                       -36- \n\nOF JOSEPH, OF YOUNG SAMUEL, OF JOSIAH, AND OF THE HOLY CHILD JESUS. THE HISTORY OF THE PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS, APOSTLES, AND HOLY MEN, WHOSE LIVES ARE NARRATED IN THE SACRED VOLUME, WERE THE NURSERY TALES WITH WHICH THEY SOUGHT TO FORM THE TENDER MINDS OF THEIR CHILDREN. AS THE MIND OF THE CHILD EXPANDED, THE PARENTS MADE IT THEIR SACRED DUTY AND DELIGHTFUL TASK DAILY TO EXERCISE HIM IN THE RECITAL OF SELECT PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE RELATING TO THE DOCTRINES AND DUTIES OF RELIGION. THE BIBLE WAS THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE FIRESIDE. IT WAS THE FIRST, THE LAST, THE ONLY SCHOOL BOOK ALMOST, OF THE CHILD; THE SACRED PSALMODY, THE ONLY SONG WITH WHICH HIS INFANT CRY WAS HUSHED AS HE WAS LULLED TO REST ON HIS MOTHER'S ARM. THE SACRED SONG AND THE RUDE MELODY OF ITS MUSIC WERE, FROM THE EARLIEST PERIODS OF CHRISTIAN ANTIQUITY, AN IMPORTANT MEANS OF IMPRESSING THE INFANT HEART WITH SENTIMENTS OF PIETY, AND OF IMBUING THE SUSCEPTIBLE MINDS OF THE YOUNG WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND FAITH OF THE SCRIPTURES.\"",
