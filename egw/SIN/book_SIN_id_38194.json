    "word": "Solemn Admonition. \n\n     It is a fearful thing for any soul to place himself on Satan's side of the question; for as soon as he does this, a change passes over him, as it is said of the king of Babylon, that his visage changed toward the three faithful Hebrews. Past history will be repeated. Men will reject the Holy Spirit's working, and open the door of the mind to Satanic attributes that separate them from God. They will turn against the very messengers through whom God sends the messages of warning. Even now I fear that the very things I am seeking to make plain will be misapplied, misinterpreted, and falsified; some have felt it a virtue to educate themselves in this line, and by their misapplication they make of no effect the messages God sends.",
