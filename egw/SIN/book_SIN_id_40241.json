    "word": "We returned December 12. On the evening of the next day, Brother Faulkhead called to see me. The burden of his case was upon my mind. I told him that I had a message for him and his wife, which I had several times prepared to send them, but I had felt forbidden by the Spirit of the Lord to do so. I asked him to appoint a time when I could see them. He answered, \"I am glad that you did not send me a written communication; I would rather have the message from your lips; had it come in another way I do not think it would have done me any good.\" He then asked, \"Why not give me the message now?\" I said, \"Can you remain to hear it?\" He replied that he would do so. I was very weary, for I had attended the closing exercises of the school that day; but I now arose from the bed where I was lying and read to him for three hours. His heart was softened, tears were in his eyes, and when I ceased reading, he said, \"I accept every word; all of it belongs to me.\" Much of the matter I had read related to the Echo office and its management from the beginning. The Lord also revealed to me Brother Faulkhead's connection with the Free Masons, and I plainly stated that unless he severed every tie that bound him to these associations he would lose his soul. \n\n\n                                   -149-",
