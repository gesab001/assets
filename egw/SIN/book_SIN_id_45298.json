    "word": "Avoid Self-Confidence \n     You are constantly inclined to individual independence. You do not realize that independence is a poor thing when it leads you to have too much confidence in yourself, and to trust to your own judgment rather than to respect the counsel and highly estimate the judgment of your brethren, especially of those in the offices which God has appointed for the saving of His people. God has invested His church with special authority and power which no one can be justified in disregarding and despising; for in so doing he despises the voice of God.--Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 417.",
