    "word": "In the Garden of Gethsemane Christ suffered in man's stead, and the human nature of the Son of God staggered under the terrible horror of the guilt of sin, until from His pale and quivering lips was forced the agonizing cry, \"O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:\" but if there is no other way by which the salvation of fallen man may be accomplished, then \"not as I will, but as thou wilt.\" Human nature would then and there have died under the horror of the sense of sin, had not an angel from heaven strengthened Him to bear the agony.",
