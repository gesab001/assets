    "word": "The apostle Paul, in relating his experience, presents an important truth concerning the work to be wrought in conversion. He says, \"I was alive without the law once,\"--he felt no condemnation; \"but when the commandment came,\" when the law of God was urged upon his conscience, \"sin revived, and I died.\" [Romans 7:9.] Then he saw himself a sinner, condemned by the divine law. Mark, it was Paul, and not the law, that died. He says, further, \"I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\" [Romans 7:7.] \"The commandment which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.\" [Romans 7:10.] The law which promised life to the obedient, pronounced death upon the transgressor. \"Wherefore,\" he says, \"the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\" [Romans 7:12.]",
