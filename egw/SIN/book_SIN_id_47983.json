    "word": "But the anger and the frowning countenance of the Pharisees could not be concealed. Apparently their looks expressed holy horror. They began to reason, saying, \"Who is this which speaketh blasphemy? Who can forgive sin but God alone?\" But who was it that had uttered the words, \"Thy sins are forgiven thee?\"--The Son of the Living God.

Christ was in the Father and the Father in Christ, \"I and my Father are one,\" he declared.",
