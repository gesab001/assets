    "word": "I hope that no one will be discouraged in the failure of the hopes and plans concerning this institution. The Lord bestows his blessing upon us when we comply with His stated conditions. He will bless us when we are in harmony with His laws. We may think that there is something wanting that is essential to success; but in time we may see that we do not always attain success when we gain what we desire. You may be tried like gold in the fire, but if you bear the trial rightly, your soul may be more greatly benefitted than if you had had the prosperity you desired. My brother, keep humble, keep a spirit of meekness. You want to be a bold, successful soldier of Jesus. You want to be a valiant overcomer. God grant that you may win the crown of life.",
