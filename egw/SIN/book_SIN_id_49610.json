    "word": "My brethren, many of you have left your first love. \"Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works.\" To those who do not repent, Christ declares, \"I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\" Put away the devisings and theories of men. No longer follow in the light of the sparks of your own kindling. Remember the words, \"Except thou repent.\" \"I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place.\"",
