    "word": "A general movement is needed, but this must begin with individual movements. Let each member in each family in each church make determined efforts to deny self. Let us have the whole-hearted co-operation of all in our ranks. Let us all move forward willingly and intelligently to do what we can to relieve those of our schools that are struggling under a pressure of debt. Let the officers of each church \n\n\n                        -4- \n\nfind out who among the members has been sent to school, and helped by the school. Then let the church refund the tuition money. Let those who have had success in canvassing come up to the help of the Lord. As they handle this book, let them in the name of the Lord work in faith.",
