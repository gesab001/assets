    "word": "In the divine plan, evil was foreseen and provided for. A remedy was provided sufficient for complete restoration. But in this plan man himself must act a part as the created agency through whom God would work. Humanity is the instrument through which God works for humanity. As Christ labored for sinners, so man must labor, that humanity may be brought into connection with divinity.",
