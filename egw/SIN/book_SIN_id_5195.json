    "word": "I see there is danger of some of our brethren saying, as did the foolish rich man, \"Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\" Many are forgetting that they are God's servants, and are saying, \"Tomorrow shall be as this day and much more abundant.\" God is looking on your every business transaction. Be on your guard. It is time that deep, earnest thought should be given to laying up treasure in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, not thieves break through and steal.--Special Testimonies, Series B, No. 17, pp. 4, 5 [\"The Unwise Use of Money and the Spirit of Speculation\"].",
