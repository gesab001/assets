IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THE READER WOULD BE BENEFITED BY HAVING MORE CONTEXT FOR SOME OF THE STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS WHITE ESTATE POLICY TO RELEASE ENTIRE DOCUMENTS WHEREVER FEASIBLE, IN THIS INSTANCE THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PAGES INVOLVED MAKE IT IMPRACTICAL. IF THERE IS SPECIAL INTEREST IN ANY OF THE STATEMENTS, THE ESTATE WILL BE GLAD TO RELEASE ADDITIONAL CONTEXT.]",
