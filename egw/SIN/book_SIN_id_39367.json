    "word": "The Holy Spirit attending the worker, together with God, enables him to gather in the sheaves. It is not learned men, not eloquent men, who are to be depended upon to do the work now needed, but humble men, who are learned in the \n\n\n                                      -33- \n\nschool of Christ, who are meek and lowly in heart, who will give the invitation to the supper, \"Come, for all things are now ready.\" Those who beg at midnight for loaves to feed the hungry souls, will be successful. The law of God is that as we receive we are to impart. All the churches in our land need the self-denying, self-sacrificing spirit of Christ. God's people are no longer to continue in sin; they are to lay hold of the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour. If human hands have never been laid upon them in ordination, there is One who will give fitness for the work, if they ask for it in faith. In the name of the Lord I entreat you, Ask and receive the Holy Spirit. Press to the side of Christ. But this Spirit can only be received by those who are consecrated, who will deny self, lifting the cross and following the Lord. Who will be on the Lord's side?--Letter 10, 1899, pp. 9, 10, 14. (To J. H. Kellogg, Jan. 14, 1899.)",
