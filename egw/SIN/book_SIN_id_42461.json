    "word": "The physicians may have to be there, but there can be women physicians just as thoroughly trained as men. The Lord would have us do everything possible to close the door of temptation. If you knew how many letters come to me, asking what they shall do; and one man offered me a large sum of money if I would give him advice. I did give him advice, but it did not meet his mind. He was leaving his wife and giving his attention to another woman, and I wrote him a letter. He had quite a large sum of money I suppose he was prepared to give me if I favored his action, but I came right out and took my position in the letter that I wrote. But I have not seen the money yet, and I do not want to see it unless it is pure money. There was a feeble wife, sick, and I wrote to him as I thought was appropriate, but I have not received a letter since I wrote as plainly as I did.",
