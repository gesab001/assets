    "word": "When, my brethren, you would accuse one of the brethren, consider the words of Jesus, \"He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.\" Your sin may not be the particular sin that is under consideration, but Jesus's words meant that when you are free from sin you may cast the first stone. When Jesus spoke these words to the accusers, their guilty consciences were aroused. They could not answer Him. They were convicted each in his own conscience, and they went out one by one, beginning at the eldest even to the youngest.",
