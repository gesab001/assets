    "word": "We do not believe in God as we should, and I have thought that this unbelief is our greatest sin. . . . We must not think when we are afflicted that the anger of the Lord is upon us. God brings us into trials in order that we may be drawn near to Him. The psalmist says, \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all.\" He does not desire us to be under a cloud. . . .",
