    "word": "The condition of eternal life is now just what it always has been\u2014just what it was in Paradise before the fall of our first parents\u2014perfect obedience to the law of God, perfect righteousness. If eternal life were granted on any condition short of this, then the happiness of the whole universe would be imperiled. The way would be open for sin, with all its train of woe and misery, to be immortalized.",
