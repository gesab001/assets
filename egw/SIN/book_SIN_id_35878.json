    "word": "The Blessing of Labor. \n\n     Sunnyside, Cooranbong, N. S. W., Australia, \n                                      July, 1900. \n\nTo a Medical Student-- \n     My Dear Brother: You asked me at one time what I thought in regard to your becoming a physician. I am instructed to say to you that the most useful lessons for you to learn at the present time will not be found in a medical course. Your mind needs to be trained to penetrate deeper and to take a more practical turn. If you had connected with one of our health institutions, if you had begun at the beginning by taking a nurse's course, doing hard, acceptable work in caring for the sick, it would have been the best education you could have obtained.",
