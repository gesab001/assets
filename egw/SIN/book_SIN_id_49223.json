    "word": "I am instructed by the Lord to say that Brother Melendy, upon whom has rested the responsibility of managing the various business interests of the school, would, if disconnected from Brother Nicola, have an opportunity to prove himself. The time has come when new plans must be put into operation. Intelligent, capable men are to cooperate in making decided changes in the order of things. And if Brother Melendy feels free to unite as a Christian laborer with Brother Rogers in making these decided changes; if with much prayer and in faith, with all humility of mind, they work in Christlike harmony with each other, the Lord will work with them and give them wisdom and grace to improve in excellency of character.",
