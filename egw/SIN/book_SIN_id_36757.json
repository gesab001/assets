    "word": "The sinner seldom feels right in regard to reproof. He blames the one who opens his lips to speak the words of warning, as though it was a personal matter. In his blindness he fails to see that he is flinging from him, in his stubborn resistance, his last offer of light and mercy. How little sympathy he feels for the one who has carried the heavy load the Lord has laid upon him! He assumes the role of a martyr, and thinks he deserves great pity because he is reproved, and counseled contrary to his own ideas and feelings. He may admit some things, but with dogged persistency he holds fast to his errors, his own ideas. \"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.\" The word of God is rejected in spirit, to all intents and purposes. I have been made to see this same bewitching power now as I have never seen it before,--of hatred against reproof, of stubbornness and rebellion,--to one reproved clings to his own opinions, unyielding. \n\n\n                     [16]",
