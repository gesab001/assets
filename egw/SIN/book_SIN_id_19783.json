    "word": "Canvassing is evangelistic work, and by it great good may be done. Two canvassers should be sent out together. They can help one another to be indeed honored sons of God. \"Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever\" (1 Peter 1:22, 23). How important, then, it is that all who take hold of the work, those who canvass and those who work in the office, shall faithfully preserve and practice the highest, holiest principles of the Word of God. They are to be born again, by the power of the Word of God, through obedience to the truth. They are to know for themselves what righteousness means. . . .",
