    "word": "All who claim to be Christians should deal wisely with the Lord's goods. God is making an inventory of the money lent you and the spiritual advantage given you. Will you as stewards make careful inventory? Will you examine whether you are using economically all that God has placed in your charge, or whether you are wasting the Lord's goods by selfish outlay in order to make a display? Would that all that is spent needlessly, were laid up as treasure in heaven.",
