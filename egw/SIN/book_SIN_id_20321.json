    "word": "To be pardoned in the way that Christ pardons is not only to be forgiven, but to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. The Lord says, \"A new heart will I give unto thee.\" The image of Christ is to be stamped upon the very mind, and heart, and soul. The apostle says, \"And we have the mind of Christ.\" Without the transforming process which can come alone through divine power, the original propensities to sin are left in the heart in all their strength, to forge new chains, to impose a slavery that can never be broken by human power. . . .",
