    "word": "There is not the least excuse for the church to be dwarfed and crippled. Our religious experience needs to be of a higher order, that we may see the greatness of the hope presented to us in the gospel. Christ offered Himself as a willing sacrifice in our behalf. He stooped from His high command in heaven to rescue man from the slavery of sin. The Son of God gave up His honor and glory and tasted the bitterness of death that man might be a partaker of the divine nature. He died that everyone might have a second probation, another chance to choose God as their Leader. He has made every provision that men and women may have an experimental knowledge of the character and work of their Redeemer.",
