    "word": "Will the Lord favor you in the least dishonest practices and indulgence of intemperance that will rob you of calm reason to transact business or to be an agent in business? You will think yourself sharp and cunning, but your reason is sold for liquor. Satan has control of your powers, and the power of self-control will be overcome by the clamors of appetite. Under Satan's training your life will be wasted, and you will become in character that which you did not suppose you would be.",
