    "word": "Brother Haskell and his wife, Sister Hurd Haskell, have been a great blessing to us, but Brother Haskell was called to Adelaide, and I stood alone with Brother Metcalfe Hare to take the meetings on the Sabbath. Brother Herbert Lacey was sick with the fever in Sydney, and we tried to do our best. But as soon as Brother Haskell returned, I dropped the burdens of buildings and church and have been in a state of great exhaustion ever since. I was able to be at the opening of the school. Elder Haskell and his wife and Brother Herbert Lacey and his wife were present. There was a much better beginning than we had dared to hope for. Since that time I have attended meeting but once or twice. But I am able to counsel with my brethren.",
