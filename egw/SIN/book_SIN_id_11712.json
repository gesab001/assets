    "word": "Wives and mothers who otherwise would have had a beneficial influence upon society in raising the standard of morals, have been lost to society through multiplicity of home cares, because of the fashionable, health-destroying manner of cooking, and also in consequence of too frequent child-bearing. They have been compelled to needless suffering, the constitution has failed, and the intellect has become weakened by so great a draught upon the vital resources. . . . If the mother, before the birth of her offspring, had always possessed self-control, realizing that she was giving the stamp of character to future generations, the present state of society would not be so depreciated in character as at the present time.",
