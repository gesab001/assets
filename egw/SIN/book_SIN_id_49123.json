    "word": "In ours, as in Christ's day, there may be a misreading or misinterpreting of the Scriptures. If the Jews had studied the Scriptures with earnest, prayerful hearts, their searching would have been rewarded with a true knowledge of the time, and not only the time, but also the manner of Christ's appearing. They would not have ascribed the glorious second appearing of Christ to his first advent. They had the testimony of Daniel; they had the testimony of Isaiah and the other prophets; they had the teaching of Moses; and here was Christ in their very midst, and still they were searching the Scriptures for evidence in regard to his coming. And they were doing unto Christ the very things that had been prophesied they would do. They were so blinded they knew not what they were doing. \n                                                                           424",
