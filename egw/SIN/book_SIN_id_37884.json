    "word": "The difficulties and hindrances met with in the work in the South are a repetition of the difficulties and hindrances that we met with in the work in Australia, and especially in the work in Cooranbong. And in every other place where the Lord has shown me that a special work was to be done, great difficulties have been encountered. There have always been men and women who were ready to use tact and influence to fashion things after their human judgment, repressing and hindering the work.",
