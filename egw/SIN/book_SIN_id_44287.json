    "word": "The Lord God of heaven claims from us the highest reverence. We are to fear God, to love God, and be obedient to all His precepts. He is perfect in His goodness, and full of mercy and compassion, always working for the good and happiness of the human family; but their own plans, their own imaginings, are contrary to the will and way of God, and of a character to destroy the way of His paths, and make their own finite wisdom prominent in choosing their way and their will. The result is unhappiness, suffering, and eternal disappointment. \"The Lord is good to all: and His tender mercies are over all His works.\" He openeth His hand, and \"satisfiest the desire of every living thing.\" He is the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort. \"The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.\" \n\n                                                                --",
