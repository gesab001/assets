    "word": "Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation \n\n\n     The canvassing work is one of the Lord's appointed agencies for extending the knowledge of the truth for this time. Canvassers have an important work to do. The Lord can and will work through them if they will earnestly prepare themselves to do what they can. The effort made to circulate Christ's Object Lessons is demonstrating what can be done in the canvassing field. To those who are working with this book, I would say, After the immediate necessity is met, do not lose your zeal, feeling that there is no further need for special effort. Sell the book wherever you can, and bring our larger books to the notice of the people.",
