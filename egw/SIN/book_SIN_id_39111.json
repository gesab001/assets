    "word": "Head Physician not Qualified to Manage \n\n\n     In the Sanitarium here we see the great danger of the head physician supposing that he must be superintendent and manager of everything in the institution. We see the results of this here, although within the last twenty years the Lord has sent message after message to correct this supposition. It is not according to the Lord's order to lay so many responsibilities upon one man. God has a work for the physician. He is to work under His supervision, and is in no case to suppose that a physician is qualified to be superintendent and manager, and to make a success of this extra burden-bearing, at the same time doing the work that he should do as a physician. . . .",
