    "word": "His was the medical missionary work that He asks His people to do today. Humble, gracious, tenderhearted, pitiful, He went about doing good, feeding the hungry, lifting up the bowed down, comforting the sorrowing. None who came to Him for aid went away unrelieved. Not a thread of selfishness was woven into the pattern He has left for His children to follow. He lived the life that He would have all live who believe on Him. It was His meat and drink to do the will of His father. To all who came to Him for help He brought faith and hope and life. Wherever He went He carried blessing.",
