    "word": "I entreat our ministering brethren to \"preach the word\" in short discourses that can be easily understood. Carry your message with you in house-to-house labor, and roll upon men and women the responsibility, not only of hearing the word, but of practising it, and of communicating it to others. In harmony with Jesus' instruction, the early disciples went everywhere telling of Christ and His resurrection from the dead. . . .",
