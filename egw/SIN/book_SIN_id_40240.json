    "word": "The greatest tirade may be made against me, but it will not change in the least my mission or my work. We have had this to meet again and again. The Lord gave me the message when I was only 16 years old, and I have been engaged in public labor ever since. Next November I shall be 70 years old. The message the Lord has given me to bear has been in a straight line from light to light, upward and onward from truth to advanced truth.--Ms 29, 1897, p. 8. (\"Counsel and Warning,\" undated.)",
