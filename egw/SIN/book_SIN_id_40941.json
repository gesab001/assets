    "word": "Had the Jewish nation received the Teacher sent from God, they would have given up the traditions and maxims handed down from rabbi to rabbi, and accumulating from age to age as other, non-essential theories were invented. But instead of advancing from light to greater light, they took the wrong way. By sinful indulgence they expelled from the heart the love of God, the love of the principles of His holy law. The love of the world filled their hearts, prompting them to disobey. If they had hidden the law of God in their hearts, if they had given due respect to the sacred principles of this law, it would have exerted a corrective influence on the entire life, and would have remodeled their selfish, avaricious dispositions, after the character of God.--Ms 125, 1901, p. 4. (\"The Unchangeable Law of God,\" December 9, 1901.)",
