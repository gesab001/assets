    "word": "From London to Basle\n     Wednesday morning, September 2, we were to leave London for Basle. Bro. H. W. Kellogg, who had been in London with W. C. White about a week, attending to business connected with the publishing houses at Basle and at Christiania, Norway, was to accompany us. We had determined on an early departure; but this, as those know who are familiar with London habits, was not an easy matter. At eight o'clock in the morning the principal business streets of London are as quiet as are those in most of our American cities at six o'clock; and business men are not to be found in their offices until a still later hour.",
