    "word": "God is no respecter of persons, but in every generation they that fear the Lord and work righteousness are accepted of him, and they that are murmuring, unbelieving, and rebellious, will not have his favor and the blessings promised to those who love the truth and walk in it. Those who have the light and do not follow it, but disregard the requirements of God, will find that their blessings will be changed into a curse, and their mercies into judgments. God would have us learn humility and obedience as we read the history of ancient Israel, who were his chosen and peculiar people, but who brought their own destruction by following their own ways.",
