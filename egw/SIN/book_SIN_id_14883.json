Christ chose retirement, and through a life of industry, keeping His hands employed, He did not invite temptation, but kept aloof from the society of those whose influence was corrupting. Christ placed His feet in the most uneven path that children and youth will ever be called to travel. He did not have allotted to Him a life of affluence and indolence. His parents were poor, and dependent upon their daily toil for sustenance; therefore the life of Christ was one of poverty, self-denial, and privation. He shared with His parents their life of diligent industry.",
