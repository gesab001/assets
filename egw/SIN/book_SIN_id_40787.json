    "word": "What a terrible thing it is to darken the pathway of others by bringing shadow and gloom upon ourselves. Let each one take heed to himself. Charge not upon others your defections of character. My brethren in the gospel ministry, talk light; walk in the light. \"God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.\" Study not how to please self. Lose sight of self, and behold the multitudes in Greater New York who are perishing in their sins. Gather to your souls the courage that can come only from the Light of the World. Forgetting self, help the many who are within reach around you. Do not overwork; for you must keep the vital energies awake. Realize that a work of restoration in your behalf will glorify God. Determine that whatever others may do, you will appropriate God's promises to yourselves, weaving them into the fabric of your daily experience.",
