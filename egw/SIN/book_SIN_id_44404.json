    "word": "Brother Whitney wishes us to go next week to Italy. We are thinking of taking the whole family along; go into Brother Bourdeau's house and remain a couple of months. We want the Lord to direct. It is cold as a barn here. The coils warm the room scarcely at all. It is a failure and something will have to be devised of a different character than this, to heat these rooms. They will put me up a stove in the parlor today. I have not been warm since I came here, and the very air seems as if I were breathing in the air from a snowbank. Edith [Andrews] is evidently failing. The rooms she and her mother occupy are not comfortable. They have a little heating arrangement, not the one I had, but similar to it, but that is not sufficient, and the rubber coils are very disagreeable to Edith.",
