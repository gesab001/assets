    "word": "If fevers enter a family, often more than one have the same fever. This need not be, if the habits of the family are correct. If their diet is as it should be, and they observe habits of cleanliness, and realize the necessity of ventilation, the fever need not extend to another member of the family. The reason of fevers prevailing in families, and  exposing the attendants, is because the sick-room is not kept free from poisonous infection, by cleanliness and proper ventilation.",
