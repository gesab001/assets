    "word": "Saul, after he had disobeyed the requirement of God to destroy the Amalekites, met Samuel, and said, \"Blessed be thou of the Lord; I have performed the commandment of the Lord.\" And Samuel said, \"What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?\" The answer was the same that we have heard in similar cases,--an excuse, a falsehood: \"The people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God.\" Saul did not say my or our but thy God. Many who profess to be serving God are in the same position as Saul,--covering over ambitious projects, pride, or display, with a garment of pretended righteousness. The Lord's cause is made a cloak to hide the deformity of injustice, but it makes the sin of tenfold greater enormity.",
