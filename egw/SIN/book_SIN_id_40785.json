    "word": "Those who are working in this city should be a help, a strength, and a blessing to one another. Each laborer should encourage his fellow-laborer to work to the utmost of his God-given ability. Never should one laborer weaken the hands of another whom God has appointed to work for Him. Satan discourages; God encourages.",
