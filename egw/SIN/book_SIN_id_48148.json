    "word": "Many are now perishing for want of knowledge. Shall we not give mind and soul and voice to proclaiming the truth as it is in Christ Jesus? To every worker I would say, Show to unbelievers that there is strength in God. Communicate your ideas in regard to what is required, by the words of warning, \"Prepare to meet thy God.\" Sow the seeds of truth by all waters. Wake up the watchmen, and, with them, bear the message in words of power. \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\" The increase of your own experience will be proportionate to your individual trust and confidence in God.",
