    "word": "Angels of God are drawn toward all who in their thoughts and devoted service draw nigh to God. . . . It is a great misfortune to be double-minded. \"A double minded man is unstable in all his ways\" (James 1:8). . . . Let us use to a purpose the mind the Lord has given us. Ambition, covetousness, the mania to follow the fashions, the customs, and practices of the world in order not to be thought singular, will soon obliterate all lines of distinction between the Christian's lines of pursuit and the practices of the world.",
