    "word": "My husband has erred in making public the errors of those who were willing to do all they could to lift burdens. One word spoken to weaken the influence of those who are doing their best to advance the cause of God, is no more excusable in him than it was in those who stood ready to repulse his every effort during the earlier stages of the work. God is putting burdens upon more inexperienced shoulders. He is fitting them to be caretaking, to venture, to run risks. Mistakes \n                                                                           27\nhave been made and will be made; but should these errors be presented before the public in contrast with his success, thus arousing suspicious and jealousies that the men whom God is working with cannot be trusted, it would discourage those who were doing their very utmost to promote the interests of the work of God, and would hinder some whom God is moving upon, who would otherwise sustain the cause. Not one word should be spoken or written to weaken the influence of his fellow-laborers, those connected with these institutions, or cast reflections upon their plans and the execution of them, unless some evidence is given that downright dishonesty is endangering the cause of God.",
