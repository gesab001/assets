    "word": "In his work today, the Lord would be pleased to have those who are engaged in any part of His service, guard against the tendency to take upon themselves responsibilities that they are not called upon to bear.  Some of His servants are to direct the business matters connected with His work in the earth; others are to look after the spiritual matters.  Every laborer is to strive to do well his part, leaving to others the duties entrusted to them.--Review and Herald, October 5, 1905.",
