    "word": "This history is given that corruption may not be brought into the church by men who sell themselves to Satan to carry out his suggestions. Such men not only take themselves from under God's protection, and lose peace and happiness, but they will betray the cause of God into the hands of sinners. All their work is against God. Their talents of usefulness are used to forward the work of the great deceiver. They will lose eternal life. Their misappropriation of the Lord's goods, their robbery of His treasury, may ever be kept secret, but it is at the loss of their souls.",
