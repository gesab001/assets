    "word": "Here I wish to impress upon all interested in missionary work that first the truth is to be presented, and the warning given to the people, \"The kingdom \n                                                                           161\nof God is at hand.\" Nothing will so impress the people as the lifting up of the Saviour before them as Christ and him crucified. \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up.\" In the wilderness the word was given, sounded by the trumpet, caught up by appointed men, and the trumpet was given a certain sound. Every one today who is bitten by the sting of the serpent is to look and live. This is the special work that is to be accomplished. Said John as he saw Jesus, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" All who look upon him will live. Then the question, \"What shall I do to be saved?\" is answered.",
