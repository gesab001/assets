    "word": "Brother Haskell, we must pray more in simple, humble contrition of soul. We must exercise faith, teach the people how to have faith. I long to speak to the people in the yearly meetings East. I long to tell them, \"Behold Him, behold Him the Man of Calvary, the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world.\" I long to tell the people that all the exalted privileges granted them, all the love and tender mercy of our God, all the warnings of God's messengers, all the labor and enlightenment of His grace through holy men, will not save one of them. They must save their own souls by their own righteousness.",
