    "word": "When man is a partaker of the divine nature, the love of Jesus will be an abiding principle in the soul, and self in its peculiarities will not be exhibited. But it is sad to see those who should be vessels unto honor, indulging in the gratification of the lower nature, and walking in paths that conscience condemns. Men professing to be followers of Christ, fall to a low level, always mourning over their short comings, but never overcoming and bruising Satan under their feet. Guilt and condemnation constantly enshroud the soul, and the cry of such might well be, \"O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\" Through indulgence in sin, self-respect is destroyed; and when that is gone, respect for others is lessened; we think that others are as unrighteous as we are ourselves.",
