    "word": "There are souls to be revived; many to receive the joy of salvation into their own souls. They have erred, they have not been building a right character, but God has joy to restore to them, even the joy of His anointed.

There is healing, cleansing for every soul who will come to Christ. There is a balm in Gilead; there is a Physician there.--Letter 93, Sept. 30, 1896, to A. T. Robinson, a pioneer missionary and organizer in South Africa.",
