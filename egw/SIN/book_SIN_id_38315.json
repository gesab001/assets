    "word": "PH089 - Spiritual Advancement the Object of Camp-Meetings (1897)\n\n\n     Our camp-meetings are not conducted in a way that will result in the greatest benefit to the largest number of those who attend, and the reason for this is that spiritual interests do not have the prominence which they should have in meetings of this character. Many and varied business meetings divide the attention, and meetings for the education of workers in different departments of missionary work, claim the services of those who should devote themselves to feeding the flock of God.",
