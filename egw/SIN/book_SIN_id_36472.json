    "word": "I am stirred by the Spirit of the Lord to sound an alarm to rally all our people who love God and his cause to come to the rescue of his institutions in Europe, which are now suffering for help. Let those who trust in God and believe his word study diligently to understand their privileges, their responsibilities, and their duty in relation to their brethren in Europe, who have been used by God to begin a good work. If we fail now to do our work as God's helping hand in relieving the Scandinavian publishing house and sanitarium from their embarrassments, we shall lose a great blessing.",
