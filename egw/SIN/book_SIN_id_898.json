    "word": "As Jesus passed the gate of Pilate\u2019s court, the cross which had been prepared for Barabbas was laid upon His bruised and bleeding shoulders. . . . The Saviour\u2019s burden was too heavy for Him in His weak and suffering condition. Since the Passover supper with His disciples, He had taken neither food nor drink. He had agonized in the garden of Gethsemane in conflict with satanic agencies. He had endured the anguish of the betrayal, and had seen His disciples forsake Him and flee. He had been taken to Annas, then to Caiaphas, and then to Pilate. From Pilate He had been sent to Herod, then sent again to Pilate. From insult to renewed insult, from mockery to mockery, twice tortured by the scourge,\u2014all that night there had been scene after scene of a character to try the soul of man to the uttermost. . . . But when after the second scourging the cross was laid upon Him, human nature could bear no more. He fell fainting beneath the burden.  The Desire of Ages, pp. 741, 742.61",
