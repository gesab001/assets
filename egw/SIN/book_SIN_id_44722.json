    "word": "You may say, Has the Lord shown you this peculiar case of Elder Rice and Mrs. Heald? If I had my diary here, written during my last trip to \n\n\n                                     -366- \n\nDenmark, Norway, and Sweden, I could read to you some things therein. In a vision of the night I was passing through the rooms of the institution and saw the very scenes which did take place there in this familiarity, men with women and women with men. My soul was deeply troubled, and I arose and wrote out these things at one o'clock in the morning. I have copied out much of this and sent it to Elder Rice. I have read to Elder Rice, the board, the Doctors Maxson, Dr. Gibbs, and Brother and Sister Heald the things written in regard to Dr. Gibbs.",
