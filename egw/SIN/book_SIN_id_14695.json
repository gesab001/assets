    "word": "The Spirit of Cheerful Service \n\n     The workers in our sanitariums are to be trained for the work for which they are best adapted. But when an emergency arises, \n                                                                           177\nand help is needed, no worker should say, That is not my work. The helper who has the idea that he is only to do the work assigned him, and no more, who feels no responsibility to help wherever and whenever help is needed, should at once dismiss this idea from his mind. He should never feel that a wrong is done him if in an emergency he is asked to work overtime. When extra help is needed, let the workers assist willingly, in Christian meekness, and they will receive a blessing.",
