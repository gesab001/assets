    "word": "Only a small part of that which may be accomplished has yet been done in circulating \"Christ's Object Lessons\". Let not our people think that their duty is done, their work finished. This book is still to be taken out by God's people, and is to find its place in many more homes. Let the same territory be gone over and over again. In this there will be a blessing for the one who sells the book and for those who buy it. Let us take hold of the work with renewed courage. Let God's people consecrate to His service the time and tact that He has given them. O, what a blessing many will obtain from the consciousness that they are working for God. This thought will help them to do their work intelligently.",
