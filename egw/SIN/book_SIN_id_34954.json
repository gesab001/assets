    "word": "All can do something. In an effort to excuse themselves, some say: \"My home duties, my children, claim my time and my means.\" Parents, your children should be your helping hand, increasing your power and ability to work for the Master. Children are the younger members of the Lord's family. They should be led to consecrate themselves to God, whose they are by creation and by redemption. They should be taught that all their powers of body, mind, and soul are His. They should be trained to help in various lines of unselfish service.--Testimonies, vol. 7, pp. 62, 63.",
