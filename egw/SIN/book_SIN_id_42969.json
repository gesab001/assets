    "word": "There is much business going on today. A telegram coming from Pitcairn brings the sad intelligence to Brother McCoy that there are deaths in his family, but [the telegram] does not state who has died. A telegram is sent for answer to the inquiry, Who have fallen in death? Brother McCoy is as one stricken by the palsy. All are seeking to render him all the assistance it is possible for them to give. I conversed with him for about one hour, and I think it did him good. He feels deeply over the intelligence given. His heart seems as if it would break. We had a praying season in union with Brother and Sister Starr. The Lord came graciously near and comforted and blessed the afflicted one. Telegram received from Willie that they would be at the depot that night half past ten. It has been a rainy day. \n\n\n                                    -96-",
