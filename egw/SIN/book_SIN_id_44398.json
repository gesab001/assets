    "word": "Sunday, Aug. 8, 1897. Sunday morning we prepared to leave Summer Hill for Cooranbong. Brother Robb took us in his hansom [A TWO-WHEELED COVERED CARRIAGE FOR TWO PASSENGERS, PULLED BY ONE HORSE.] to Strathfield, about four miles, to save change of cars. We knew he needed the money, for it is very little he receives in his business in the cab line. We had conversation with him in regard to his moving to Cooranbong in order to be better situated to live and support his family. We persuaded him to visit the place and see for himself what was the outlook and the prospect before him. We will pay his carfare.",
