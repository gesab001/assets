    "word": "Teachers can gain efficiency and power only by working as Christ worked. When He is the most powerful influence in their lives, they will have success in their efforts. They will rise to heights that they have not yet gained. They will realize the sacredness of the work entrusted to them, and filled with His Spirit they will be animated with the same desire to save sinners that animated Him. And by their lives of consecration and  devotion their students will be led to the feet of the Saviour. \n\n                                               -",
