    "word": "Chapter 38 \n\n     (Romans 11:33.) God Asks Questions Scholars Cannot Answer.--Men of the greatest intellect cannot understand the mysteries of Jehovah as revealed in nature.

These questions were not asked, supposing that we could answer them, but to call our attention to the deep mysteries of God, and to make men know that their wisdom is limited; that in the common things of daily life there are mysteries past the comprehension of finite minds; that the judgment and purposes of God are past finding out, His wisdom unsearchable. If He reveals Himself to man, it is by shrouding Himself in the thick cloud of mystery.",
