    "word": "Section Nine - The Management of Sanitariums\n\n                            A Noble Work \n\n     The management of our sanitariums involves a great deal. Those connected with them have a noble work to do, and right principles are to be strictly maintained. The workers are to labor for the establishment and support of the work of God in accordance with His appointment, and the spread of the principles of true temperance in eating, drinking, and dressing. To impart knowledge of this character and of the saving grace and mercy of God is the most honorable, noble work in which Seventh-day Adventists can engage. They thus honor God, and advance their own interests for this life and for the future, eternal life. Their example works for the saving of souls for whom Christ gave His life.",
