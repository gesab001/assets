The Personal Application To Individual Christians\n\n\n\n                     The Early Rain Produces Conversion; \n                   The Latter Rain Develops a Christlike Character \n\n\n     At no point in our experience can we dispense with the assistance of that which enables us to make the first start. The blessings received under the former rain are needful to us to the end. . . . As we seek God for the Holy Spirit, it will work in us meekness, humbleness of mind, a conscious dependence upon God for the perfecting latter rain.--TM 507, 509 (1897).",
