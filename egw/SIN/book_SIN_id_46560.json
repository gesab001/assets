    "word": "It is impossible for us to realize the far-reaching nature of God's law unless we view Christ upon the cross of Calvary--the atoning sacrifice. Through the law is the knowledge of sin. God's moral law is the sin detector, and how can we have an intelligent knowledge of what constitutes sin unless we acknowledge God's moral standard of righteousness? He who has the fullest conceptions of the infinite sacrifice of Christ for the sins of the world, and by faith seizes and appropriates the righteousness of Christ as his righteousness, can see the holiness, beauty, and glory in the law of God, and exclaim with David, \"O how I love Thy law! It is my meditation all the day\" (Psalms 119:97). \n                                                                           374",
