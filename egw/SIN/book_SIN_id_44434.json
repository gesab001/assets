    "word": "What is the test of true religion? Knowing and doing the will of God, in accordance with every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. There is a sanctuary, and in that sanctuary is the ark, and in the ark are the tables of stone, on which are written the law spoken from Sinai amidst scenes of awful grandeur. These tables of stone are in the heavens, and they will be brought forth in that day when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened, and men shall be judged according to the things written in the books. They will be judged by the law written by the finger of God and given to Moses to be deposited in the ark. A record is kept of the deeds of all men, and according to his works will every man receive sentence, whether they be good or whether they be evil. \n                                                                ------------",
