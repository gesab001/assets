    "word": "Those who take the lead in these things bring upon the cause a stain not easily effaced. They wound their own souls, and will carry the scars through their lifetime. The evil-doer may see his sins and repent; God may pardon the transgressor; but the power of discernment, which ought ever to be kept keen and sensitive to distinguish between the sacred and the common, is in a great measure destroyed. Too often human devices and imaginations are accepted as divine. Some souls will remain in blindness and insensibility, ready to grasp cheap, common, even infidel sentiments, \n\n\n                        -59- \n\nwhile they turn against the demonstrations of the Holy Spirit.",
