    "word": "To Correct Error and Specify Truth.--I have much written in the diary [WHILE MRS. WHITE KEPT FROM TIME TO TIME A DAILY DIARY OF HER EXPERIENCE, YET THIS IS NOT WHAT SHE REFERRED TO PRIMARILY IN USING THE TERM \"DIARY.\" HER WRITING WAS OFTEN DONE IN RULED BLANK BOOKS, MORE THAN A SCORE OF WHICH ARE NOW IN THE WHITE ESTATE VAULT, AND MANY OF THE MANUSCRIPTS THAT APPEAR IN THE FILE ARE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN FIRST IN THESE BOOKS. SOME MANUSCRIPTS ON FILE BEAR THE GENERAL HEADING \"DIARY,\" USED IN THIS PARTICULAR SENSE. IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THIS TERM IS USED BY HER IN THE TESTIMONIES IN REFERRING TO HER WRITINGS IN MANUSCRIPT FORM. (SEE TESTIMONIES, VOL. 8, P. 206, WHERE SHE SAYS, \"IN MY DIARY I FIND THE FOLLOWING WRITTEN ONE YEAR AGO,\" AND IT IS PLAIN FROM WHAT FOLLOWS THAT SHE IS REFERRING TO TESTIMONY MATTER.)] I have kept in all my journeys that should come before the people if essential, even if I did not write another line. I want that which is deemed worthy to appear, for the Lord has given me much light that I want the people to have; for there is instruction that the Lord has given me for His people. It is light that they should have, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. This is now to come before the people, because it has been given to correct specious errors and to specify what is truth. The Lord has revealed many things pointing out the truth, thus saying, \"This is the way, walk ye in it.\"--Letter 127, 1910.",
