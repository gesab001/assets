    "word": "But to pray in Christ's name means much. It means that we are to accept His character, manifest His spirit, and work His works. The Saviour's promise is given on condition. \"If ye love me,\" He says, \"keep my commandments.\" He saves men, not in sin, but from sin; and those who love Him will show their love by obedience.",
