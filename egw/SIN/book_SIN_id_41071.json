    "word": "An Incident in the Mountains: \n     We have very cool evenings and mornings upon the mountains. This morning we designed to go to Central City [Colorado], about twelve miles. We purposed to take dinner on the way by the roadside. As we were preparing to start, the horses were found missing. Yesterday eve two hundred Indians \n\n\n                                    -122- \n\npassed through. Five horses of Mr. Walling's were missing; also his cow. It was thought the Indians might have stolen the horses. Mr. Walling threw off his coat, armed himself with two revolvers and a bowie knife, and in company with one of his men, started on horseback to find the horses. We were disappointed in not eating our dinner by the roadside. We enjoyed our simple meal, however, very well. About two o'clock Mr. Walling came back, having found his horses and cow. He had no occasion to use his firearms, for which we were thankful. We shall now go to Central in a short time.--Ms 4, 1872, p. 6. (Diary, July 30, 1872.)",
