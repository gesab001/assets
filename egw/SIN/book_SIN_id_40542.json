    "word": "We have been on the road since Sunday morning at two o'clock, five days and four nights. Everything has thus far been very favorable. . . . The care of our children, Addie and May [daughters of Ellen White's niece] has taxed me considerably. Not that the children have been unusual and unmanageable. They are good children. They are universally cheerful and happy and willing to obey our expressed wishes cheerfully. This has lightened my burden of care wonderfully. Were these children as unruly and boisterous as many children in this car, I should be indeed worn out before this time, but their innocent ways and happy laugh are contagious. We cannot be otherwise than cheerful.--Letter 33, 1875, p. 1. (To \"Dear Children,\" September 22, 1875.) \n\nReleased January 23, 1974.",
