We have now quite a little mail for South Africa, copies of letters sent to America. We will be glad to welcome you to Napier. Elder Israel says he shall break up as soon as we do, \n\n\n                                     -138- \n\nso by the first of September Sister Tuxford will be left alone to manage the office. I will now leave this until tomorrow, after looking over the mail.",
