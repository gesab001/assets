    "word": "I spoke the other morning in regard to some coming to the meeting. That is why I wanted them to come. I mentioned Brother Ballenger's name, with Brother Smith's name--Brother Leon and Elder Smith. Now, it was not because I would give you the impression that Brother Ballenger was closing his ears to the truth; for he has been receiving it as he has had opportunity. But I speak of these men that they may know, that they may understand, what is truth; and if they will not hear, if they will keep away, just as the ministers tell the congregations, the stay-away argument, don't go to hear. Now, you want to hear everything. If he has got error we want to know it, we want to understand it, those that are in prominent positions, and then we want to investigate for ourselves. We want to know that it is truth; and if it is truth, brethren, those children in the Sabbath School want it, and every soul of them need it. This is what we want.",
