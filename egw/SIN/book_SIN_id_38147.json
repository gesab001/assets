    "word": "God is not the author of anything sinful. None should fear to be singular if the fulfilment of duty requires it. If it makes us singular to avoid sin, then our singularity is merely the distinction between purity and impurity, righteousness and unrighteousness. Because the multitude prefer the path of transgression, shall we choose the same? We are plainly told by inspiration, \"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.\" Our position should be clearly stated, \"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\" \n\n                          -4-",
