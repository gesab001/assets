    "word": "Shall it be Small Pay? \n\n     When settlements are made with the laborers in his cause, they should not be forced to accept small remuneration because there is a lack of means in the treasury. Many have been defrauded of their just dues in this way, and it is just as criminal in the sight of God, as for one to keep back the wages of those who are employed in any other regular business. It is the worst kind of generalship to allow a conference to stand still or to fail to settle its honest debts. There is a great deal of this done: and whenever it is done, God is displeased.",
