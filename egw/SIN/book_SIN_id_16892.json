    "word": "The Lord Jesus is our strength and happiness, the great storehouse from which, on every occasion, men may draw strength. As we study Him, talk of Him, become more and more able to behold Him\u2014as we avail ourselves of His grace and receive the blessings He proffers us, we have something with which to help others. Filled with gratitude, we communi-\n220\ncate to others the blessings that have been freely given us. Thus receiving and imparting, we grow in grace.",
