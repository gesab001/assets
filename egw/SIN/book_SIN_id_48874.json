    "word": "We were conversing in regard to erecting a store, and One of authority who was in our midst, speaking to several present, suggested the propriety of erecting such a building at a distance from the main building and all other buildings that are now standing there, so that there will be no danger to them from fire. He suggested that changes would need to be made after thorough study, and that the building should be placed where the wind would not carry the smoke and sparks to the main building. Great care is to be exercised in regard to this matter, and intelligence is to be shown in the movements made.",
