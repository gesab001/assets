    "word": "Well, yesterday morning I awoke about two o'clock, and I could not rest; it seemed as though there was an agony of soul upon me, and I could not say anything. I knelt right down before the Lord and I said, You know all about it; You know what the burden is. And I must have something more than this. I cannot carry this load. I feel such a responsibility when I know that men are not walking in the light, when I know that they are going contrary from what God has told me. And it seemed as though there was a light-wave came right down upon me and the peace of God came upon me; and the words, I will be with you; I will give thee My strength, came to me. And since yesterday morning I have felt that I could die for Jesus Christ. And I am not going to worry or put myself under this load; I am going to leave it right in the hands of God. Brethren, do we carry our loads there and leave them? Let us do it. Let us roll it right on the Burden-bearer; and when we have a part to act we will act it. And when you go from this place, Oh be so full of the message that it is like fire shut up in your bones, that you cannot hold your peace. It is true men will say. \"You are too excited; you are making too much of this matter, and you do not think enough of the law; now, you must think more of the law; don't be all the time reaching for this righteousness of Christ, but build up the law.\"",
