    "word": "Madison School an Example of Combining Physical Labor With Book Study--The Lord has given to the Southern field object lessons of different kinds. The education being given to the students at Madison, which trains the youth to build, to cultivate the land, and to care for cattle and poultry, will be of great advantage to them in the future. There is no better way of keeping the body in health than to follow the plan of training that the Madison \n\n\n                                   -182- \n\nschool is carrying out. This is the same kind of work as we were instructed to do when we purchased the land for our school in Australia. The students had their hours for study and their hours for work on the land. They were taught to fell trees, to plant orchards, to cultivate the soil, and to erect buildings, and this training was a blessing to all who engaged in it.",
