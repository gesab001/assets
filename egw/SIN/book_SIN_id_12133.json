    "word": "Have you, have I, fully comprehended the gracious call, \"Come unto me\"? He says, \"Abide in me,\" not Abide with Me. \"Do understand My call. Come to Me to stay with Me.\" He will freely bestow all blessings connected with Himself upon all who come to Him for life. He has something better for you than a short-lived blessedness that you feel when you seek the Lord in earnest prayer. That is but as a drop in the bucket, to have a word with Christ. You are privileged with His abiding presence in the place of a short-lived privilege that is not lasting as you engage in the duties of life. . . . Will anxiety, perplexity, and cares drive you away from Christ? Are we less dependent upon God when in the workshop, in the field, in the market-place? . . . The Lord Jesus will abide with you and you with Him in every place.",
