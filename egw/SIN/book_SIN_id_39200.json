    "word": "We know that the mind and will of God has no control over the world at large. God's countless mercies are enjoyed, His benefits appropriated, and there is on the part of the worldling no recognition of the Giver, no expression of gratitude for the manifold goodness of God. The reason for this is that the principle of truth is absent from the heart; it is not interwoven into the character, for its pure principles are not understood. The apostle says, \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\" (Romans 10:10). What then is the difference between a Christian and a man whose heart is not brought under the controlling influence of the spirit of God? One is fallen upon the Rock and is broken; self is dead, and Jesus lives in him and molds and fashions him according to His own divine image. His connection with God is made manifest in his business transactions and in all the affairs of life, whether great or small; for he keeps the way of the Lord. His affections and hopes are not centered upon the things of this life, but they are set upon things above. The selfish one lives for self, and he seeks worldly honor, worldly gain; he will make it manifest that his hopes are centered upon the things of earth. He will selfishly grasp all that he possibly can to administer to himself, as Satan has done. There are many who have not a good conscience.",
