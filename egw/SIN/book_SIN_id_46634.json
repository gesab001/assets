    "word": "But we are charged, \"Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord,\" for they will come forth to be united with all the saints when Christ shall call the dead from their graves. Oh, I wish to be converted daily that I shall be a living witness on the earth to the saving grace of Christ! May the Lord bless and fit us to do His will, to live for Christ faithfully, to honor His name, and be a blessing to others while we shall live.",
