    "word": "Jesus Christ, your righteousness, shall go before you. He is light and truth. He forgives our transgressions and sins. Then move in faith, and move in prayer. The Lord Jesus is your righteousness. With His presence leading the way there will be no fear of evil. The ever-recurring difficulties do not baffle the wisdom of Christ. \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\" Ask of God wisdom, and He says that it shall be given you. His mercy is full of pardon and grace to all who repent, and His mercy is not exhausted.",
