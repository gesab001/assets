    "word": "In the office at Battle Creek, at Basle, and at Christiania, there is pressing need of translators in the different languages, and the various branches of the work are crippled for the want of competent and experienced laborers. God-fearing workers are wanted in our houses of publication, in our missions, and in our churches. There is need of persons educated in the English, the French, the German, and the Scandinavian. We want a hundred laborers where there is one. The heavy responsibilities should not rest alone upon any one man in any branch of the work. Two or three should be fitted to share the burden, so that if one shall be called to another post of duty, others may be prepared to supply his place. Provision has not been made half as extensively as it should have been against any and every emergency.",
