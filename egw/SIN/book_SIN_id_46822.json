    "word": "Since visiting your house Sabbath afternoon, Aug. 23, some things have rested on my mind to say to you. I have no hesitancy in saying that Anna's visions are not of God. The dreams that the members of your family have had are a deception of Satan. Will the Lord give light through an impure, corrupt channel? - No. This wonderful interpretation of Scripture which you have accepted, came from a man who was wholly deceived. Such ideas as he advanced, such interpretation of the third angel's message and other Bible truths, such corrupting, sensual things, could only come from a mind defiled. My pen refuses to trace his blasphemous pretensions. Here is where you received your light. Anna's visions have no higher source than the ideas you accepted from the blind man Jones. Can an impure fountain send forth pure water?- Never. The imagination of the man was wholly defiled, and yet he presented his error as solemn, sacred truth. Think you the Lord would pass by his people, who are striving to do his work, and impart light to one corrupt in heart, whose theories would lead to moral pollution and defilement of soul and body?- No, indeed no.",
