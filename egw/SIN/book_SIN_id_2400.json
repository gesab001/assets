    "word": "Love of self, pride and self-sufficiency lie at the foundation of the greatest trials and discords that have ever existed in the religious world.  Again and again the angel has said to me, \"Press together, press together, be of one mind, of one judgment.\" Christ is the Leader, and you are brethren; follow Him.  Walk in the light as He is in the light.  Those who walk in the footsteps of Christ shall not walk in darkness, but those who draw apart in unsanctified independence cannot have God's presence and blessing in the work . . . .",
