    "word": "I am glad to report to you that I am recovering my health. I am not able to kneel or to use my limbs to ascend steps or stairs. I can manage with help to climb two or three steps that are not too high, but I cannot do more than this now. I have been here two weeks today and have been strengthened by the Lord to speak to this people five times: have spoken Sabbath and Sunday forenoons. Last Sunday I spoke twice. In the morning I spoke to a good congregation and at five o'clock to our own people on missionary labor. The Lord gave me His precious blessing.",
