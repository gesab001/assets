    "word": "Why should we not expect the Holy Watcher to come into our schools? Our youth are there to receive an education so that they may do all in their power to acquire a knowledge of the most high God, and to make him known as the only true God. They are there to learn how to present Christ as a sin-pardoning Saviour. They are there to gather up precious rays of light, in order that they may diffuse light again. They are there to show forth the loving-kindness of the Lord, to speak of his glory, to sound forth the praises of him who hath called us out of darkness into his marvelous light.

John says, \"I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.\"",
