    "word": "Overcoming Parental Neglect \n\n     Let there be in the institution no continuation of the spoiling received in the home. There will be no hope for these poor youth--wronged from childhood by unwise indulgence--if the policy followed in the home is followed in the institution. Let them be wisely and kindly disciplined, and when it is seen that they are trying to improve, trying to make themselves what they ought to be, let words of encouragement be spoken to them. But let them plainly understand that they cannot follow in the institution the course of self-pleasing that they followed in the home. \n                                                                           179\nIf they are willing to begin at the beginning, if they are determined to master every problem, they will improve. . . .",
