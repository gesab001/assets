    "word": "Angels Minister to Trusting Souls.--The Lord does not readily cast off His erring children. He bears long with them. His angels minister to every believing, trusting soul. Now, when you read these words, believe that the Lord accepts you just as you are, erring and sinful. He knows that you cannot blot out one sin; He knows that His precious blood, shed for the sinner, makes that one who is troubled, worried, and perplexed, a child of God.",
