I wrote in the anguish of my soul in regard to the course you pursued in the [1886] General Conference [Session] two \n                                                                           97\nyears since. The Lord was not pleased with that meeting. Your spirit, my brother, was not right. The manner in which you treated the case of Dr. Waggoner was perhaps after your own order, but not after God's order. The course you took was not excusable, even if his views were questionable. We must not crowd and push one another because others do not see just as we see. We must treat others with Christ-like courtesy, even if they differ with us. Matthew 5:43-48; 1 John 2:9-11;  3:16-18; 1 John 4:7, 8.",
