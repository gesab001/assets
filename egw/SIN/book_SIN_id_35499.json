    "word": "As, seeing the sinfulness of sin, we fall helpless before the cross, asking forgiveness and strength, our prayer is heard and answered. Those who present their petitions to God in Christ's name will never be turned away. The Lord says, \"Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out\" (John 6:37). \"He will regard the prayer of the destitute\" (Psalm 102:17). Our help comes from Him who holds all things in His hands. The peace that He sends is the assurance of His love to us.",
