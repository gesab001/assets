    "word": "After you have gotten B, what then? You have a man who fears not to break God's law, who fears not to break the heart of a kind wife who has borne him many children and laid them in the grave--a wife who has given him the warmth of her affections in youth--a wife he has lived with until they are on the decline of life! Think you after you get this B for yourself entirely, after you steal him from the wife of his youth, he will ever remain constant and true to you, who have accomplished so much evil to satisfy your guilty love? The truth found B a hard case. It was done everything for him. Now he has no fear of God, no fear of transgressing His law, evil angels take charge of his mind and yours, and then how constant and true and even will your love run? You have sowed to yourself misery, misery. Ever more will a guilty conscience haunt you. Is it possible now for you to retrace your steps? Is it possible that a merciful God would pity you yet?",
