    "word": "The time has come when if light is not cherished it leaves the one who rejects it in very dense darkness, and strong and startling developments are made quickly. Things move rapidly now. We are nearing the end. Why, I ask, is all this zeal against me? I have attended to my business, given me of God. I have injured no one. I have spoken to the erring the words God has given me. Of course I could not compel them to hear. Those who had the benefit of Christ's labors were just as enraged against Him as the enemies are against me. I have done only my duty. I have spoken because compelled to speak. They have not rejected me but Him who sent me--Him who has given me my work.-- Letter 3, 1883, pp. 3, 4. (To Uriah Smith, July 31, 1883.)",
