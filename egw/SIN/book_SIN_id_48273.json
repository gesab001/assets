Burden, Loma Linda, Calif. \n\nDear Brother and Sister Burden: \n\n\n     I have just written a short letter to Elder Reaser. When a man exalts himself as Elder Reaser has done, he is in great peril. He is in danger of losing his soul; and the enemy will endeavor to take advantage of his influence and his capabilities, and use them to deceive others, and lead them into false paths.",
