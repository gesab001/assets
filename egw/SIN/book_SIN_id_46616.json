    "word": "The Lord looks with disfavor upon those who would please the men of the world, while at the same time they accuse those whom God is using, and manifest a satanic disrespect toward those whom they should highly regard. The tenderness of spirit, the kindness, the courtesy, the refinement of feeling, that characterizes those who are learning in the school of Christ, has passed out of the heart and life of many who think that God is using them. The True Witness says, \"I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. \n                                                                           444\nRemember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\" If there was far more repenting and confessing and forsaking of sin, and less self-sufficiency, and less self-boasting, we should see spiritual things more clearly. God desires that you come into vital connection with himself, and then Christ will abide in the heart, and a pure flame of devotion will be kindled in the soul.",
