    "word": "Christians are safe in acquiring money as God directs, and using it in channels which He can bless. \n                                                                           336\nGod permits us to use His goods with an eye single to His glory to bless ourselves that we may bless others. Those who have adopted the world's maxim, and discarded God's specifications, who grasp all they can obtain of wages or goods, are poor, poor indeed, because the frown of God is upon them. They walk in paths of their own choosing, and do dishonor to God, to truth, to His goodness, to His mercy, His character.",
