    "word": "The watchmen upon the walls of Zion are to cry aloud and spare not, to lift up their voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sin. When John came to Jordan, it was to arouse the people, to lay the ax at the root of the tree. Christ had not yet come to reveal himself to the world, and John was to prepare the way of the Lord. He rebuked, reproved, stirred men up to repentance, condemned their sin, and then Christ came to pour the healing balm into the prepared soul. When the disciples of John were jealous because Christ baptized more disciples than did their master, he answered, \"A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice; this my joy therefore is fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease.\" Do you think that John had no human feelings?--Of course he did, but he determined that they should have no control over him. When he had seen Jesus on the banks of the Jordan, he had said, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!\" He directed the attention of the people to Christ, and two of his disciples turned and followed Jesus. \"Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, \"Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day,\" Then they began the work of calling others.",
