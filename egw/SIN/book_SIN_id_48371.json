White, \n               Thursday morning, January 27, 1910. \n\n\n     When I called to see how Mother was this morning, and to inquire if she was willing to attend the half-past eight meeting, she began to talk about her interview yesterday afternoon with Elder Evans. Then she inquired about the meetings--how they were progressing. I told her that one of the matters which was delaying the progress of the meeting, was the question which our brethren had submitted to her in writing, about the Loma Linda Medical school. And as the document was lying on her table, I handed it to her, and she read it again.",
