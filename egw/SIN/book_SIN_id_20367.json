    "word": "While Isaiah was trembling and conscience-smitten, because of his impurity in the presence of this unsurpassed glory, he says, \"Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.\"--Review and Herald, Oct. 16, 1888.",
