    "word": "Those who win souls to Christ glorify their Redeemer. He has not died in vain for them, for they are in harmony with Christ. They look upon those who have turned to God through their efforts, with glad rejoicing; for they also see of the travail of their souls, and are satisfied. They see that the anxious hours they have spent, the perplexing circumstances they have had to meet, the sorrows they have to endure, have worked for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. As they look upon the souls they have won to Christ, and know that they are eternally saved, are monuments of God's mercy and of a Redeemer's love, they touch the golden harp and fill the arches of heaven with praise and thanksgiving. They sing, \"Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. . . . Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.\"",
