    "word": "I have been unable as yet to find the writings which you mention, but I may find them, and if I do will send them to you. I will say that the difficulties which have existed in the church are all unnecessary. The troubles exist because of the misunderstanding of what constitutes true Christian charity, brotherly affection, and Christlike love. There is far more self-love, self-esteem, far more talking among men and women than is essential. You have been measuring yourselves by yourselves, comparing yourselves among yourselves, \n\n\n                                   -145- \n\ntaking it for granted that all your feelings and surmisings and suspicions were correct, when if such feelings and suspicions and judging of one another are continued there will be discord, strife, and an unhealthy state of the church.",
