    "word": "In teaching us to ask every day for what we need\u2014both temporal and spiritual blessings\u2014God has a purpose to accomplish for our good. He would have us realize our dependence upon His constant care, for He is seeking to draw us into communion with Himself. In this communion with Christ, through prayer and the study of the great and precious truths of His word, we shall as hungry souls be fed; as those that thirst, we shall be refreshed at the fountain of life.\u2014(Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, 112, 113.)",
