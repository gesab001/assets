Paul writes to the Corinthians, \u201cLet us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u201d [2 Corinthians 7:1.] And with the fruits of the Spirit,\u2014\u201clove, joy, peace,  long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,\u201d\u2014he classes temperance.
