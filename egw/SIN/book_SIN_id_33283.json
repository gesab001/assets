    "word": "But while we are not to be dismayed by trial, bitter though it be, we should pray that God will not permit us to be brought where we shall be drawn away by the desires of our own evil hearts.

We shall wait for His hand to lead us; we shall listen to His voice, saying, \"This is the way, walk ye in it.\" Isaiah 30:21.",
