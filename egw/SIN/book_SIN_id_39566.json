    "word": "Daniel was imbued with the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and he pleaded that the wise men of Babylon should not be destroyed. The followers of Christ do not possess the attributes of Satan, which make it a pleasure to grieve and afflict the creatures of God. They have the Spirit of their Master who said, \"I am come to seek and to save that which was lost. I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.\" Had Daniel possessed the same quality of religious zeal \n\n\n                                    -320- \n\nwhich is so quickly inflamed today in the churches, and men are led by it to afflict and oppress and destroy those who do not serve God after their prescribed plan, he would have said to Arioch, \"These men who claim to be wise men are deceiving the king. They have not the knowledge they claim to have and should be destroyed. They dishonor the God of heaven, they serve idols, and their lives in no way do honor to God; let them die; but bring me in before the king and I will show unto the king the interpretation.\" The transforming grace of God was made manifest in His servant, and he pleaded most earnestly for the lives of the very men who afterwards in a secret, underhanded manner, made plans by which they thought to put an end to the life of Daniel. These men became jealous of Daniel because he found favor with kings and nobles, and was honored as the greatest man in Babylon.--Letter 90, 1894, p. 3. (To \"Dear Children,\" May 29, 1894.)",
