    "word": "God has given his messengers the truth to proclaim. Then the churches are to voice the truth from the lips of the messengers, and use their talents in every way possible to make the ministry a power to communicate truth by their catching the first rays of light, and diffusing the same. Here is our great sin. We are years behind. The ministers have been seeking the hidden treasures, and have been opening up the casket, and letting the jewels of truth shine forth; but there is not one hundredth part being done by the members of the church that God requires of them. They will in that great day be self-convicted and self-condemned \n\n\n                      - 63 - \n\nfor their slothfulness. May the Lord lead them to self-penitence, and to see themselves now, and to exclaim, \"Lord, I am that fruitless fig tree!\" May the Lord forgive his people who are not doing the work in his vineyard that he has given them to do! \"I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.\" Revelation 22:16. Study this subject; read the next verse. We see that this is the very message that has been going forth to the people of God.",
