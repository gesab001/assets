    "word": "There are among our church members many who, while professing to walk in the ways of the Lord, are bringing into their profession the ways and habits of unconverted self, and these are spoiling their characters. So much that is frivolous is brought into the home and church life, that the Spirit of Christ is grieved. There are entire families among us who, unless they arouse from their sleepy indifference, will be lost; for they are not converted daily; they do not understand the divine science of true godliness; and therefore they are not vessels that the Master can use. They have allowed Satan to have the guidance and control of their words and actions, and they do not realize how much harm they have done to souls by their self-exaltation. They have hurt the heart of Christ by hurting those who are the purchase of His blood. I am bidden to say to these unconverted professors, \"Dig deep, and lay your foundations solidly upon the Rock Christ Jesus. It is not enough for us to talk of the higher life. Our daily course of action is to be an interpretation to others of what the higher life means. . . .",
