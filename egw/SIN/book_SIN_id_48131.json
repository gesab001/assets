    "word": "You speak of the sunshine at Loma Linda. It is indeed a blessing. I am glad that you have so much of it. We have hardly seen the sun for two weeks. For two weeks we have had continuous rain, day and night. The rain has fallen gently but continuously, in soft showers, until the ground is full of water. The water in the canyon is up to our bridge, and if there is much more rain, will overflow into the orchard.",
