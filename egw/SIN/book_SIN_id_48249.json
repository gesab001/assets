    "word": "Sister White: Well, here is your danger -- of considering that the whole responsibility of the Conference, the sanitarium work, and all other lines of work, rests upon you, to run them. . . I know that unless there is a change in your manner of carrying matters, a condition of things will come in that it will be very difficult to undo. You cannot afford it, nor can I afford it. In the matter of your raising the money for the school as you have done, you are thereby placed in a relation before that Conference, where they think certainly that you are the man that can carry things through. But the Lord did not mean that it should go in that way. He had provided these books, He had given me the privilege of dedicating \n\n\n                                -293- \n\nthose books to the schools and to the sanitariums. Then He desired that every soul should come in and act a part in making the most of that gift. Every one should learn how to handle these books, and if each one does this, rich experiences will be gained, and blessings will fall upon the workers.",
