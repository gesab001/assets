    "word": "My sister, I wish to say a few words to you. You can be a great blessing to your husband. But you need a work done for you before you can be a blessing to those with whom you are brought in contact. You know little in regard to heart-consecration. Will you not make an unreserved surrender of all you have and are to the Lord? Do not spoil your record by cheapness of word or action.",
