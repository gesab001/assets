    "word": "It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry.\" Proverbs 20:25. \"When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God. \n                                                                           317\nthou shalt not slack to pay it; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee. But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.\" Deuteronomy 23:21-23.",
