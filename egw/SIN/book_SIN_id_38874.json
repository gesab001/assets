    "word": "The cultivation of certain faculties to the neglect of others makes Bro. Andrews a one-sided man. When on the subject of the round world, Bro. Andrews could scarcely think or talk without dwelling upon this subject. He carried this matter to extremes. He wearied the readers and \n                                                                           85\nlisteners to his lengthy arguments upon that subject. Precious time was used up in talking and writing upon that subject, which needed to be canvassed, but did not require so great thoroughness. Bro. Andrews was wearying himself and others, and at the same time was leaving undone the weightier matters. And more recently, months of  precious time have been used up in wearisome labor, chasing after the dishonest quibbles of a man who once kept the Bible Sabbath, but afterward rejected it. His opposition is so great upon the Sabbath question that he is insane upon the subject. The time spent in following Preble so closely and thoroughly has been a mistake. The readers of the Review have become wearied with the subject. A set of quibbles have been furnished the readers of the Review of no special weight only to deceive and darken minds. In these things, Bro. Andrews could not see his failings. He has pursued the subject with the greatest satisfaction to his own mind. Bro. Andrews has needed the help of his brethren. He should have had their counsel. They should have supplied his deficiency by their more equally balanced minds. When Bro. Andrews gets upon a train of thought following a subject, he knows nothing about leaving off when all has been said that is required. \n                                                                           86\nand that is profitable. The people of God are suffering for the truth which he should bring out at once upon the history of the Sabbath. \n\n                                               -",
