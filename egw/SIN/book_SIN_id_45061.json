    "word": "My brother, you need the blessing of the Lord in your home. This is necessary if you would be a wholesome, healthy Christian. Keep yourself under control, or else you will kill your influence for good. Eat daily of the leaves of the tree of life. \n\n\n                                     -279- \n\nThus you will be enabled to glorify God. Speak no hasty, overbearing, dictatorial words, for thus you misrepresent Christ. Strive to reveal in your life the fruits of righteousness. Make earnest efforts, by a well-ordered life and a godly conversation, to perfect the church. Remember that God is looking on and that the world is taking knowledge of you, and that the world is looking to discern in you the likeness of Christ.",
