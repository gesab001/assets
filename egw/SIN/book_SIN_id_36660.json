    "word": "Let the truth be presented, not in long, laboured discourses, but in short talks, right to the point. Do not think, when you have gone over a subject once, that you can pass right on to other points, and the hearers will retain all that has been presented. There is danger of passing too rapidly from point to point. Give short lessons, in plain and simple language, and let them be often repeated.",
