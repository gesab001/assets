    "word": "Man has nothing in himself wherein to glory. Tell it in clear, strong language. All he has, his talent of reason, affection, speech, spiritual discernment, come to him through the mercy of the Son of the Infinite God. These are to be surrendered to God again. Self-annihilation is a hard process, for self struggles for existence, and dies hard. But prayer and faith place the weakest sinner on vantage ground, where the hand of faith can grasp firmly the hand of the Saviour. In and through Christ we may come off more than conquerors.",
