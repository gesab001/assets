    "word": "Jesus has shown His interest in you by an infinite sacrifice, and the remembrance of this calls for intense interest in, and devotion to, one another in our great missionary work.

Satan with his hosts is arrayed against any and every enterprise that will be for the saving of souls. We must bend all our energies to devising and planning how to make the most of the talents found in young men and women, how to educate and train them, not only to become devoted home missionaries, but to carry the truth to all nations, tongues, and peoples.",
