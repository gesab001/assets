    "word": "Then I heard the voice of another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen! is fallen! A light shone upon those desponding ones, and with ardent desires for his appearing, they again fixed their eyes upon Jesus. Then I saw a number of angels conversing with the second angel, who had cried, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, and these angels raised their voices with the second angel, and cried, Behold the Bridegroom cometh! go ye out to meet him! The musical voices of these angels seemed to reach every where. An exceeding bright and glorious light shone around those who had cherished the light which had been imparted to them. Their faces shone with excellent glory, and they united with the angels in the cry, Behold, the Bridegroom cometh! And as they harmoniously raised the cry among these different companies, those who rejected the light, pushed them, and with angry looks, scorned and derided them. But the angels of God wafted their wings over the persecuted ones, while Satan and his angels were seeking to press their darkness around them, to lead them to reject the light from heaven.",
