    "word": "Christ brought His desires and wishes into strict abeyance to His mission,--the mission that bore the insignia of Heaven. He made everything subordinate to the work that He came to this world to accomplish. When in His youth His mother found Him in the school of the rabbis, and said to Him, \"Son, why hast Thou thus dealt with us? behold, Thy father and I have sought Thee sorrowing,\" He answered,--and His answer is the key-note of His life-work,--\"How is it that ye sought Me? wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business?\" [Luke 2:48, 49.]",
