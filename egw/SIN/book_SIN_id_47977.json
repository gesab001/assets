    "word": "The first work for all Christians to do is to search the Scriptures with most earnest prayer, that they may have that faith that works by love, and purifies the soul from every thread of selfishness. If the truth is received into the heart, it works like good leaven, until every power is brought into subjection to the will of God. Then you can no more help shining than the sun can help shining. You have striven to separate from every kind of rubbish, and to let the peace of Christ rule in your heart. But if you do not have the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, you will reveal this by your outward insincerity. You will show this by revealing a heart that is pleased with vanity and outward adornment, by using the means that come into your hands, to gratify the unsanctified soul with idols of some order. How small is the treasure laid up in heaven by such. How little do they communicate to others in sacred ministry.",
