    "word": "When I was only about eleven years old, I heard a minister read the account of Peter's imprisonment, as recorded in the book of Acts; and he read in so impressive a manner that the details of the story in all their reality seemed to \n\n\n               -245- \n\nbe passing before my eyes. So deep was the impression made upon my mind that I have never forgotten it. When, a few years afterward, I was speaking in general meetings, I met this man again, and at the close of my discourse he asked, \"How did you get that wonderful voice?\" I told him that the Lord had given it to me. When I began my public labors, I had no voice except when I stood before the congregations to speak. At other times I could not speak above a whisper. \"And,\" I added, \"I have often thought of what you said to the people when someone asked you how you became a minister. You told them that your friends said you could never be a minister, because you could not speak properly; but that you went away by yourself and talked to the trees in the woods; and then when driving the oxen, you would talk to them just as if you were in meeting. 'This,' you said, 'is the way I learned to speak in public.'\"",
