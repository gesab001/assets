    "word": "We are told that Abraham drew near and said: \u201cWilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\u201d While Abraham had a true sense of humility that every child of God should possess, yet he had an intense interest in the souls of sinners. He is represented as drawing near. He steps close to those heavenly messengers and pleads with them as a child would plead with its parents. He remembers that Lot has made his home in Sodom and that Lot has connections all through Sodom by marriage. Therefore Abraham commences at fifty, and the Lord tells him that He will spare it for fifty; then he goes down to ten, and the Lord tells him that He will spare it for ten\u2019s sake. He does not make any further appeal, but he does hope that there will be found ten righteous [persons] in Sodom.",
