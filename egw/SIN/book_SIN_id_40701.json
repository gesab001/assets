    "word": "In view of what the Word warns us is coming upon the earth, I felt that I must urge upon our people the necessity of establishing Sanitariums. We cannot pray for the miraculous healing of those who know not the truth. They have prostituted their powers, and were they thus healed, they would not return God the glory, but would continue to dishonor him by following wrong practices. We are to educate those who come to our sanitariums, teaching them how to bring themselves into right relation with God by following right habits of eating, drinking, and dressing. . . .",
