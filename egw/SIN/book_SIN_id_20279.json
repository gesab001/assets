    "word": "Obedience--the service and allegiance of love--is the true sign of discipleship. Thus the Scripture says, \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments\" (1 John 5:3). \"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him,\" (chap. 2:4). Instead of releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith only, that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render obedience.",
