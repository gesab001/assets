    "word": "The work upon which you have entered so recently will bring new duties, and the faithful performance of these duties will bring new blessings. New trials will come, new dangers and difficulties. You will have new problems to solve. But though a veil hangs over the future, you have a knowledge of the Lord's mercies in the past. Allow no difficulties to discourage you. You have passed through trials, and you will be called to pass through trials again. You have had to pass through experiences not altogether agreeable, and these experiences may be repeated. Temptations have come to you, and temptations will come to you again.",
