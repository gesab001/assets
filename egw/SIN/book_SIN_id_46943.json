    "word": "Dear Bro. Smith, please to make a surrender to God this time. Make no reserve, and then you will receive the blessing of God. Then peace will come to your soul. You are standing, and have been standing, in opposition to the work of God for the past two years, you have done more than any man living to cast doubt and unbelief of the testimonies of the spirit of God. Now I beseech of you, break and lift the stumbling block. I was shown at Minneapolis that the Lord would come in to their families and would visit for the things that there transpired, with affliction and death unless they stood firm between God and his people. You remember I said in the tabernacle before Elder Butler, yourself, and those present. I had things to say to Elder Butler, but ye cannot bear them now. It was this; his stubbornness and unbelief was sinful and God would bring his afflicting hand heavily upon him if he did not repent and have another spirit, and if he still held his perversity and stubbornness, he would come nearer still to him in affliction. And this he would do to the ones to whom he had given light and they had closed their eyes and ears, and confederated together to make of none effect the warnings and messages of light and truth for his people.",
