    "word": "There is need of prayer,\u2014most earnest, fervent, agonizing prayer,\u2014such prayer as David offered when he exclaimed: \u201cAs the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.\u201d \u201cI have longed after thy precepts;\u201d \u201cI have longed for thy salvation.\u201d \u201cMy soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.\u201d \u201cMy soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments.\u201d [Psalm 42:1; 119:40, 174; 84:2; 119:20.] This is the spirit of wrestling prayer, such as was possessed by the royal psalmist. Daniel prayed to God, not exalting himself or claiming any goodness: \u201cO Lord, hear; O Lord, \n36\nforgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God.\u201d [Daniel 9:19.] This is what James calls the effectual, fervent prayer. Of Christ it is said, \u201cAnd being in an agony he prayed more earnestly.\u201d [Luke 22:44.] In what contrast to this intercession by the Majesty of heaven are the feeble, heartless prayers that are offered to God. Many are content with lip-service, and but few have a sincere, earnest, affectionate longing after God.",
