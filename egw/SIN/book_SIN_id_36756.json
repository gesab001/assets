    "word": "Samuel looked upon Saul with indignation, yet with deep pity and undisguised grief for the sinful course of one he loved sincerely; but this love must not close his lips. He said, \"Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night.\" The kingly head was bent, as he answered, \"Say on.\" Samuel then spake the cutting words of the Lord. Yet Saul repeated his defense,--they saved the spoil to sacrifice to the Lord. \"Hath God as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying \n\n\n                          [15] \n\nthe word of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.\" Smitten with agony and terror, Saul cried, \"I have sinned. . . . Pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord.\" Saul hoped the sentence would be reversed.",
