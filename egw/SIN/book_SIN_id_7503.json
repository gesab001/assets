    "word": "Warning Chicago From Rural Working Center.-- For the present, some will be obliged to labor in Chicago; but these should be preparing working centers in rural districts, from which to work the city. The Lord would have His people looking about them, and securing humble, inexpensive places as centers for their work. And from time to time, larger places will come to their notice, which they will be able to secure at a surprisingly low price.--Medical Ministry, pp. 305, 306. (1906)",
