    "word": "In Bible Times Women Took Care of Women .--I have felt recently . . . that it should be so arranged that the women will have greater responsibilities.  It is their privilege to be educated in some lines of work just as thoroughly as the men are educated. In Bible times the women always took charge of the women, and the Lord worked with them.  I want to say there are many temptations presented \n\n98\nto me by individuals [and] that I have kept my own counsel.  I have not said anything, but it has been sins brought in by this commonness and the temptations that come in.  Now, I know of some that have been tempted over matters.  I know the women for myself.  I know the women are clear, and they are not to be censured, only in one point, and that is to take their stand of propriety and not to mix and mingle right together, the men and the women taking charge.--13MR 114 (1911).",
