    "word": "Although we are now passing through the night of tribulation, we need not be discouraged by the darkness that surrounds us. The Lord desires us to exercise faith, with spiritual vision looking beyond the gloom to the scenes of the morning so soon to dawn. In faith and hope we may confidently say, The morning cometh, when there will be no more night. Soon we shall see the dawn of the eternal day in all its glorious beauty and splendor.-- Letter 136, 1902. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. April, 1987. Entire Letter.",
