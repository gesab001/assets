    "word": "Children who receive this kind of instruction will not be a burden, a cause of anxiety, \n\n\n                    -13- \n\nin our institutions; but they will be a strength, a support, to those who bear responsibility. They will be prepared to fill places of trust, and by precept and example, will be constantly aiding others to do right. Those whose moral sensibilities have not been blunted will appreciate right principles, and will practise them. They will put a right estimate upon their endowments, and will make the best use of their physical, mental, and moral powers. Such souls are constantly fortified against temptations; they are surrounded by a wall not easily broken down. All such characters are, with the blessing of God, light-bearers; their influence tends to educate others for a practical Christian life.",
