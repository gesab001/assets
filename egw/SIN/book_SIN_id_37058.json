    "word": "Christ tells us how in the last great day ministers, elders, evangelists, physicians, teachers, will confront Him with their claims. They will plead how they have led the singers in their songs of praise, how they have waved the palm branches, how they have spoken of Him before thousands. \"Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name,\" they say, \"and in Thy name done many wonderful works?\"",
