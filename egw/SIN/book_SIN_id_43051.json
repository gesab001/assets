    "word": "\"Wherefore, laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speaking, as new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.\" \"Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: \n\n\n                                     -196- \n\nbehold, the Judge standeth at the door.\" Man cannot read the heart of man. His judgment is formed from appearances, and these are often deceptive. God reads the intent and purposes of the heart. Do nothing in an underhand manner; be open as the day, true to your brethren and sisters, dealing with them as you wish Christ to deal with you.",
