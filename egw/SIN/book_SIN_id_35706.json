Many do not care to know; others do not study from cause to effect. Those who hold the reins of government are not able to solve the problem of moral corruption, poverty, pauperism, and increasing crime of every type, manifest in all classes, from the highest to the lowest. They are struggling vainly to place business operations on a more secure basis. The great extremes of wealth and want produce unnumbered evils.",
