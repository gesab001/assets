    "word": "The Religion of Christ an Effectual Remedy.-- Satan is the originator of disease; and the physician is warring against his work and power. Sickness of the mind prevails everywhere. . . . Infidels have made the most of these unfortunate cases [in which home troubles, remorse for sin, fear of an eternally burning hell, have unbalanced the mind], attributing insanity to religion; but this is a gross libel and one which they will not be pleased to meet by and by. The religion of Christ, so far from being the cause of insanity, is one of its most effectual remedies; for it is a potent soother of the nerves. --5T 443, 444 (1885).",
