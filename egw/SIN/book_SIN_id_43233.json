    "word": "MR No. 1195 - By Deeds of Mercy Christians are to be God's Helping Hands\n\n     New Believers Need Temporal Help. The families we have helped to the camp meeting are not a cheap class of people, but intelligent. One brother is the elder of the church at Prospect; another has had a good business, but has met with reverses. These families must receive help all the time until they can get employment. Dollars and dollars I have to expend to provide food for the hungry, and clothing for those too poor to buy. But they are God's property; they have newly come to the faith; they are God's chosen children.--Letter 42, 1894. (Written to H. W. Kellogg, from Ashfield, NSW, Oct. 24, 1894.)",
