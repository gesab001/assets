What blessed converse they have with these souls! \u201cI was a sinner,\u201d it will be said, \u201cwithout God and without hope in the world, and you came to me and drew my attention to the precious Saviour as my only hope.\u201d . . . Others will say, \u201cI was a heathen in heathen lands. You left your friends and comfortable home and came to teach me how to find Jesus and believe in Him as the only true God.
