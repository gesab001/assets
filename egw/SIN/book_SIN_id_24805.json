    "word": "But men cannot with impunity trample upon the word of God. The Lord had declared concerning his two witnesses, \"If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies; and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.\" [Revelation 11:5.] The meaning of this fearful denunciation is set forth in the closing chapter of the book of Revelation: \"I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\" [Revelation 22:18, 19.] \n                                                                           190",
