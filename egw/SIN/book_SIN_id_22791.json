    "word": "In taking upon Himself man's nature in its fallen condition, Christ did not in the least participate in its sin. He was subject to the infirmities and weaknesses by which man is encompassed, \"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.\" He was touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and was in all points tempted like as we are. And yet He \"knew no sin.\" He was the Lamb \"without blemish and without spot.\" . . . We should have no misgivings in regard to the perfect sinlessness of the human nature of Christ.--The Signs of the Times, June 9, 1898. \n\n(456)",
