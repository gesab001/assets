    "word": "Christ has given us an example of the way in which we shall use our influence. He used His influence in drawing men unto Himself. He said that it was His meat and drink to do His Father's will. In how different a way many of the professed Christians of our time act. They consider their own will and their own way as supreme; but the test of human blessedness is a capacity to receive, appropriate, and impart the precious blessings of the wisdom and grace of Christ.",
