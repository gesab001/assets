    "word": "When Sleep Will Not Come, Pray \n\n     June 23, 1892.  Another night has passed.  I slept only three hours.  I was not in so much pain as usual, but was restless and nervous.  After lying awake for some time, trying to sleep, I gave up the effort, and directed my whole attention to seeking the Lord.  How precious to me was the promise, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\" (Matthew 7:7).  I prayed most earnestly to the Lord for comfort and peace, which the Lord Jesus alone \n                                                                           125\ncan give.  I want the blessing of the Lord, so that, while suffering pain, I shall not lose self-control.  I dare not trust in self for one moment. -- 2SM 235.",
