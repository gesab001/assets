    "word": "Less Controversy, More of Christ\nWe need far less controversy, and far more presentation of Christ. Our Redeemer is the center of\n61\nall our faith and hope. Those who can present His matchless love, and inspire hearts to give Him their best and holiest affections, are doing work that is great and holy. By diligence in canvassing, by faithfully presenting to the people the cross of Calvary, the canvasser doubles his usefulness.",
