    "word": "I hope Edson will not get homesick. I received a good letter from Emma about one week since. Received another last night. We answer her letters promptly, seeking to encourage her in every way we can. We do not feel that it would be best for Emma to go to Trall's. We knew she would be homesick and lonely, but Edson, my son, be sure to anchor when you get home, not break over the bounds of health reform. Be settled, and waver not, and Emma will gradually come to the right way of living. She cannot be expected to do it all at once. You have not been a health reformer with firm principles, Edson, on your part. Aided by enlightened conscience, Emma will be all right. Children, move from principle. . . .",
