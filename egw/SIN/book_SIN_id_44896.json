    "word": "Those who have been waiting for the means which they knew was raised for the Southern field have been anxious and troubled. They have had to work in a field destitute of means, and they have been tempted, because they knew the money they should have had was in somebody's grasp, kept away from the Southern field. They have made every effort to earn a little money by combining business and work, but these efforts have brought disappointment; yet much good has been done through the self-sacrificing efforts made. And at the same time those men who should have helped, stood off and criticized most unjustly. God will not hold them guiltless. \"Shall I not judge for these things?\" He asks.",
