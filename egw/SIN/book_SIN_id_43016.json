    "word": "Unrepentant Members to Be Disfellowshiped \n     Those who walk in obedience to the commandments of God are the Lord's representatives in our world. Church members are to be lightbearers. They are to help one another. If there are those in the church who are walking contrary to the word of God, who give no evidence that they are seeking to live the life of Christ, faithful shepherds are to labor for them. If they refuse to come out from the world and be separate, if they continue to walk contrary to Bible rules, they should be suspended from church fellowship, that they may not be stumbling blocks to sinners. If after being earnestly labored with, they refuse to repent and humble themselves before God, let them be separated from the church.--Letter 102, 1901, p. 6. (Written July 21, 1901, from St. Helena, California, to the church at Healdsburg.)",
