    "word": "I have lain awake night after night, turning over in my mind, how we could help the different missions in the best way, and I am in just as much perplexity now as before. I can see no other way but to pray, believe and act as God gives us wisdom. The Lord has gold and silver. The earth and all its treasures belong to Him. The cattle upon a thousand hills are His also. If we trust in Him, exercising living faith, He will send help to advance His work. He has always proved Himself a prayer-hearing and a prayer-answering God.--Ms 19, 1885, pp. 1, 2-6. (\"European General Council,\" September 21, 1885.)",
