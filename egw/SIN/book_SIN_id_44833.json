    "word": "The Lord is a sufficiency. I do not want means to gratify myself, but that I may lead out, that I may have something to invest in the work that should be started in new places, and that I may help those who are cast down and oppressed, who need to be helped to help themselves. This we \n\n\n                                     -77- \n\nhave done in many cases, and the Lord has made us a blessing.",
