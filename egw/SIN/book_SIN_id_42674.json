    "word": "My brother, the Lord sends thee this message in love. Oh, how can it be that God despises us not even in our sinfulness and our deformity of character. How strange it is that man will rebel against His Maker, and boastfully assert his independence of God. How easily could the Lord God of heaven say, \"Poor, weak, foolish man, I will no longer bear with thine impenitence. I will cut off thy favors, and take away thy reasoning power, of which thou hast made so poor use, and will appoint thy portion, like \n\n\n                                     -14- \n\nNebuchadnezzar's, with the beasts of the field.\" But the Lord does not do this. He is patient, longsuffering, full of goodness, mercy, and truth; and for this very reason men presume upon His goodness and forbearance. How few treat their fellow men as God has treated us. They are ready to exact the uttermost farthing, [and are] severe in judgment and condemnation.",
