    "word": "Traveled on Sabbath, Regretfully \n     [En route from Colorado to Battle Creek] Sabbath, November 8, 1873. Rested well on the car during the night. We were unwilling to report ourselves on the cars this morning, but circumstances connected with the cause and work of God demands our presence at the General Conference. We could not delay. If we were doing our own business we should feel it a breach of the fourth commandment to travel on the Sabbath. We engaged in no common conversation. We endeavored to keep our mind in a devotional frame and we enjoyed some of the presence of God while we deeply regretted the necessity of traveling upon the Sabbath.--Ms 13, 1873, p. 2. (Diary, November 5 to 18, 1873.) \n\n\n                                        -295-",
