    "word": "Did you not realize that there was a higher Captain over that vessel? Did you not realize that there was One who was witnessing your words and actions which were certainly an offense to God? Would you count yourself \n\n\n                                     -78- \n\nsafe in a vessel upon the high seas in charge of a commander that did not exercise self-control, and who would at times act as if insane? Had you carried out that which Satan put into your mind, and executed your threats upon the servants of God, there would have been interference on the part of Heaven; for ministering angels were guarding the men who had taken their lives in their hands in order to cross the broad waters and speak the words of life to those who were ready to perish.",
