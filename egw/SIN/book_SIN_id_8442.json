    "word": "The cross of Calvary, while it declares the law immutable, proclaims to the universe that the wages of sin is death. In the Saviour's expiring cry, \"It is finished,\" the death knell of Satan was rung. The great controversy which had been so long in progress was then decided, and the final eradication of evil was made certain. The Son of God passed through the portals of the tomb, that \"through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.\" Hebrews 2:14. Lucifer's desire for self-exaltation had led him to say, \"I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: . . . I will be like the most High.\" Isaiah 14:13, 14. God declares, \"I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth. . . . And never shalt thou be any more.\" Ezekiel 28:18, 19.",
