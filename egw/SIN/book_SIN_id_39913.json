    "word": "[In a letter written September 19, 1903, to Elder George I. Butler, former president of the General Conference, and after a period of ten or twelve years in retirement as he cared for his ailing wife, now the president of the Southern Union Conference, Ellen White counseled the importance of \n\n\n                                    -88- \n\nloyalty to the Spirit of Prophecy and of following the counsels of health reform. She points out the strange situation of those \"who claim to believe the truth\" yet \"persistently disregard light and evidence.\" She urges Elder Butler to guard his strength and not be too quick to hear rumors. Then in one paragraph she makes the solemn statement we give here. The closing part of the letter deals with institutions in the Southern Union.]",
