    "word": "There must be a power working from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness. . . . The idea that it is necessary only to develop the good that exists in man by nature, is a fatal deception. \u201cThe natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:14. . . . Of Christ it is written, \u201cIn him was life; and the life was the light of men\u201dthe only \u201cname under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d John 1:4; Acts 4:12. . . .",
