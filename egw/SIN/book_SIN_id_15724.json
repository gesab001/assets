    "word": "Mealtime and Emotions.--Learn for yourselves what you should eat, what kinds of food best nourish the body, and then follow dictates of reason and conscience. At mealtime cast off care and taxing thought. Do not be hurried, but eat slowly and with cheerfulness, your heart filled with gratitude to God for all His blessings. And do not engage in brain labor immediately after a meal. Exercise moderately, and give a little time for the stomach to begin its work.--GW 241, 242 (1892). (CH 565.)",
