    "word": "I have been surprised and made sad to read some of your articles in the \"Medical Missionary,\" and especially those on the Sanctuary question. These articles show that you have been departing from the faith. You have helped in confusing the understanding of our people. The correct understanding of the ministration in the heavenly sanctuary, is the foundation of our faith.--Letter 208, 1906, p. 2. (To G. C. Tenney, June 29, 1906.) \n\nReleased March 17, 1978.",
