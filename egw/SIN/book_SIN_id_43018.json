    "word": "Those who can see the weakness and mark the faults of an erring one have a special responsibility to try to help him. If they push him off and crowd him away, I am to hold out to him the hand of hope, that he may grasp it, and never let go. I am to say to him. Never be discouraged. I am to tell him of his mistakes manifesting the kindest sympathy. Thus a soul may be saved, and a multitude of sins hidden; for if he confesses his faults, the Lord will pardon him. And from his own experience he will learn how to deal with others who make mistakes.",
