    "word": "I am so much pleased to see this sanitarium fully furnished and in running order. I was glad to see the patients and hear of their improvement in health. My heart rejoices as I review the way in which the providence of God worked to help us to secure this property. The building is home-like and is admirably adapted for sanitarium work; and since the opening of the institution, the patronage has been good. Even before the building was ready, patients began to come. They urged themselves in before those in charge were ready to receive them. It was impossible to refuse to admit them, and the workers have done the best that could be done under the circumstances. A most interesting class of patients have come, among them ministers, lawyers, stockmen, farmers, and state senators.",
