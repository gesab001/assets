    "word": "My sister, the universe of heaven is interested in your human life. Christ is interested in your family. His heart of love is grieved that the talents He has entrusted to your children are misdirected and misapplied. They are not choosing a career that will elevate, ennoble, and sanctify the mind, that will develop a character after Christ's likeness, that will make them such that Christ can unite them with His family in the courts above. I am sorry that the enemy has deceived them, because they are lost to the service of Christ as long as they are thus following a path of their own choosing, and they are bringing hay, wood, stubble, to the foundation, rather than gold, silver, and precious stones, which are imperishable. The very highest honor we each can have is to lift and bear the cross of Christ. That cross is to all who bear it the pledge of the crown of eternal life.",
