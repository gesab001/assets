    "word": "There must be no repulsing of your children when trying to do proper things. If they make mistakes, if accidents happen and things break, do not blame them. \n                                                                           120\nTheir whole future life depends upon the education you give them in their childhood years. Teach them that all their faculties of body and mind were given to them to use, and that all are the Lord's, pledged to His service. To some of these children the Lord gives an early intimation of His will. Parents and teachers, begin early to teach the children to cultivate their God-given faculties.",
