    "word": "Character of Counselors \n\n     In His instruction to Moses the Lord very plainly set forth the character of those who were to fill important positions as counselors. They are to be \"able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness.\" The Lord's counsel has been strangely neglected. There are men in places of holy trust who, when \n                                                                           342\nreproved, have cared nought for it. Some who for years have stood as counselors have boldly stated that they would not receive the testimonies given. [SEE APPENDIX.] In triumph they have declared that many of our most responsible men have lost faith in the message coming from Sister White. Thus the rejecters of light have been strengthened in their unbelief, feeling that they had quite a strong confederacy. Men who have had the light have walked contrary to the light. These words are appropriate: \"Truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.\" The malaria of unbelief has been diffusing its deathly atmosphere throughout the ranks, nigh and afar off. All this has been stated plainly, yet for years matters have been left unchanged. Can the Lord's favor be expected under such circumstances? . . .",
