    "word": "MR No. 1410 - Do Not Establish Business Interests in Large Cities; Live Outside the Cities\n\n     (Written June 29, 1905, from the San Jose, California, campground, to church members in Melbourne, Australia.) \n\n\n     The Lord has given me a message for some of our brethren and sisters in Melbourne who are acting out, in words and works, the same objectionable things that have been acted out by some of our people in Battle Creek. Had our brethren in Battle Creek followed the Lord wisely, the large sanitarium would not have been rebuilt in the same place. Smaller plants would have been made in different places, out of the cities.",
