    "word": "The angel inquires of him the reason of his anger, and informs him that if he does well, and follows the directions God has given, He will accept him, and respect his offering. But if he will not humbly submit to God's arrangements, and believe and obey Him, He cannot accept his offering. The angel tells Cain that it was no injustice on the part of God, or partiality shown to Abel; but that it was on account of his own sin, and disobedience of God's express command, why He could not respect his offering\u2014and if he would do well he would be accepted of God. . . . But even after being thus faithfully instructed, Cain did not repent. . . . In his jealousy and hatred he contends with Abel, and reproaches him. . . . While Abel justifies the plan of God, Cain becomes enraged, and his anger increases and burns against Abel, until in his rage he slays him.\u20143SG 47-49.",
