    "word": "March I. Unsanctified Confederacies.--- I have been shown that love for Christ and for God has well-nigh died out of our churches. And because we do not love God, we are lacking in love for one another. A cold, iron-like spirit separates believers from God and from one another. Some show special attention to a few favorites, who uphold and sustain \n                                                                           581\nthem. Men are binding themselves together in unsanctified confederacies. Their union is displeasing to the Lord. They have united to carry out plans that are not in harmony with the plans of God. The Lord can and will break up these selfish confederacies. They are a snare of Satan, to weaken the cause of present truth, to bring about a condition of things that will separate God's people from Him.",
