    "word": "\"How much owest thou unto my Lord?\" Compute this you can not. Since all that you have is his, will you withhold from him that for which he asks? When he calls for it, will you selfishly grasp it as your own? Will you keep it back, and apply it to some other purpose than the salvation of souls? It is in this way that thousands of souls are lost. How can we better show that we appreciate God's sacrifice, his great donation to our world, than by sending forth gifts and offerings, with praise and thanksgiving from our lips, because of the great love wherewith he has loved us, and drawn us to himself?",
