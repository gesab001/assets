    "word": "[Matthew 11:20-27, quoted.] \n     This is Bible truth. And of those who have clung to their own hereditary and cultivated tendencies, I can only say, They must have the converting power of God before they can be a blessing to others. Unless they are converted daily, they will have a continual warfare with self. They may plead for their own way, but their way is not always the right way. They must fall upon the Rock, and be broken. There is hope for them if they will heed the gracious invitation: \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly \n\n\n                                    -375- \n\nin heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" [Matthew 11:28-30].--Letter 410, 1907. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Sept. 8, 1988. Entire Letter.",
