    "word": "The inhumanity of man toward man is our greatest sin. God is yet present in our world to work through the children of men, and He would not have His people imitate the practices of the Jewish nation. They would not then be a wholesome, saving element in the world. Jesus says, \"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted?\" [Matthew 5:13] \"Without Me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples. As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you: continue ye in My love\" [John 15:5-9]. Now the condition, \"If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love: even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love. These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is My commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you\" [John 15:10-12]. \n\n\n                                     -105-",
