Do you believe that this is the period in which we are to labor as never before for the salvation \n                                                                           1499\nof sinners? How much better you would have been employed in doing this class of work than in taking up lines of work which the Lord never set you to do. Who, I ask, in your councils, in your Foreign Missionary Board, are Christians, in heart and soul? O that every one of you could serve for a time in foreign countries. Then you would know, much better than you now do, what self-denial and self-sacrifice mean. And if you were permitted to return, you would work much more diligently, intelligently. Your nay and your yea would be spoken with a much graver burden, and with a sense of the responsibility involved. But as yet, you have not touched even the border. The indifference with which decisions are made in regard to these things, is an offense to God.",
