    "word": "Now look away from every discouraging presentation, because we have a living Christ, to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him. The bank of heaven has not failed, you have not overdrawn: \"For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.\" \"Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins and then for the people's, for this he did once when he offered himself, for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity, but the Word of the oath, which was since the Law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated forevermore.\" Hebrews 10:14. \"For by one offering He hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us; for after that he had said before, This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.\" Hebrews 10:19-24; 6:17-20. Let your faith be strong in God. Look not upon appearances at this time. Chap. 2:16-18. Brethren Sutherland and Magan, God is testing your faith, but let not your faith fail. Cling to the promises, with full faith, in the One back of the promise.",
