    "word": "Cling to Jesus, your Redeemer. He has given you continual evidences of His love in that He has given you adversity time and again. If we cannot bear these lighter trials, if a little lift of prosperity or adversity discover in us falseness, pride, and selfishness in the heart, if we yield to discouragement and to sin, if the scoffs and frowns of wicked men afflict us and take away our courage and hope, and we faint in the day of adversity, O, how shall we stand when He appeareth? . . .",
