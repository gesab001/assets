    "word": "Will the presidents of conferences and the ministers of the people seek the Lord earnestly, put away their sins, empty their souls of their idols, or will they continue to go on halfhearted, neglecting solemn duties, while Satan triumphs, whispering to his evil angels, and to his human confederacy in evil, \"hopeless, irredeemable bankruptcy\"? Let there be no more wasted hours, neglected duties, despised privileges. Open your eyes to what is taking place around you in the signs of the times. The warnings of God have been given; why not heed them?--Manuscript 8, 1892, pp. 7,8.",
