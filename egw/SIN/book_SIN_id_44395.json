    "word": "Sept. 14, 1900. We are nearing Honolulu. Last night was very hot, and must have been oppressive for those who are not so favorably situated as we are. We have two portholes in our cabin, and we had these and the door wide open. Willie came in early this morning, saying that he had been up since four o'clock. I feel thankful that today there is a cool breeze. It is now about seven o'clock, and we are in sight of the Hawaiian Islands. We hope to reach the harbor in an hour. We do not leave again until six o'clock this evening, and we shall all be glad to have a few hours on land. The captain tells us that we shall reach San Francisco at seven o'clock on Friday morning.",
