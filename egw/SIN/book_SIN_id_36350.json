    "word": "If you will but improve upon the light that has already been given, the Lord will send you more light by whom he will send; but you are too easily satisfied; you do not push forward your investigations into all the lines of truth that have been given of God. When a message comes to you bearing the signet of heaven, you rejoice in the light, but fail to receive the full blessing of God, because you do not sink the shaft deeper into the mines of truth. You think that the subject has been exhausted, when it has scarcely begun to unfold. When you present the truth to others, you make the same mistake; for when a certain impression has been made, you imagine that the object of the work has been reached, when the plowshare of truth has only stirred the surface of the fallow ground of the heart. You think that when good emotions are manifested, when earnest  resolves are expressed, the work is done; but you are to watch for souls as they who must give an account, and see that the heart is sanctified, that the character is moulded after the divine model. You are to visit the flock; the weak and sick, the lame and halting, are to be tenderly nursed; God will not excuse anyone in neglecting this work.",
