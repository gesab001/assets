    "word": "How sad it is that through our indifference to our eternal interests we are far from Christ. . . . We do not see the glory of God shining upon every round of the ladder; we do not climb up by Christ, making advancement in the divine life. If we did this, we should reflect the image of Christ, have purity of character, and become like lights in the world. We should constantly behold Him, until we should be charmed with the graces of His character; then we would not fail to talk of Him and His love. We should then be in possession of rich blessings which the world cannot give or take away, and we should lose our relish for sin (ibid., Dec. 15, 1890). \n                                                                           240",
