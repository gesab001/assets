    "word": "Christ presents the remedy to Nicodemus: \"Verily, verily I say unto thee, Ye must be born again.\" These words are addressed to thousands in this age. Verily, verily I say unto thee, self-righteous sinner against God, yet claiming to know the truth, Ye must be born again. The Lord says, \"Behold, I make all things new.\" If any man be in Christ he is a new creature; old things have passed away, and behold, all things have become new.\" The patchwork religion is not of the least value with God. He requires the whole heart. No part of it is to be reserved for the development of hereditary or cultivated tendencies to evil. To be harsh, to be severe, too self-important, selfish, to look out for ones own selfish interest and yet be zealous that others shall deal unselfishly, is a religion which is an abomination to God. Many have just such an experience daily, but it is a misrepresentation of the character of Christ. \n                                                                           1313",
