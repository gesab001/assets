    "word": "Because this message is not agreeable to their inclination or welcome to those who must be warned, ministers are solemnly charged to be faithful in its declaration. They will meet wrongs that seem to defy correction. They will be made aware of sins that seem to be covered that will need to be exposed. The prophet says: \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their God.\" \"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom: Preach the word, be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\" The minister is not to indulge in the relation of anecdotes, but he is to preach the Word. \"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.\" \"Be thou an example of the believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\" \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\"",
