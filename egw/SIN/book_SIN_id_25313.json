    "word": "In the evening the labor left us who had come to the place, and the brethren and sisters in Wawkon [Waukon] had the burden rolled upon them, and they labored for each other with zeal and with the power of God upon them. Countenances that looked sad when we came to the place, now shone with the heavenly anointing. It seemed that angels from heaven were passing from one to the other in the room, to finish the good work which had commenced. Bro. J. N. L., who had left the work to which God had called him, and had begun to work at his trade, cried out, that he had laid up his hammer, that he had driven the last nail. We soon bid our brethren in Wawkon [Waukon] farewell, and started on our homeward journey. Bro. J. N. L. was again at liberty to labor in the gospel field.",
