    "word": "After I got through talking it was time for the lecture to commence so none made any remarks. In the afternoon after James talked, Brother Baker arose; none knew what he was about to say. He told them that every word of the vision related in the forenoon concerning him was truth--just exactly as it was. (I saw in vision that Brother Baker had not had any bitter feelings towards us like some others.) He referred to this in particular, he knew it to be just so. \"Well now,\" says he, \"you will say, 'What is Brother Baker going to do with the visions?'\" I will tell you. It is high time for me to decide there is no halfway work about this business; the visions are all of God or there is none of them of God. 'Well,' say you, 'What is Brother Baker going to do?'  Believe the visions. I see that they are inseparably connected with the third angel's message and if I give up the visions I must give up the third angel's message; and if I give up the third angel's message I give up that we have had, the first and second; and if I give up that we have had, the first, second, and third angel's messages, I give up the word of God, my Christian experience, and am an infidel at once.\"",
