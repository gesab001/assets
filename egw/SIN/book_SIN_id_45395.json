    "word": "Fannie has treated me badly; she has hurt my soul. But if she should fall into Satan's snare, what bitter reflections might come to me if she had lifted her hand to me, and I would not take it. I shall now without delay say, \"Fannie, I am, in Christ's stead to heed your requests, and connect you again with His work. I do not ask for promises.

Behold the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world.\"",
