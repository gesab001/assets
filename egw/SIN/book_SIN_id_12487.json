    "word": "Now is the time when we are to confess and forsake our sins, that they may go beforehand to judgment and be blotted out. Now is the time to \"cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God\" (2 Corinthians 7:1). It is dangerous to delay this work. Satan is even now seeking by disasters upon sea and land to seal the fate of as many as possible. What is the defense of the people of God at this time? It is a living connection with heaven. If we would dwell in safety from the noisome pestilence, if we would be preserved from dangers seen and unseen, we must hide in God; we must secure the protecting care of Jesus and holy angels.",
