    "word": "There are tens of thousands of colored people in America, and their needs are to be considered. The reformatory work, the educational work among this people has not been done as it might have been done, if those \n\n\n                                  -323- \n\nprofessing to believe the truth had not taken a course of action which has created conditions that have blocked the way. The work of the third angel might have been advanced one-hundred-fold in its various branches, had all done faithfully the work as God appointed them. The work for the colored people has been bound about. Only a small portion of that which God desired to do for them has been done. This people are ignorant, and those who have had more light have done but little to enlighten their fellow men.",
