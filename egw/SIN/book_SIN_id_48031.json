C. \n                                     July 15, 1904. \n\nDear Brother Burden:-- \n     Last night I was unable to sleep past twelve o'clock. I was given an important message to bear. I have been writing out the instruction that was given me, and will send you a copy of this when it is ready. I shall no longer hold my peace. I am bidden to cry aloud, and spare not. I have tried in every way to bring about the needed reformation, and save the souls of those who are following a wrong course. But I cannot go on as I have been going. When every effort has been made to save their souls, and yet all is in vain, we must cry aloud and spare not, lest our silence be interpreted to mean consent. The time has come when each one must stand in his lot and place, prepared to call sin, sin, and righteousness, righteousness.",
