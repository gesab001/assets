    "word": "Says the prophet: \u201cBlessed is he that readeth\u201d\u2014there are those who will not read; the blessing is not for them. \u201cAnd they that hear\u201d\u2014there are some, also, who refuse to hear anything concerning the prophecies; the blessing is not for this class. \u201cAnd keep those things which are written therein\u201d \u2014many refuse to heed the warnings and instructions contained in the Revelation. None of these can claim the blessing promised. All who ridicule the subjects of the prophecy, and mock at the symbols here solemnly given, all who refuse to reform their lives, and prepare for the coming of the Son of man, will be unblest.",
