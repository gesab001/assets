    "word": "What the People Need. \n\n     Everywhere there are hearts that are crying \n\n\n                     - 29 - \n\nout for the Living God. The people have been fed with distasteful food. Discourses unsatisfying to their hungry souls have been given in the churches. In these discourses there is not that divine manifestation which touches the mind and creates a glow in the soul. The hearers cannot say, \"Did not our heart burn within us, while He talked with us by the way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures?\"  Much of the teaching given is powerless to awaken the transgressor or convict souls of sin. The people who come to hear the Word need a plain, straightforward presentation of truth. Some who have once tasted of the word of God have dwelt long in an atmosphere where there is no God, and they long for the Divine presence.",
