    "word": "\"And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment \n\n\n                                   - 5 - \n\nupon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaking great swelling words, having man's persons in admiration because of advantage. But beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: how that they told you there would be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their ungodly lusts. These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.\"",
