    "word": "The straight testimony must live in Monterey, even if it cuts off the right arm and plucks out the right eye. God calls for straight and thorough work. He is purifying unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. The Lord wants Brother B to be a pillar in His church and adorn His cause. God has given him an excellent spirit which He calls him to exercise in His church. If Satan can destroy his usefulness, his object is gained. He must watch against Satan's devices, and stand with firmness and decision, possessing freedom of spirit. He must wrestle for victory, press for the light, and leave all darkness behind.",
