    "word": "Every man's experience testifies to the truth of the words of Scripture: \"The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest.\". . . Sin has destroyed our peace. . . . The masterful passions of the heart no human power can control. We are as helpless here as were the disciples to quiet the raging storm. But He who spoke peace to the billows of Galilee, has spoken the word of peace for every soul. However fierce the tempest, those who turn to Jesus with the cry, \"Lord, save us,\" will find deliverance. His grace, which reconciles the soul to God, quiets the strife of human passion, and in His love the heart is at rest. \"He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. . . . So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.\". . .",
