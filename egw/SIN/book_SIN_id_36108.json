    "word": "The vast fabric that has been woven by our medical missionary leaders into the web of God's cause for these last days, bears not in many respects the decided marks of God's direction. The pattern is positively forbidding; and if the whole history of God's dealings with these leaders should be revealed, as it may have to be, then there would be brought to view matters the publication of which years ago would have set the people right. Long has God borne with the erring, and the people know but little about the instruction and the admonitions that have been given; hence they have been unable to understand clearly all features of the present controversy. Strong representations have been made by those whose course God has reproved, and thus most objectionable features have been made to appear against those whom God has been using for the salvation of our medical missionary leaders.",
