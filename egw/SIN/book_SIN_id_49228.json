    "word": "Let us remember what is due to our Christian profession, and let us be careful not to place stumbling blocks in the way of sinners. Let not our teachers neglect those things that should have a prominent place in the training of all students. The ability to see and remedy defects in the fixtures of the home or the farm is necessary to a complete education. Teach the students to watch for repairs that need to be made and to keep things up in proper shape.",
