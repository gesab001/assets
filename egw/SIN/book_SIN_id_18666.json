    "word": "Lifted standard\n     What privileges and blessings are granted to those who have obtained like precious faith with the disciples of Christ. Nothing is withheld from them. The apostle says, \u201cHis divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.\u201d The standard is lifted up before us higher and still higher, and yet we are to reach it individually. We may attain unto glory and virtue, though weak, sinful mortals, by learning daily lessons in the school of Christ, by becoming conformed to the divine image, by manifesting His excellency of character, by adding grace to grace, by climbing round by round the ladder heavenward, by becoming complete in the Beloved. As we shall work upon the plan of addition, by faith adding grace to grace, God will work upon the plan of multiplication, and multiply His grace and peace unto us. We are to be diligent students in the school of Christ, having a knowledge of His will, and becoming active laborers in His vineyard.",
