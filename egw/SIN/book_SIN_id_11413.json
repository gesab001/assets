    "word": "THE FUTURE KINGDOM IN MINIATURE.\u2014Moses upon the mount of transfiguration was a witness to Christ\u2019s victory over sin and death. He represented those who shall come forth from the grave at the resurrection of the just. Elijah, who had been translated to heaven without seeing death, represented those who will be living upon the earth at Christ\u2019s second coming, and who will be \u201cchanged, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump;\u201d when \u201cthis mortal must put on immortality,\u201d and \u201cthis corruptible must put on incorruption.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:51-53. Jesus was clothed with the light of heaven, as He will appear when He shall come \u201cthe second time without sin unto salvation.\u201d For He will come \u201cin the glory of His Father with the holy angels.\u201d Hebrews 9:28; Mark 8:38. The Saviour\u2019s promise to the disciples was now fulfilled. Upon the mount the future kingdom of glory was represented in miniature\u2014Christ the King, Moses a representative of the risen saints, and Elijah of the translated ones.\u2014DA 421, 422.",
