    "word": "But there have been solemn duties neglected in accepting ministers to labor in word and doctrine who can only preach. They do not watch for souls as they that shall give an account. They sermonize; but the work is left undone which the sheep and lambs need to have done for them. And this half-hearted kind of work has been done all through America, and money paid to men employed, when they should have been dismissed to find work less responsible and care taking. In sending men to foreign fields, let there be great caution used. Those who have been accepted as preachers, and have not been educated to watch for souls as they that must give an account, are not the men to enter new fields as missionaries. If there is any corner of the world where churches can be built up and kept in a prosperous condition by sermonizing, while they neglect personal labor, I have yet to learn of this. \n\n\n                         -18- \n\nMen who are accepted to preach, and not to minister, should not go into foreign countries. Better have one thorough shepherd who will care for the flock as a faithful shepherd should, than to have twenty sermonizers who will excuse themselves, saying, \"It is not in my line to visit; I cannot visit the church in their families.\" Then let there not be a moment's hesitation in telling them, \"We do not propose to accept you and give you credentials. You cannot labor. But educate yourself to do a shepherd's work, to care for the sheep and lambs, and you will not be like Ephraim, 'a cake unturned.' You will give full proof of your ministry.\" Those who can only preach, are not missionaries, and never can be, until they learn the skill, the watchful, tender compassion of a shepherd. The flock of God have a right to expect to be visited by their pastor, to be instructed, advised, counseled, in their own homes. And if a man fails to do this part of the work, he can not be a minister after God's order. The churches that have such labor are disorganized, weak, and sickly, and ready to die. The sermons are not vitalized by the Spirit of God, because the blessing of God will not rest upon any man who is neglecting the flock of God.",
