    "word": "The transformation in our book making has not brought with it a corresponding transformation of character. The almost endless succession of wearisome research and delay and anxiety, and the great expense in increasing facilities to multiply illustrations is simply leading in advance in a species of idolatry. Harmonious spirit and action are not brought into the work, but instead rivalry and strife. The purse is strained to meet the demand; irrespective of the outlay, pictures must be obtained to meet the tastes of canvasser, publisher, and author. Spiritual rest is not secured by us because men do not yoke up with Christ to learn His meekness and lowliness of heart.",
