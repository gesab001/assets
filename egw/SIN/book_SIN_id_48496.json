    "word": "Deceived Men Oppose God's Law \n\n     Satan is so deceiving men that many believe they are doing right in opposing the law of Jehovah.

All who unite on the side of righteousness in the conflict of good against evil will come into decided conflict with satanic forces; but this should not discourage the servant of God.",
