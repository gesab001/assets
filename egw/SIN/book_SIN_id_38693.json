    "word": "I went into the bakery, and there saw an error in the work. It was done with more regard for appearance than for the health of those who should partake of the food. I tasted of the bread,--it was sour; of the crackers,--they were sour; and this was the kind of food to be given to sick people. Sweet, nice bread could not be obtained. Fashion, with its unhealthful evils, was brought into the very institution for curing the sick. Bread should be prepared in the most natural way, and the greatest pains should be taken to make it good and sweet. Here is a field to exercise care and skill and faithfulness. Sour bread injures the digestive organs, and makes a bad qualify of blood. \n                                                                           92\nThere is the most positive necessity for reforms in cooking. With proper care, bread may as well be made sweet as to be left to become sour in rising. In order to be properly prepared for the stomach, bread should be thoroughly baked, as well as perfectly sweet. Joseph Smith does not act from principle in his bread-making, and he is preparing it in a manner to produce disease, which results in great suffering. This need not be. It is an indulgence of pride, to gratify the desire for approbation. If there are any who cannot in their position of duty, firmly and conscientiously carry out reforms at the Sanitarium, they should be discharged, and others employed who will not follow in fashion's wake, but will, from conscientious motives, be willing to be singular. Bread is the staff of life; that which we eat is to be converted into blood, nerve, and muscle; and it is of the greatest consequence that bread be prepared in the most healthful manner. Until this object has been fully gained, there should be persevering efforts to bring about a reform.",
