    "word": "In the Bible the truth is compared to treasure hid in a field, the which, when a man hath found, he hideth; and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. He desires the privilege of searching every part of the field, that he may make himself the possessor of all its treasures. I call upon my brethren in the name of the Lord to sink the shaft deep into the mines of truth. Ms 35, 1901. (\"Consumers, but not Producers, April 25, 1901.)",
