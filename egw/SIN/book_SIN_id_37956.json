    "word": "God marks the neglect of portions of his vineyard, and he writes against the names of many of his workers, Unfaithful stewards. God would have had the facilities that have been continually increasing in America divided and subdivided. He has invested men with power, but they have worked at cross purposes with him. They have disregarded his warnings, and walked in the sparks of their own kindling. These will be called to account for the warnings and light which they have received, but have not heeded.",
