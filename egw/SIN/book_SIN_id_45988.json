    "word": "It is our privilege to know something in regard to this book that many ministers say cannot be understood. To many, the Revelation is a closed book. But we are to know \"what saith the Scriptures,\" and we are also to understand their meaning. We should understand the book of Revelation much better than we do. The blessing pronounced upon those who read, and hear, and keep the words of this prophecy may be ours. If we take up the study of this book in a receptive frame of mind, with hearts susceptible to divine impressions, the truths revealed will have a sanctifying influence upon us.",
