    "word": "In the night season God has revealed to me the spiritual condition of the church members living in Oakland and the nearby cities. A large standard was raised up at a time when many were complaining and finding fault and speaking to the detriment of one another; and this standard was turned around until it appeared before them as a great looking glass, from the face of which everyone that looked saw himself with all his faults and sins. The whole erring company, convicted of the sinfulness of their course, prostrated \n\n\n                                       -364- \n\nthemselves before God and immediately began to confess their own wrong-doing; and, oh, what a scene of repentance and confession there was! A most wonderful cleansing of the camp followed, and the mighty power of God was revealed.",
