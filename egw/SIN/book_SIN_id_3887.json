    "word": "The children of these complainers listen with open ears and receive the poison of disaffection. Parents are thus blindly closing the avenues through which the hearts of the children might be reached. How many families season their daily meals with doubt and questionings. They dissect the characters of their friends, and serve them up as a dainty dessert. A precious bit of slander is passed around the board to be commented upon, not only by adults, but by children. In this God is dishonored. Jesus said: \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\" Matthew 25:40. Therefore Christ is slighted and abused by those who slander His servants.",
