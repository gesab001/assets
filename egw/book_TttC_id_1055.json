    "word": "With the so-called dress reform there goes a spirit of levity and boldness just in keeping with the dress. Modesty and reserve seem to depart from many as they adopt that style of dress. I was shown that God would have us take a course consistent and explainable. Let the sisters adopt the American costume and they would destroy their own influence and that of their husbands. They would become a byword and a derision. Our Saviour says: \"Ye are the light of the world.\" \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" There is a great work for us to do in the world, and God would not have us take a course to lessen or destroy our influence with the world. \n\n                                               -",
