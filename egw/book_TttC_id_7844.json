How is the world to know that we belong to Christ, if we do nothing for Him? Said our Saviour: \"Ye shall know them by their fruits.\" And again: \"He that is not with Me is against Me.\" There is no neutral ground between those who work to the utmost of their ability for Christ and those who work for the adversary of souls. Everyone who stands as an idler in the vineyard of the Lord is not merely doing nothing himself, but he is a hindrance to those who are trying to work. Satan finds employment for all who are not earnestly striving to secure their own salvation and the salvation of others.",
