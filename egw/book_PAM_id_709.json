{"word": "Ministers or older members cannot have one-half the influence over young people as do other youth.--Young friends, if you take hold of the work right where you are at the present time, doing what you can, be sure that you will have the help of Jesus. Begin the work by laboring for your companions. Ministers, or church-members advanced in years, cannot have one-half the influence over your young associates that you are capable of exerting; and you ought to feel that a responsibility rests upon you to do all you can for their salvation.--HS 288.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 278}
