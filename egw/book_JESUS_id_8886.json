{"word": "But how often is the Lord neglected for the society of others, and for things of no value! . . . We dare not let His name languish on our lips, and His love and memory die out of our hearts. \\93Well,\\94 says the cold, formal professor, \\93this is making Christ too much like a human being;\\94 but the Word of God warrants us to have these very ideas. It is the want of these practical, definite views of Christ, that hinders so many from having a genuine experience in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. This is the reason that many are fearing and doubting and mourning. Their ideas of Christ and the plan of salvation are vague, dreary, and confused. . . . If ever there was a time when men needed the presence of Christ at their right hand, it is now, so that when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 29}
