    "word": "11, 12 (chs. 7:25; 8:6; see EGW on ch. 9:24). The Rewards of Christ's Sacrifice.--Christ's priestly intercession is now going on in the sanctuary above in our behalf. But how few have a real understanding that our great High Priest presents before the Father His own blood, claiming for the sinner who receives Him as his personal Saviour all the graces which His covenant embraces as the reward of His sacrifice. This sacrifice made Him abundantly able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him, seeing He liveth to make intercession for them (MS 92, 1899).",
