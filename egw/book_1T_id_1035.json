    "word": "There is a strange mixture of views among professed Sabbathkeepers in -----. Some are not in harmony with the body, and while they continue to occupy the position they now do, they will be subject to the temptations of Satan and will be affected with fanaticism and the spirit of error. Some have fanciful views which blind their eyes to important, vital points of truth, leading them to place their own fanciful inferences upon a level with vital truth. The appearance of such, and the spirit which attends them, makes the Sabbath which they profess very objectionable to the sensible unbeliever. It would be \n                                                                           414\nfar better for the progress and success of the third angel's message if such persons would leave the truth.",
