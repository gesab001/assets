{"word": "Churches, but Not Institutions in the Cities \n\n     Repeatedly the Lord has instructed us that we are to work the cities from outpost centers. In these cities we are to have houses of worship, as memorials for God, but institutions for the publication of our literature, for the healing of the sick, and for the training of workers, are to be established outside the cities. Especially is it important that our youth be shielded from the temptations of city life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CL", "page": 31}
