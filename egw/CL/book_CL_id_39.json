{"word": "Section III - An Appeal to Parents\n\n               Keep the Children From Hotbeds of Iniquity \n\n     Let no temporal advantages tempt parents to neglect the training of their children. Whenever possible, it is the duty of parents to make homes in the country for their children. The children and youth should be carefully guarded. They should be kept away from the hotbeds of iniquity that are to be found in our cities. Let them be surrounded by the influences of a true Christian home--a home where Christ abides.--Letter 268, 1906.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CL", "page": 12}
