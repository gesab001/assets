{"word": "Carefully Consider Every Move \n\n     Let everyone take time to consider carefully; and not be like the man in the parable who began to build, and was not able to finish. Not a move should be made but that movement and all that it portends are carefully considered--everything weighed. . . . To every man was given his work according to his several ability. Then let him not move hesitatingly, but firmly, and yet humbly trusting in God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CL", "page": 26}
