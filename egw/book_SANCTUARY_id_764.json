{"word": "The foundation firmly laid, we need wisdom that we may know how to build. When Moses was about to erect the sanctuary in the wilderness, he was cautioned, \"See that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount.\" In his law God has given us a pattern. Our character building is to be \"after the pattern showed to thee in the mount.\" The law is the great standard of righteousness. It \n                                                                           74\nrepresents the character of God, and is the test of our loyalty to his government. And it is revealed to us, in all its beauty and excellence, in the life of Christ. The law is the detector of sin. We have inspired testimony on this point: \"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came [home to the conscience], sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.\" Romans 7:9-11. This is the work that it will do for every soul that is living in sin. The law points out sin, and condemns it, and sends the sinner to Christ for pardon and cleansing. \"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 73}
