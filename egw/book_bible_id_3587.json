{"word": "But the people of God will not be misled. The teachings of this false christ are not in accordance with the Scriptures. His blessing is pronounced upon the worshipers of the beast and his image,--the very class upon whom the Bible declares that God's unmingled wrath shall be poured out. And, furthermore, Satan is not permitted to counterfeit the manner of Christ's advent. The Scriptures teach that \"as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be;\" [Matthew 24:27.] that he \"cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him;\" [Revelation 1:7.] that he will \"descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God;\" [1 Thessalonians 4:16.] that he will \"come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him,\" [Matthew 25:31.] and will \"send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect.\" [Matthew 24:31.] Those who have received the love of the truth will be shielded from the powerful delusion that takes the world captive. By the testimony of the Scriptures they will detect the deceiver in his disguise.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 443}
