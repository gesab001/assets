    "word": "God has no sympathy with the evildoer. He gives no one liberty to gloss over the sins of His people, nor to cry, \"Peace, peace,\" when He has declared that there shall be no peace for the wicked. Those who stir up rebellion against the servants whom God sends to deliver His messages are rebelling against the word of the Lord.",
