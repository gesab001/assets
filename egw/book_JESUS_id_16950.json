{"word": "Christ offers our prayers to the Father, mingled with the merit of His sacrifice, and they come up before God as sweet incense. . . . Whenever you are tempted to sin remember that Christ's eye is upon you, and that Satan desires to have you that he may sift you as wheat. Remember to send your petitions heavenward, and see Jesus making intercession for you. Send up an earnest cry to God, \"Lord, save me; I perish,\" and you will not be overcome; you will not enter into sin. Take your stand firmly on the words of Paul, and in the strength of Jesus say, \"In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord\" (Romans 8:37-39).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 286}
