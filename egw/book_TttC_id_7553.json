    "word": "Those who believe the truth should be determined to help and not to hinder the few in ----- ----- who are struggling under discouragements. The members of the church should each have a jealous care that the enemies of our faith have no occasion to triumph over their lifeless, backslidden state. Some have wasted their influence, when with a little self-denial, earnestness, and zeal, they might have been a power on the side of good. This zeal will not come without effort, without earnest struggles. If only three faithful souls were left in the ----- ----- church, they would, if connected with God, be living channels of light, and He would add to their numbers. God has raised up standard-bearers in ----- -----. Some have moved away, some have died, and some have become spiritually dead; their services are given to Satan. They do not realize that a by-and-by is coming when their account in the heavenly records will be balanced and when every man's work will be revealed of what sort it is.",
