    "word": "I solemnly warn you not to stand in an attitude similar to that of the unfaithful spies, who went up to view the land of promise. When these spies returned from their search, the congregation of Israel were cherishing high hopes and were waiting in eager expectancy. The news of their return is carried from tribe to tribe and is hailed with rejoicing. The people rush out to meet the messengers, who have endured the fatigue of travel in the dusty highways and under a burning sun. These messengers bring specimens of the fruit, showing the fertility of the soil. The congregation rejoice that they are to come into possession of so goodly a land; and they listen intently as the report is brought to Moses, that not a word shall escape them. \"We came unto the land whither thou sentest us,\" the spies begin, \"and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.\" The people are enthusiastic; they would eagerly obey the voice of the Lord and go up at once to possess the land.",
