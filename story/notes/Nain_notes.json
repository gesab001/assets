			"notes": ["Nain was a city located in the Lower Galilee, 14 kilometers (8.7 mi) south of Nazareth, where Jesus grew up and 3 kilomters south of Mount Tabor where Jesus was transfigured.  Cana is up here. The Sea of Galilee is over here. Capernaum is here by the Sea of Galilee. The Jordan river is this blue zigzag line here.", "Abigail and I have visited some of these places for our honeymoon back in 2010.  We rented a car and traveled around Israel for 7 days. Somebody once condemned me for visiting Israel.", "Ellen G. White had this to say about visiting Israel ,  'Among our workers are some who feel that a great object would be gained if their feet could tread the soil of old Jerusalem. But God's cause and work will never be advanced by His workers wandering about to find where Jesus traveled and wrought His miracles. Would you trace the footsteps of Christ, behold Him in that hovel, ministering to the poor; see Him at that sick bed, comforting the suffering, and speaking hope and courage to the desponding. Those who walk in the footsteps of Jesus will do as He did. 'Whosoever will come after me', He said,  'let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.'", "But I never went there thinking I would become a better missionary, preacher or Christian after visiting Israel.  I visited Israel just like many people like to visit America, or other countries.  Visiting Israel and visiting places where Jesus traveled will not help anyone to overcome sin.  The word of God is all we need.", "Now notice many of His disciples went with Him and much people.  Picture in your mind Jesus leading a huge crowd of people marching towards the city of Nain.  Because in the next verse we are about to read, there is also another huge crowd going in the opposite direction. And these two different crowds are going to meet and with Jesus being the center of attraction.", "There is always something exciting happening when Jesus is around. Are you following Jesus? Following Jesus is a very exciting life."]
