			"notes": ["The bible says, 'And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. '.  Nain was a city located in the Lower Galilee, 14 kilometers (8.7 mi) south of Nazareth, where Jesus grew up and 3 kilomters south of Mount Tabor where Jesus was transfigured. Cana is up here. The Sea of Galilee is over here. Capernaum is here by the Sea of Galilee. The Jordan river is this blue zigzag line here.", "Notice many of His disciples went with Him and much people. So many people were following Jesus.  Prior to this, he was healing people.  He had healed a man with a withered hand.  He had healed a very sick and dying centurion's servant.  So many others came just to touch Him and they were all healed.  Also He gave a powerful sermon about love, about loving your enemies, and doing good and lending without expecting anything in return.  He talked about being merciful, and not being judgmental, He talked about blessing those who curse you and doing good to those who hate you, and if someone hits your one cheek, let him also hit your other cheek.  He talked about giving, that we should give to anyone who asks, and if somebody takes away your stuff, don't ask for it back.   He talked about how we should treat others the way want to be treated.  We all want to be treated with love, respect, understanding, mercy, compassion.  And so we should also treat others the same way.  No wonder why people were just so attracted to Jesus.  But I am sure the Pharisees were also among the crowd to watch His every move.  They got very angry at Jesus for restoring the man's withered hand on the Sabbath a few days before.  Picture in your mind Jesus leading a huge crowd of people marching towards the city of Nain.  Because in the next verse we are about to read, there is also another huge crowd going in the opposite direction. And these two different crowds are going to meet and with Jesus being the center of attraction."],

			"notes": ["The next verse says, 'Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.'  Notice the word 'much people' is used to describe the amount of people in the funeral train. It is the same being used to describe the amount of people following Jesus,  The atmosphere in this crowd is one of mourning.  The atmosphere in Jesus crowd is one of joy.  Sorrow and joy meet by the city gate.  If you follow the news, there is much to be sorrowful about.  If we are following Jesus' crowd, the atmosphere is the opposite.  If we are following Jesus, we will be breathing in an atmosphere that is filled with hope, love and joy. ",  "The dead man is the only son of his mother.  I can't think of anything worse than for a woman to lose her only child.  Furthermore, the mother is a widow.   First, she loses her husband.  Then, she loses her only  son.  What a trajedy.  The good news is that help is on its way.  The Lord Jesus is on His way.  The bible says, 'For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.",  "Many people from the city of Nain attended this man's funeral.  Thousands of people all over the world are mourning for those have died because Covid.  Many have lost their wife, husband, mother, father, children, friend, church member, coworker.  Scientists have developed vaccines to stop people from dying of Covid.  The Covid vaccines are up to 94% effective, meaning there is a small chance it won't help you and you can still get infected and die from it. But God's vaccine is 100% effective.  When we believe in God's vaccine, the blood of Jesus, and accept Him as our Lord and Savior, we become 100% effectively immune from Death. Even though we die, we will live again."],

			"notes": ["The next verse says, 'And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.'  There are three points that I want to expand on this verse.", "First, the Lord saw her.  Ellen G. White says, 'Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and your fears before God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot weary Him. He who numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent to the wants of His children. The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. James 5:11. His heart of love is touched by our sorrows and even by our utterances of them. Take to Him everything that perplexes the mind.  The Lord sees you my friends.  He sees the sorrow, the pain, the struggles that you are going through.  The Lord saw me and my wife when my wife had a miscarriage.  He saw the pain, the tears, the disappointment that the loss brought to our hearts.  The Lord Jesus sees the tears of thousands of people around the world who have lost their loved ones to Covid-19.","Second, the Lord Jesus had compassion on her.  Compassion is sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others. When you show compassion, you are sensitive to the pain and sorrow that others feel.  When my first child was born, he was born with serious, life-threatening complications and went straight to the NICU and spent almost a month in the incubator.  The Lord Jesus had compassion on me when I was weeping before the Lord alone in the house when my wife was still in the hospital and my son was in the NICU.  The Lord Jesus has compassion on all the people who have lost their loved ones to Covid 19.  The Lord has compassion on you.  The bible says, '[It is of] the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.  [They are] new every morning: great [is] thy faithfulness.'", "Third, the Lord Jesus says to her, 'Weep not'.  The Lord says to us today, 'Weep not'.   He knows what you are going through.  He says to you Weep not.  The Lord Jesus invites us 'Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'"],

			"notes": ["The next verse says, 'And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare [him] stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.' There are three things I would like to talk about in this verse.",  "First, Jesus touches the bier.  There are a number of instances where the bible speaks of Jesus's touch or someone touching Him. Jesus touched a leper. He touched Peter's mother who was sick with fever.  A woman with an issue of blood for 12 years was healed after touching the hem of Jesus' garment. And many more were made whole after touching His garment.  We need the Lord's healing touch today.  ", "Second, they stood still.  Something wonderful happens when people stands still and watch what God is going to do.  The bible says, Be still and know that I am God.  The bible says in Exodus 14:13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.  Many people are afraid of Covid.  The covid vaccines are suppose to help us overcome our fear of Covid.  But people have lost their jobs for refusing vaccinations because they are afraid of it. But even after getting vaccinated, people are still afraid of Covid.   As Moses said to the people of Israel who were about to be destroyed by the powerful and mighty Egyptian army, I say to you, 'Fear ye not, stand still and behold Jesus dying on the cross for your sins.  Stand still and see God's ultimate plan of salvation  perfectly executed at the cross.   Job 37:14. Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.",  "Third, Jesus says to the young man, Arise.  It was a simple and gentle but powerful command. The Creator of the universe has built in humans, sophisticated voice recognition capabilities so that even when the system is completely shut down, in a destroyed condition, it is still able to hear and recognize the voice of the Creator. Are you feeling spiritually dead, hear the Lord Jesus say to you, 'Arise, arise'."],

			"notes": "And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. Notice the statement, 'He (Jesus) delivered him to his mother.' The Lord Jesus is in the business of reuniting families together again.  the Lord Jesus cares about parents and children being together.  He cares about husbands and wives being and staying together.  He cares about church members staying together.  1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, the bible says, For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.  When the Lord Jesus comes again, it will be the biggest family reunion of all time.  Children, mothers, fathers, friends who have died in the Lord will be raised back to life, never to be separated again.  The bible says, 'And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, [and be] their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. . There is coming a day When no heartaches shall come No more clouds in the sky No more tears to dim the eye All is peace forever more On that happy golden shore What a day, glorious day that will be What a day that will be When my Jesus I shall see When I look upon His face The One who saved me by His grace When He takes me by the hand And leads me to the Promised Land What a day, glorious day that will be There'll be no sorrows there And no more burdens to bear No more sickness and no more pain No more parting over there And forever I will be With the One who died for me What a day, glorious day that will be."

			"notes": "And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.  The bible says in Revelation 14:6-7,  And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.  The Lord Jesus turned this sad occassion into a joyful event that led people to fear God and to give Him glory.  The Covid-19 pandemic is bringing sadness and uncertainty to all.  There is so much uncertainty.  The media used to praise South Korea, India, Singapore as success stories for fighting the coronavirus.  But whenever people say, 'Peace and safety, sudden destruction comes'.  Even New Zealand initially had  a big celebration after the first lockdown last year, thinking they have defeated the virus.  But the virus has not given up on New Zealand and we have  had a couple more lockdowns. Many people have said that the vaccines are going to finally end all this, and we would all be back to normal very soon. But some experts are voicing their concerns that this is not going to happen thus causing more uncertainty.  But what I am 100% certain and the only thing I put my trust in is that the Lord Jesus is going  to turn this Covid-19 pandemic around.  He is going to use this pandemic as an opportunity to lead people of every nation, every tribe, every language all around the world to fear Him and to give Him glory.  The Covid-19 pandemic is worldwide.  The three angels' message is also worldwide.  The pandemic has set aside the preaching of the everlasting gospel in the churches to the masses as non-essential.  But this pandemic will simply make way for the Lord Jesus to work with greater power and many all around the world will fear and give glory to God. The three angels' message will accomplish its work. Do you want to be a part of it?"

			"notes": "The word 'rumour' appears twice in the New Testament. The other one is used in Matthew 24:6 where Jesus mentions 'rumours of war'.  The original Greek word used in rumours of war is ako, which means report. This is how we understand the word rumor in modern English, unverified report or story.  But in this story, the original Greek word for rumour is logos, which means word.  It is the same word used in John 1:1, In the beginning was the Word. And the word was with God and the word was God. So the people were not circulating a story or report of uncertain or doubtful truth.  The people were spreading the word of God. It is therefore say to say it like this, And this word of God went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.  God's people spread the word of God, not rumours, not gossip, not fake news, not conspiracy theories, not misinformation, not false information, not theories, not opinions, not doubts.  They spread the word of God.  We need to spread God's word more, not selfies, or the latest gadgets we own. or the interesting places we have been to.  The bible says in Hebrews 4:12, For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Satan has millions and millions of all kinds of books in his arsenal.  But God only has one, the Bible and the bible alone.  In the digital warfare, Satan and his evil angels have gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes, exabytes of data to win over and destroy the minds and hearts of men, women and children. And he has all these data freely available on Torrent sites, Youtube, Google Play Store, Apple's App Store, TikTok, Spotify, TV and Movie on Demand sites, Podcasts, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Adult sites, Wikipedia and others. But  no need to worry, they are no match for the pure words of the words of the Lord. The KJV bible in its  pure raw text file is only about 5 megabytes in size.    All of Satan's data are designed to enslave us to sin in the digital world. But all it takes to break free from the slavery of sin is 5 megabytes of data that contain the word of God. I have developed my own bible app for Fitbit and Galaxy Watch. You can install it in your smart watch if you have them. Look up my name Giovanni Saberon in the Fitbit App Gallery and Galaxy Store."

			"notes": "John the Baptist was  a fearless preacher, a great prophet, the Elijah of his day, a faithful forerunner, very humble missionary, a truly successful evangelist. But when he got locked up in jail,  and lost his freedom, life in lockdown, in isolation, life in quarantine, life in stay-at-home order, life in ECQ, GECQ, EECQ, life in unemployment, started to take a toll on him.  John the Baptist was expecting for Jesus to do what the Messiah was suppose to do, to end poverty, to bring down a corrupt political system. But Jesus seemed to be content with himself partying with sinners, healing and teaching.  Jesus was just a local doctor, a local teacher, when He should be King, Governor, General who will lead an army and crush the Roman empire and rule the world.   Ellen G. White said, 'As week after week passed, bringing no change, despondency and doubt crept over him. There were hours when the whisperings of demons tortured his spirit, and the shadow of a terrible fear crept over him.  It was just a short while ago that John the Baptist declared, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. And now he is wondering, 'Are you really the Messiah, or is there someone else? I am sure we have all experience doubts about the biblical truths we have been taught as God's people.  Is Ellen G. White really a prophet, is the Seventh-day Adventist Church really the remnant? Does God really exist?  Does the heavenly Sanctuary really exist?  Does God really want us to follow a plant-based diet? Didn't Jesus eat fish? Didn't the people of Israel consume dairy products? Does it really matter what religion the person I want to marry follows?  Is it really wrong to look at porn?  Is it really sin to separate and  divorce my spouse even though he or she has not commited adultery?  Does God really care how we dress?  Is it really sin to watch movies and tv shows that  contain profanity, adult scenes and God's name being blaspheme? May the Lord help us with our doubts. May we become firm in the truth and no longer  like a wave of the sea driven with the wind of false teachings and tossed."

			"notes": "When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?   Everyone of us will have our faith tested like John the Baptist.  The best way to handle doubts and unbelief when they crept into our minds is by following John the Baptist's example.  Ellen G. White said, 'John would not discuss his doubts and anxieties with his companions. He determined to send a message of inquiry to Jesus. This he entrusted to two of his disciples, hoping that an interview with the Saviour would confirm their faith, and bring assurance to their brethren. And he longed for some word from Christ spoken directly for himself.  Talk to Jesus about your doubts.  Its not a good idea  to post your doubts about God and His word on social media for everyone to see.  We will never really be able to fully explain the mysteries of God.  John the Baptist felt disappointed because he failed to understand the true nature of Christ's mission.  He thought like so many others that the Messiah would establish an earthly kingdom.  He failed to see that the kingdom that Jesus as the Messiah sought to establish is a kingdom that exists in our hearts and minds.  When the disciples came back to tell John what they had seen and heard of Jesus, it was enough.  He became firm in his conviction that Jesus is the Messiah. He understood according to Ellen G. White that Jesus was to do His work, not with the clash of arms and the overturning of thrones and kingdoms, but through speaking to the hearts of men by a life of mercy and self-sacrifice. In these times of crisis, may God's kingdom withint shine out of our hearts as we live the life of Jesus, a life that is overflowing with love, a life that is filled with hope, a life that is full of faith."
