There are a number of instances where the bible speaks of Jesus's touch or someone touching Him.
In Matthew 8:3. And Jesus put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 
In Matthew 8:15. And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.
In Matthew 9:20. And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind [him,] and touched the hem of his garment:
In Matthew 9:21. For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
In Matthew 9:29. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.
In Matthew 14:36. And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
In Matthew 17:7. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. This happened when Jesus was transfigured and the disciples were very afraid.

The Lord Jesus does not believe in social distancing.  Jesus doesn't get infected by viruses.  Jesus infects the virus with His healing power.  

After Jesus touched the bier, they stood still. Exodus 14:13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.

Joshua 3:8. And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

Job 37:14. Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.

Joshua 10:13. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. [Is] not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.


When Jesus gave His life on the cross, the whole universe stood still as they witnessed the greatest miracle of all time.  The miracle of God's amazing grace, his amazing love for this sinful world.  In Romans 5:6. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
