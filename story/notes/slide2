"The next verse says, 'And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.'"  There are three points that I want to expand on this verse."

"First, the Lord saw her."  Ellen G. White says, 'Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and your fears before God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot weary Him. He who numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent to the wants of His children. "The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy." James 5:11. His heart of love is touched by our sorrows and even by our utterances of them. Take to Him everything that perplexes the mind. Nothing is too great for Him to bear, for He holds up worlds, He rules over all the affairs of the universe. Nothing that in any way concerns our peace is too small for Him to notice. There is no chapter in our experience too dark for Him to read; there is no perplexity too difficult for Him to unravel. No calamity can befall the least of His children, no anxiety harass the soul, no joy cheer, no sincere prayer escape the lips, of which our heavenly Father is unobservant, or in which He takes no immediate interest. "He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds." Psalm 147:3. The relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full as though there were not another soul upon the earth to share His watchcare, not another soul for whom He gave His beloved Son.' 
The Lord sees you my friends.  He sees the sorrow, the pain, the struggles that you are going through.  The Lord saw me and my wife when my wife had a miscarriage.  He saw the pain, the tears, the disappointment that the loss brought to our hearts.  The Lord Jesus sees the tears of thousands of people around the world who have lost their loved ones to Covid-19.",

"Second, the Lord Jesus had compassion on her.  Compassion is sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others. When you show compassion, you are sensitive to the pain and sorrow that others feel.  The bible says, '[It is of] the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.  [They are] new every morning: great [is] thy faithfulness.'

"Third, the Lord Jesus says to her, 'Weep not'.  The Lord says to us today, 'Weep not'.  When my first child was born, he was born with complications and went straight to the ICU and spent almost a month in the incubator.  I remember weeping before the Lord alone in the house when my wife was still in the hospital and my son was in the ICU.  Please, I beg you, save my son.'
