8. And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where [was] a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, [that] as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

9. And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this [is] an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

10. Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.

11. And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.

12. And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.

13. And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what [is] to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.

14. And he said, What then [is] to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

15. And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.

16. And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, [thou] man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

17. And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.
