1. And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
2. And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that [were] before him.

3. And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
4. And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.

5. And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.

6. And Elijah the Tishbite, [who was] of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, [As] the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.

7. And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

8. Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that [is] before Jordan.

9. And it shall be, [that] thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

10. So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that [is] before Jordan.

11. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

12. And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
