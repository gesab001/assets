{"word": "And why were the doctrine and preaching of Christ's second coming so unwelcome to the churches? While to the wicked the advent of the Lord brings woe and desolation, to the righteous it is fraught with joy and hope. This great truth had been the consolation of God's faithful ones through all the ages; why had it become, like its Author, \\93a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense\\94 to his professed people? It was our Lord himself who promised his disciples, \\93If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself.\\94 [John 14:3.] It was the compassionate Saviour, who, anticipating the loneliness and sorrow of his followers, commissioned angels to comfort them with the assurance that he would come again in person, even as he went into heaven. As the disciples stood gazing intently upward to catch the last glimpse of him whom they loved, their attention was arrested by the words, \\93Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.\\94 [Acts 1:11.] Hope was kindled afresh by the angels\\92 message. The disciples \\93returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.\\94 [Luke 24:52, 53.] They were not rejoicing because Jesus had been separated from them and they were left to struggle with the trials and temptations of the world, but because of the angels\\92 assurance that he would come again.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 339}
