{"word": "HEAVEN\\92S KING.\\97When Christ came to this earth the first time, He came in lowliness and obscurity, and His life here was one of suffering and poverty. . . . At His second coming all will be changed. Not as a prisoner surrounded by a rabble will men see Him, but as heaven\\92s King. Christ \n71\nwill come in His own glory, in the glory of His Father, and in the glory of the holy angels. Ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of angels, the beautiful, triumphant sons of God, possessing surpassing loveliness and glory, will escort Him on His way. In the place of a crown of thorns, He will wear a crown of glory\\97a crown within a crown. In the place of that old purple robe, He will be clothed in a garment of whitest white, \\93so as no fuller on earth can white\\94 (Mark 9:3) it. And on His vesture and on His thigh a name will be written, \\93King of kings, and Lord of lords.\\94RH November 13, 1913 quoted in AG 358.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 70}
