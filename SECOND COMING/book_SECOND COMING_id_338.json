{"word": "In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, such a work as that of John the Baptist is to be done. God calls for men who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of the Lord. The message preceding the public ministry of Christ was \"Repent, publicans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees; repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\" (see Matthew 3:2). As a people who believe in Christ's soon appearing, we have a message to bear, \"Prepare to meet thy God.\" Our message is to be as direct as was the message of John. He rebuked kings for their iniquity. Notwithstanding that his life was imperiled, he did not hesitate to declare God's Word; and our work in this age must be done as faithfully. In order to give such a message as John gave, we must have a spiritual experience like his. . . . We must behold God, and in beholding Him, lose sight of self.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 308}
