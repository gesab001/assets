{"word": "Chapter 2 -- His Promise Will Be Fulfilled\n\nKEYNOTE OF SCRIPTURES.\\97One of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed in the Bible is that of Christ\\92s second coming to complete the great work of redemption. To God\\92s pilgrim people, so long left to sojourn in \\93the region and shadow of death,\\94 a precious, joy-inspiring hope is given in the promise of His appearing, who is \\93the resurrection and the life,\\94 to \\93bring home again His banished.\\94 The doctrine of the second advent is the very keynote of the Sacred Scriptures. From the day when the first pair turned their sorrowing steps from Eden, the children of faith have waited the coming of the Promised One to break the destroyer\\92s power and bring them again to the lost Paradise.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 13}
