{"word": "We believe the Sabbath of the fourth commandment because it is written plainly and is the foundation of our religious faith. Let none of us be ashamed of this. . . . We accept not the authority of men's councils, but we go further back, even to the councils of heaven. \"For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.\" (Psalm 119:89). We take a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Here we stand. A doctrine that has not a \"Thus saith the Lord\" may be accepted by the whole world, but that does not make it truth. . . . If we want to know the way to heaven we must study the Bible, not man-made theories or man's suppositions. . . . We are not at all ashamed of our faith, Seventh-day Adventism, for it is the very best specification we can have. We are waiting for the second coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Men may scoff and ridicule our faith, but this should not provoke or surprise us. All these demonstrations do not make the truth error, neither do they make error truth. We take our stand firmly and unmovably upon the platform of the Word of God. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 357}
