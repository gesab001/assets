{"word": "Enoch was a representative of Christ as surely as was the beloved disciple John. Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him. To him was committed the message of the second coming of Christ. \\93And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\\94 The message preached by Enoch, and his translation to heaven, were a convincing argument to all who lived in Enoch\\92s time. These things were an argument that Methuselah and Noah could use with power to show that the righteous would be translated.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 63}
