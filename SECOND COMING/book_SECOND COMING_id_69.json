{"word": "Very many raised their voices to cry, \"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!\" and left their brethren who did not love the appearing of Jesus, and who would not suffer them to dwell upon His second coming. I saw Jesus turn His face from those who rejected and despised His coming, and then He bade angels lead His people out from among the unclean, lest they should be defiled. Those who were obedient to the message \n                                                                           250\nstood out free and united. A holy light shone upon them.

Through these messages God has been bringing out His people where He can work for them in greater power, and where they can keep all His commandments.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 249}
