{"word": "Christ upon the Mount of Olives rehearsed the fearful judgments that were to precede His second coming: \"Ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: . . . Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows\" [Matthew 24:6-8]. While these prophecies received a partial fulfillment at the destruction of Jerusalem, they have a more direct application in the last days.--5T 753 (1899).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 18}
