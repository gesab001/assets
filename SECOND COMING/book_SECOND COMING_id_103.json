{"word": "The apostle Paul warned the church not to look for the coming of Christ in his day. \\93That day shall not come,\\94 he says, \\93except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed.\\94 [2 Thessalonians 2:3.] Not till after the great apostasy, and the long period of the reign of the \\93man of sin,\\94 can we look for the advent of our Lord. The \\93man of sin,\\94 which is also styled the \\93mystery of iniquity,\\94 the \\93son of perdition,\\94 and \\93that wicked,\\94 represents the papacy, which, as foretold in prophecy, was to maintain its supremacy for 1260 years. This period ended in 1798. The coming of Christ could not take place before that time. Paul covers with his caution the whole of the Christian dispensation down to the year 1798. It is this side of that time that the message of Christ's second coming is to be proclaimed.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 356}
